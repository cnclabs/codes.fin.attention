item business general development of business company background and overview 
daktronics  inc was founded by dr 
aelred kurtenbach and dr 
duane sander in while they were professors of electrical engineering at south dakota state university sdsu in brookings  south dakota 
our relationship with sdsu and other colleges and universities is a key factor contributing to our leadership in the industry 
we have been able to experience sustained long term growth due in part to the capability of the local universities and colleges to provide an important source of highly educated full time and student employees 
over the years  our products have evolved significantly from scoreboards and matrix displays and related software applications to complex  integrated visual display systems which include full color video  text and graphics displays located on a local or remote network and are tied together through sophisticated control systems 
in the mid nineties  as light emitting diodes leds became available in red  blue and green colors with outdoor brightness  we pioneered the development of full color led video displays capable of replicating trillions of colors  thereby producing large format video systems with excellent color  brightness  energy efficiency and lifetime 
due to our foundation of developing scoring and graphics display systems  in which we were already a leader  we were able to add video capabilities so all of our customer s large format display needs could be met in a complete  integrated system 
this has proven to be a key factor in daktronics becoming a leader in large electronic displays 
over the years  we have invested in product development to add complementary products and services  such as production services  control systems  liquid crystal display lcd networks  architectural lighting solutions  sound systems  marketing services  maintenance and support and other products and services for our customers 
business developments 
as a result of our line of led display systems and software applications  we gained significant market share through designing and manufacturing quality products and providing technical expertise and services 
our products are in use throughout the world  as we are the world s leader in all large format led display product categories  according to independent research 
in the sports and live events markets  our integrated video  scoring  and control systems  have been installed at many professional  collegiate and high school facilities  in north america  and at international multi purpose sports venues around the world 
with commercial applications  our video displays can be seen in major destination sites  such as las vegas and times square  while our digital billboards and message displays can be seen along roadsides  at retail establishments  and at many other locations 
in the transportation market  our vanguard displays are in use in numerous jurisdictions across north america 
our customers include many state departments of transportation  mass transit systems and airports 
one of our core growth strategies has been to enter geographic markets by developing regional sales and service presence providing after sale support to our entire product line and sales of our products 
we currently have regional offices in the united states as well as internationally that support our field sales and service people  many of whom today work out of their homes 

table of contents we occasionally acquire businesses providing access to new markets or complement our existing products 
although these acquisitions have increased the scope of services and technology we are able to provide  our primary growth objective is to increase sales and profitability through organic growth 
we manufacture most of our products in south dakota and minnesota 
we also invested in facilities in shanghai  china  where we manufacture our architectural lighting products and perform final assembly for video displays for the chinese market 
we also have a plant in victor  new york which produces our rigging products 
in may of we completed the acquisition of a small manufacturing operation in belgium  primarily serving the third party advertising market 
description of business we are the world s leading supplier of electronic scoreboards  large electronic display systems  digital messaging solutions  software and services for sporting  commercial and transportation applications 
we serve our customers by providing superior products  integration and services providing dynamic  reliable and unique visual communication solutions 
we offer a complete line of products  from small indoor and outdoor scoreboards and electronic displays to large multi million dollar video display systems as well as related control  timing  sound and hoist systems and related professional services 
we are recognized worldwide as a technical leader with the capabilities to design  market  manufacture  install and service complete integrated systems displaying real time data  graphics  animation and video 
we are engaged in a full range of activities marketing and sales  engineering and product development  manufacturing  technical contracting  professional services and customer service and support 
each of those activities is described below 
marketing and sales 
our products have been sold throughout the united states and other countries through a combination of direct sales personnel and resellers 
in the united states and canada  we use primarily a direct sales force for professional sports  colleges and universities  convention centers and smaller sports facilities  including high schools and transportation applications 
in smaller commercial applications  we rely primarily on resellers 
we also utilize resellers outside north america on large video system projects where we do not have a direct sales presence 
sales to resellers generally have terms consistent with sales directly to end users 
the majority of the products sold by resellers in north america are standard catalog products 
these are typically moderately priced and relatively easy to install 
a limited number of models are built to inventory and available for quick delivery 
we support our resellers through direct mail advertising  trade journal advertising  trade show exhibitions and our sales force support in the field 
we believe we can expand sales and  in some niches  market share  by expanding both our direct sales force and resellers 
resellers outside north america focus on large integrated system sales 
our sales force is comprised of sales staff located throughout the world supporting all customer types in both sales and service 
in addition to supporting resellers as described above  the direct sales staff sells the entire range of our standard products and substantially all of the large video display systems 
our sales staff is structured in a way to maximize cross selling opportunities across segments 
we have organized our business into five business units which have a primary focus on particular markets or customer segments 
there are four domestic business units united states and canada commercial  live events  schools and theatres and transportation 
the fifth business unit identified as international is for all operations outside the united states and canada 
this structure allows us to focus on serving the unique needs of each of these customer groups 
live events customers usually have a large variety of products tied into a system in a single location involving creative production services  design and event support 
the commercial business unit serves the needs created by large and remote networks of displays connected through various modes of communication 
the transportation business unit focuses on the unique needs of governmental contractors and ties into integrated systems managing the flow of travelers and vehicles 
finally  the schools and theatre business unit focuses on providing information displays to high schools for both sports and marquee applications and automated rigging for theatres 
the international business unit comprises all of these areas outside of north america 
when we target a potential customer for sales opportunities  the prospect is contacted either directly or through a reseller 
frequently  on larger sales opportunities  engineers  technicians and sales personnel jointly participate in site visits to assess site conditions  evaluate the customer s requirements and present proposals 
proposals to prospective customers include business and technical presentations as well as product demonstrations and visits to existing installations 
we also regularly host customers at our various manufacturing facilities to demonstrate product quality  manufacturing and design capabilities 
international sales can fluctuate from year to year based on the timing of large system projects 
a typical term of sale for international projects includes a letter of credit  bank guarantee or partial payment in advance 
we believe in addition to the growth we expect domestically  we will also achieve growth in the international markets 
during fiscal years  and  approximately percent  percent and percent of our net sales  respectively  were derived from international sales 
since  we have acquired or opened international offices in canada  china  france  the united arab emirates  germany  australia  japan  brazil  spain  singapore  macau  hong kong  belgium and the united kingdom 

table of contents much of our marketing and sales success in the past was based on our ability to create new products and product enhancements for customers by understanding their needs and opportunities 
we have developed and continue to develop this understanding through active participation in the sales cycle by engineers and other personnel 
we attend trade shows  conventions  seminars and foster a culture of teamwork throughout the organization 
engineering and product development 
the large format electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services 
to remain competitive  we must continue to anticipate and respond to changes and developments in the industry 
we will continue our tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to help achieve more effective product development by investing approximately four percent of our net sales over the long term into product design and development 
we employ engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design  applications engineering  software design and customer and product support 
we use primarily in house engineering to anticipate and respond rapidly to the product development needs of customers and the marketplace 
we assign product managers to each product or product family to assist our sales staff in training and implementing product improvements and to ensure each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability 
we also invest in new creative technologies and in companies developing new technologies 
our product development staff consists of four groups sports  video  commercial and transportation 
the sports product development group is aligned with the schools and theatres business unit  the video group is aligned with the live events  international and commercial business units  and the commercial and transportation groups are aligned with the commercial and transportation business units  respectively 
these groups leverage common technology  concepts and platforms through various knowledge centers spanning across all groups 
this alignment has driven improved product reliability  lower costs and better functionality for our customers 
the development of these knowledge centers and various other practices within product development are modeled after best practices for lean product development 
manufacturing 
as a vertically integrated manufacturer of display systems  we perform most sub assembly and substantially all final assembly of our products 
our manufacturing operations include component manufacturing and system manufacturing metal fabrication  electronic assembly  sub assembly and final assembly 
we flex our production capacity through varying work hours and strategic outsourcing 
we use a modular approach for manufacturing displays 
standard product modules are designed to be used in a variety of different products 
this modular approach reduces parts inventory and improves manufacturing efficiency 
we inventory a limited supply of finished standard products 
custom projects are built according to the customer s specifications through the use of common components 
product modules are designed so a custom product may include a significant percentage of standard components to maximize reliability and ease of service 
a key strategy of ours is to increase standardization and commonality of parts and manufacturing processes across product lines through product platform strategies 
our order entry  production  customer service and many other functions are also consolidated through an enterprise resource planning system and a service operations system to facilitate the sales  design  production and delivery process 
our plants are loosely aligned with the five business units described above 
this alignment has been critical to allow us to respond to the different types of customers in the different business units in areas such as lead times and product consolidation 
furthermore  we have decentralized to these plants certain functions such as materials planning and scheduling 
our goal was to generally align sales  marketing  engineering and manufacturing into a cohesive business unit with a focus on customers while not giving up the synergies of shared resources 
on the other hand  given the cyclical nature of some parts of our business  we also needed to balance and maintain our ability to manufacture the same products across our plants so we can smooth out the peaks and valleys of customer demand of the various business units 
our manufacturing facilities have embraced lean manufacturing techniques throughout all areas 
we have also placed significant emphasis on lean techniques in the non manufacturing areas 
although there are direct costs associated with implementing lean techniques  the goal of doing so is to eliminate waste and deliver products to a customer timely  while maintaining minimal inventory and eliminating non value added tasks 
technical contracting 
we serve as a technical contractor for larger display system installations requiring custom designs and innovative product solutions 
the purchase of display systems typically involves competitive proposals 
as part of our response to a proposal request  we may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in analyzing the optimal type of display system 
we usually include in our proposal site preparation and installation services related to the display system 
in these cases  we serve as a contractor and may retain subcontractors 
we are licensed in a number of domestic jurisdictions as a general contractor 
typically  we outsource all related electrical  steel and installation labor to qualified subcontractors 
we have developed 
table of contents relationships with many subcontractors throughout the united states overtime  which is advantageous for us in bidding and delivering on these projects 
professional services 
our professional services are essential to continued market penetration and growth 
professional services we provide in addition to technical contracting include event support  content creation  product maintenance  marketing assistance  training on hardware and software  control room design  and continuing technical support for operators of complicated display systems 
our sports marketing division assists customers with marketing and ad sales for sports facilities to fund display system purchases 
typically  we render these services to facilities which do not have in house marketing programs and staff 
customer service and support 
we offer limited warranties on our products against failure due to defective parts or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to five years after the first sale or installation  depending on the product or type of customer 
in addition  we offer service agreements of various scopes 
to serve our customers we provide help desk access  parts repair and replacement and programming support for video  animation and other displays 
we staff our technical help desk with experienced technicians who are on call hours a day to support events and sites 
our repair centers  located in the united states  germany and shanghai  are staffed with trained technicians who repair and return components requiring service 
we also offer a component exchange program for same day shipment of replacement parts 
we also have a staff of field service personnel trained across product lines and business units allowing us to better focus on the commonality of the products rather than the unique needs of each customer 
we also use third party service partners to improve the overall utilization of our field service staff as the needs of the customer fluctuate greatly during the fiscal year 
this allows us to respond to changes in volume of service  which peaks in the late summer and early fall 
general description of our products and technologies our range of products spans from message displays  to scoreboards  to audio systems  to large complex systems 
the two principal components of our systems are the display and the controller 
we produce displays varying in complexity  size and resolution 
the physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area  the distance from the viewer to the display  and the amount and type of information to be displayed 
generally  for longer distance viewing  the light sources  or pixels  are larger and spaced farther apart 
the type of the display may also depend on the location of the viewing audience 
for example  arena scoreboards may have a viewing angle nearly as wide as degrees  compared with roadside displays  which typically are viewed from a passing vehicle only within a narrow angle from the display 
we customize our products according to the design specifications of the customer and the conditions of the environment in which our products function 
the controller uses computer hardware and our software products to process information provided by the operator and other integrated sources and then compiles the information  graphics or animation to be presented on the displays 
product families and technologies our products are comprised of the following primary product families  all of which include control systems and software video display systems scoring and timing systems message displays its dynamic message signs audio systems digital billboards digit and price displays automated rigging and hoists each of these product families is described below 
video display systems 
this group consists primarily of displays comprised of a large number of full color pixels capable of showing various levels of video  graphics and animation plus controllers which manage the operation of the display 
video displays are comprised of red  green and blue leds arranged in various combinations to form pixels picture elements 
the electronic circuitry which controls the pixels allows for variances in the relative brightness of each led to provide a full color spectrum  thereby displaying video images in striking  vibrant colors 

table of contents we offer a wide range of video display systems for different applications and budgets 
variables in video displays include the spacing of the pixels pixel pitch  the resolution of the displays number of pixels  the brightness of the displays nits  the number of discrete colors the display is able to produce color depth  and the viewing angles 
in addition  modular design allows the product to be readily configured in custom sizes to meet each customer s specific requirements  with virtually no limit to the size a display can be built 
we offer a wide range of pixel spacing  ranging from four millimeter to millimeter 
the four millimeter application provides the user with the greatest pixel density and shortest viewing distance  while the millimeter is the most cost effective for physically large displays with longer viewing distances 
in addition  the uniformity of colors across the display is important to the quality of the video image 
our unique display control circuitry  along with our proprietary manufacturing and calibration procedures  provide uniform colors across the display 
in addition to traditional rectangular video displays  we have adapted led video technology into ribbon board displays and modular display systems 
our ribbon board display systems are configured in different height to width ratios to give arenas and stadiums the ability to install long  narrower bands of displays in the facility 
for new construction projects  our prorail attachment system is combined with ribbon board technology to provide improved sight lines for fans and reduce construction costs for the facility s owner 
digital ribbon boards generally serve as a revenue generation source for teams and facilities through advertising as well as another location to display information such as scoring and statistics 
our transportable display systems are comprised of lightweight individual led video panels less than a square meter in size are assembled together to form a display in a customizable height and width 
these panels are used in what we refer to as mobile and modular applications  such as touring shows and the events market 
our video systems may use a network of displays to deliver a pre programmed schedule of advertisements  relevant entertainment information and sports scores  including video  audio  graphics and live data to viewers in the concourses and club areas 
the network can be integrated with the main video displays through the control system  providing complete control 
daktronics digital display networks can incorporate flat panel screens  led message displays  led video screens and even numeric scoreboards to provide an even better game day experience 
our gkd mediamesh product can turn any building facade into a dynamic communications medium while not concealing the architecture behind it 
this display can be mounted over a solid facade or in front of windows knowing the finished solution is free from visible cabling  and it delivers a clean  semi transparent viewing experience for those within the building 
the stainless steel  textile like mesh provides a modern  urban feel while the thin profile design less than one inch in depth provides an elegant  refined structural appearance 
our line of propixel led architectural lighting and display products include our freeform video elements  which are available as individual pixels or strips of pixels  assembled and interconnected to transform structures into stunning visual landmarks 
flexible mounting platforms allow designers to transform structures into full motion video displays and to create various effects 
these elements can be structured in various resolutions depending on the application 
the freeform video elements are managed by our various controllers  depending on the specific application 
the primary control components for video displays in live event applications are show control  proprietary digital media players and proprietary video processors 
these control components provide advanced capability for the display of live video and real time content on our displays 
our show control software suite is an integrated display control system enabling flexible  intuitive display control and event management for large video applications 
the show control software suite can operate entire networks of displays from a single  intuitive control interface 
features such as smart buttons allow users to instantly deliver media clips  camera feeds  and streaming information to any display in a network 
daktronics digital media players store recorded video clips and can function as a still store and character generator 
managed through our show control software suite  the digital media player provides instant access to any video  animation  graphic or real time data files on a player 
it also controls the overall picture settings of any daktronics led display  making it the most feature rich product of its kind in the live events industry 
we also provide a proprietary video processing system developed specifically for led display technology 
for larger venues hosting live events  the show control software suite  digital media player and video processor are typically part of a larger system with cameras  switchers and other components 
these systems provide the ability to show instant replays  live action video  prerecorded video clips  and overlays of scoring  timing and statistical information 
we occasionally package our components with control components from other suppliers to provide a complete video production solution 

table of contents scoring and timing systems

indoor systems range in complexity from two digit shot clocks and small scoreboards to large  center hung scoreboards incorporating video displays  message centers  advertising panels  hoist systems and control software 
outdoor scoreboards range in complexity from two digit game timers and small scoreboards to larger systems incorporating scoring  timing  video  message centers  advertising panels and control software 
we expect led technology will remain the technology of choice for scoreboards and displays due to its lower power consumption  longer life and resulting lower maintenance costs as compared to other technologies 
because most of the scoreboards and display products within this group have significant standardization  we have been able to make progress on our goal of efficiently delivering high quality products 
we offer a variety of internally developed controllers complementing our scoreboards and displays 
these controllers vary in price and complexity from the all sport  a handheld controller for portable scoreboards  to the all sport series  designed for more sophisticated scoring systems and allowing for more user defined options

financial information about segments and geographic areas our operations in countries outside the us are accompanied by various risks  including financial risks 
relationships with customers and terms of sale vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the us currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect net sales from  and the profitability of  operations outside the us we attempt to hedge these exposures to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on net earnings 
in addition  although we do not have the intention to do so  the repatriation of certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries may result in substantial us tax cost 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for financial information pertaining to our business segments and geographic operations 
sources of raw materials we source some of our materials  such as leds  power supplies  from a limited number of suppliers  primarily due to the proprietary nature of the material 
the loss of one of these key suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 
however  our sourcing group works to implement strategies to mitigate the associated risks 
for additional information  refer to item a risk factors 
from time to time  we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the length of the contract  which generally does not exceed one year 
intellectual property we continually assess the cost or benefit of filing patents related to new products 
we apply for patents to document our rights to the technology so other parties cannot later claim ownership a defensive strategy and to also allow us to pursue infringement claims against competitors for protection due to patent violations an offensive strategy 

table of contents we rely on trademarks  in addition to patents  to help establish and preserve proprietary protection for our products 
our trademarks are registered in the united states and other countries 
these trademarks are used to establish brand recognition and distinction in our various markets 
product drawings  software  training and product manuals and other works of authorship are also subject to applicable copyright law protections 
we provide software to our customers in object code to help preserve our intellectual property rights 
we also rely on nondisclosure and license agreements with our employees to protect our intellectual property 
despite these intellectual property protections  there can be no assurance a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products 
seasonal nature of the business our sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the seasonality of our business and variability due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for facilities where professional  major college  or international sports events take place and large commercial display systems 
as a result of the seasonality of the business  primarily due to the sports market  net sales and net income tend to be lower in the third quarter of a fiscal year 
the seasonality of the sports business is caused by sales related to facilities for football  basketball and hockey in the summer and fall and for baseball in the early to late spring  leaving a slower time in the winter 
this seasonal effect can be compounded by large product orders in the sports markets and by the effects of holidays during our third fiscal quarter 
the effects of seasonality are generally not as great in our commercial  international and transportation business units  although the impact of large orders in those markets and the implications of weather during the winter months of the northern hemisphere can cause fluctuations in net sales and profits 
gross margins on large orders tend to fluctuate more than the gross margins on smaller orders 
large product orders with competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins with greater variability in margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on the majority of these larger orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
working capital items on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders 
to the extent these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
customers the primary markets we serve  along with primary types of customers  are as follows markets types of customers live events large colleges and universities  professional sports teams and facilities  national and international sports games and federations  civic arenas and convention centers  live entertainment venues  staging and rental  and motor racing 
schools and theatres elementary and secondary schools  small colleges and universities  local recreation centers and theatres 
commercial retailers and outdoor advertisers  auto dealers  gaming facilities  petroleum retailers  restaurants and quick serve restaurants  shopping centers  worship venues  and spectaculars 
transportation state and local departments of transportation  airlines  airports and related industries  parking facilities and transit authorities 
we have a large and diverse worldwide customer base and are not economically dependent on any single customer  however  there are important customers within each of our business units and the loss of one or more customers could have an adverse effect on us 
within our commercial business unit  two major customers account for more than percent of our digital billboard sales niche 
backlog our backlog consists of customer sales agreements or purchase orders we expect to fill within the next months and was approximately million as of april  and million as of april  because sales agreements and purchase orders may be subject to extended delivery schedules our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income 
although orders for 
table of contents many of our products may be shipped within days  other orders may take longer depending on the customer s project schedule or other factors 
contracts related to new construction projects generally tend to have the longest lead times 
government and other regulation in the united states and other countries  various laws and regulations  including zoning ordinances  restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays  particularly in the commercial market 
these laws and regulations impose greater restrictions on electronic displays versus non electronic displays such as traditional billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety if a display is located near a road or highway 
these factors may prevent or inhibit us from selling products to some prospective customers 
some of our products are tested to safety standards developed by underwriters laboratories in the united states  as well as similar standards in other countries 
we design and produce our products in accordance with these standards 
our manufacturing operations use certain chemical products and chemical processes subject to various environmental rules and regulations 
our manufacturing operations must also meet numerous safety related rules and regulations 
we believe we are in material compliance with applicable governmental laws and regulations 
in some countries in which we operate  such as china  there are various laws and regulations which may affect our operations 
these include restrictions or limitations on our ability to withdraw our capital investment  undeveloped legal frameworks to enforce our rights including payment collections  and different levels of enforcement and consistency of laws 
competition the large electronic display industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition from a variety of sources 
there are a number of established suppliers of competing products which may have greater market penetration in certain of our market niches or greater financial  marketing and other resources 
competitors also attempt to copy our products or product features 
because a customer s budget for the purchase of a large screen electronic display is often part of their advertising budget  we may also compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
there are generally more competitors in product categories and applications requiring less complicated display systems  such as the high school scoreboard market  the text and graphics display market and the market for less customized video displays 
as the needs of customers increase and the display systems become more complex  there are generally fewer competitors 
however  due to the high profile nature of larger complex display systems  the competition is intense on those projects 
within our standard product business  which includes our galaxy display lines  our digital billboard product  and scoreboard products  there are a large number of competitors  none of which we consider to be dominant 
in addition  there are a significant number of asian competitors attempting to sell in the marketplace  which generally compete on the basis of price 
we generally compete based on our local presence  our depth of service  and the wide range of our product offerings 
within our large video system business  across all segments  there are various competitors with different levels of strength in individual niches  but none have a dominant position overall 
for example  a single competitor may have strength in the mobile video business but very little in the fixed installation business 
another competitor may have strength in the billboard display business but very little strength in any other large display applications 
in addition  our large display business has competitors in a narrow niche which were significant at one time and then substantially decreased their presence in the niche 
these changes seem to happen as a result of the complexities of the marketplace and the failures experienced on installations which receive a great deal of visibility 
our video systems  especially those systems comprised of many displays networked together  are highly complex and visible and thus require a high standard of performance difficult for other industry participants to maintain over the long term 
there are a growing number of asian based competitors expanding their presence beyond asia to compete more directly with us 
these competitors generally offer products and solutions at a lower price 
each of our business units tends to have a different set of competitors 
some competitors only compete in our transportation business and some primarily compete in the high school market  for example 
video display competitors compete for our live events  international  and commercial video business 
overall  we compete based on our broad range of products and features  complementary services  advanced technology  prompt delivery  and reliable and readily available customer service and support 
we also strive to provide cost effective products and solutions for our customers 
contrary to our focus on technologically advanced products and customer support  some of our competitors compete in some markets by providing lower cost display systems  which are of a lesser quality with lower product performance or less customer support 
if a customer focuses principally on price  we are less likely to obtain the sale 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance our existing products  introduce new products and product features  and provide customers with cost effective solutions to their display needs 

table of contents research and development we believe our engineering and product development capability and experience will continue to be a very important factor to continue to develop the most up to date digital displays and control system solutions desired by the market 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
environmental concerns our products and production processes require the storage  use and disposal of a variety of chemicals considered hazardous under applicable federal and state laws 
accordingly  we are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements for the handling and disposal of such materials 
we do not anticipate any material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position due to compliance with government regulations involving environmental matters 
employees as of april   we employed approximately  full time employees and approximately part time and temporary employees 
of these employees  approximately were in manufacturing  were in sales and marketing  were in customer service  were in engineering and were in general and administrative 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors a number of risks and uncertainties exist which could impact our future operating results 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  competition  our success in developing new products and technologies  market acceptance of new products and other factors  including those set forth below 
we engage in a highly competitive business 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we could lose market share and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we operate in highly competitive markets  some of which are highly fragmented 
we also compete against products produced in asia and other parts of the world  including the us  which in some cases are of lower quality or performance and lower cost 
in addition  because a customer s budget for the purchase of an electronic display is often part of their advertising budget  our products often compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
competition could result in not only a reduction in net sales but also in the prices charged by us for our products 
to remain competitive  we must be able to not only anticipate and respond quickly to our customers needs and enhance our existing products and services to meet those needs  but also continue to price our products competitively 
our competitors may develop cheaper  more efficient products  or they may be willing to charge lower prices for strategic marketing or to increase market share 
some competitors have more capital and other resources and may be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  which could negatively affect our ability to compete effectively 
our results of operations can be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts and the size and timing of large contracts 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts  primarily in the professional and major college sports facilities market  the outdoor advertising niche and for large spectaculars around the world and the amounts and timing of these contracts 
when awarded large contracts  the timing and amount could cause material fluctuations in our net sales and earnings 
awards of large contracts and their timing and amount are difficult to predict and are outside of our control 
our products are covered by warranties  and fulfilling these warranties could adversely affect our financial results 
unanticipated warranty and other costs for defective products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reputation 
we provide warranties on our products generally for terms of five years or less 
in addition  in response to customer needs  we regularly offer extended warranties 
these warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products and meet certain performance standards  among other customary warranty provisions 
although we continually monitor our warranty claims and provide a reserve for estimated warranty issues on an on going basis  an unanticipated claim could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in some cases  we may be able to subrogate a claim back to a subcontractor or supplier if the subcontractor or supplier supplied the defective product or performed 
table of contents the service  but this may not always be possible 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products  reduce profits and adversely affect our reputation 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly  which could have a material effect on the price of our common stock 
our quarterly revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
contracts we enter into generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more  which subjects the timing of revenue recognition to many factors beyond our control 
in addition  the timing and size of large contract orders and delivery may not be predictable or repeatable 
furthermore  because significant portions of our operating costs are fixed  an unanticipated delay or cancellation of orders in backlog may have a significant negative impact on our quarterly operating results 
factors causing our operating results to vary may include new product introductions  variations in product and project mix and delivery due date changes 
therefore  quarterly operating results may be subject to significant variations  and operating results in one quarter may not be indicative of future operating results 
we enter into fixed priced contracts on a regular basis  which could reduce our profits 
the majority of our contracts we enter into to sell our products are on a fixed price basis 
if our actual costs exceed original estimates on fixed price contracts  our profits will be reduced 
although we benefit from cost savings  we have a limited ability to recover cost overruns 
because of the large scale and long duration of some contracts  unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors including  but not limited to  increases in the cost or shortages of components  materials or labor  unanticipated technical problems  required project modifications not initiated by the customer  and suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform or a delay in performing their obligations 
these factors could delay delivery of products  and contracts may provide for liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated costs unable to be passed on to customers or the payment of liquidated damages under fixed contracts would negatively impact our profits 
backlog may not be indicative of future revenue or profitability 
customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control 
orders normally contain cancellation provisions to permit our recovery of costs expended and a portion of the anticipated profit if a customer cancels an order 
if a customer elects to cancel  we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog 
if projects are delayed  the timing of revenues could be affected  and projects may remain in the backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over longer periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays and cost changes 
if we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter  fluctuations in the levels of the quarterly backlog can result because the backlog may reach levels which may not be sustained in subsequent quarters 
for these reasons  backlog may not be indicative of future revenues 
large contracts with significant customers represent a significant portion of our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
we closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and have not  to date  experienced significant credit losses 
significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk  to some extent  by requiring deposits  payments prior to shipment  progress payments and letters of credit 
however  because some of the exposure is outside of our control  unanticipated events could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
general price increases or significant shortages of raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating margin 
we purchase large quantities of raw materials and components  including  but not limited to  aluminum  leds  power supplies  circuit boards and various other electronic components 
materials comprise the largest component in our cost of goods sold 
unless  to the extent described above  we have multiple sources of supply for many of our raw materials  significant shortages could disrupt the supply of raw materials 
further increases in the price of these raw materials and components could further increase our product costs and materially adversely affect margins 
although we attempt to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases to customers  we may decide not to do so for competitive reasons 
even when our price increases are successful  the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind the incurrence of higher costs 
as of the date of this report  there were no material parts shortages in the market place impacting our business 
we depend on single source suppliers for some of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
we obtain some of our raw materials  including  but not limited to  leds  power supplies  circuit boards and plastics  from a limited number of suppliers 
if we cannot obtain key raw materials from our suppliers  the raw materials may not be readily available from other suppliers  other suppliers may not agree to supply the materials to us on terms as favorable as the terms we currently receive  or the raw materials from any other suppliers may not be of adequate and consistent quality 
although we believe our supply of raw materials currently is adequate for the needs of our business  we cannot assure that new sources of supply will be available when needed 
any interruption in our supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is located and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing product market 
the electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product improvement  innovations and developments in display and controller technology 
competitors could develop new or superior products to increase their share of the markets 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend in part on our ability to continue to understand their needs and to make timely and cost effective product improvements  innovations and developments 

table of contents our international operations are exposed to additional risk and uncertainties  including unfavorable political developments  weak foreign economies  and compliance with foreign governmental requirements  which may impact our results of operations 
for fiscal years  and  revenue outside the united states represented approximately percent  percent and percent of our consolidated net sales  respectively 
our operations and earnings throughout the world have been and may in the future be adversely affected from time to time in varying degrees by war  political developments  foreign laws and regulations  regional economic uncertainty  recessions  or other economic crises  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including logistical and communication challenges  political instability  restrictions  customs and tariffs  changing regulatory environments  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries whether due to cultural  exchange rate or other factors  lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights  renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts  compliance with import export laws  us government policy and foreign tax laws with potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect on us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
these factors may result in a decline in net sales or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to expand our business outside of the united states 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and other key employees  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees 
the loss of certain members of our senior management  including our chief executive officer or successor chief executive officer  could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy 
our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with the executive officers or other employees  but we do maintain key person life insurance on the lives of our chairman of the board and our chief executive officer 
we may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements  which may negatively affect our business and operating results 
we increase our production capacity and the overhead supporting production based on anticipated market demand 
market demand  however  has not always developed as expected or remained at a consistent level 
the potential underutilization risk can decrease our profitability 
the following factors complicate accurate capacity planning for market demand changes in the demand for and mix of products our customers buy our ability to add and train our manufacturing staff in advance of demand the market s pace of technological change variability in our manufacturing productivity long lead times for our plant and equipment expenditures  requiring major financial commitments well in advance of actual production requirements 
a future deterioration of our business could result in further underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  resulting in an impairment of certain assets at some point 
our inability to plan our capacity requirements accurately and efficiently utilize our production capacity  or our failure to put in place the technologies and capacity necessary to meet market demand  could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
regulations related to the use of conflict free minerals may increase our costs and cause us to incur additional expenses 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability of the use by public companies in their products of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals 
as a result  the securities and exchange commission enacted new annual disclosure and reporting requirements for public companies who use these minerals in their products  which apply to us 
under the final rules  we are required to conduct due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products 
because our supply chain is broad based and complex  we may not be able to easily verify the origins for all minerals used in our products 
we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we are implementing 
in addition  the new rules could reduce the number of suppliers who provide components and products containing conflict free minerals and thus could increase the cost of the components used in manufacturing our products and the costs of our products to us 
any increased costs and expenses could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements  our management is required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the dates of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include the recognition of contract revenue  costs  profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion  estimated amounts for warranty costs  collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts  the amount of estimated liabilities  valuation of assets acquired plus liabilities  goodwill  and intangible assets assumed in acquisitions  and 
table of contents valuation of stock based compensation 
our actual results could differ from our estimates of such results  which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be inadequate  our financial results may not be accurate  raising concerns for investors and potentially adversely affecting our stock price 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the fiscal years ended april   april  and april  and will continue to do so for future periods 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  implementing improvements  or receiving a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm 
in addition  our assessment of internal controls may identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters which may raise concerns for investors and therefore adversely affect our stock price 
our future results may be affected by legal compliance risks related to the us foreign corrupt practices act and other anti bribery laws for the countries in which we operate 
we are required to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act  which prohibits united states companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
it also requires us to maintain specific record keeping standards and adequate internal accounting controls 
foreign companies  including some of our competitors  are not subject to these prohibitions and requirements 
corruption  extortion  bribery  pay offs  theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in many jurisdictions  including the middle east and the people republic of china china 
if our competitors engage in these practices  they may receive preferential treatment from companies or governmental agencies  resulting in a competitive advantage for securing business from these companies or government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses or permits  which would put us at a disadvantage 
in addition  although we inform our personnel through training sessions  policies and other means such practices are illegal  we cannot assure our employees or agents will not engage in such conduct for which we may be held responsible even if we are not aware of such conduct 
if our employees or agents are found to have engaged in such practices  we could suffer severe fines and penalties 
product liability claims not covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage to protect us in the event of such a claim  our coverage may be inadequate to cover litigation and or the potential award 
also  a well publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
our operations in china subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to china laws and regulations 
we have offices and manufacturing facilities and make sales to customers in china which encompass many different activities 
under its current leadership  the government of china has been pursuing economic reform policies  including encouraging of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization 
however  the government of china may not continue to pursue such policies 
despite progress in developing its legal system  china does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws  particularly with respect to foreign investment activities and foreign trade 
enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain  and the implementation and interpretation of them may be inconsistent 
as the chinese legal system develops  the promulgation of new laws  changes to existing laws and the preemption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors and foreign companies with operations in china  such as ours 
in addition  some government policies and rules are not published or communicated in local districts in a timely manner  if at all 
if they are published  they may not be followed consistently by local districts 
as a result  we may inadvertently operate our business in violation of new rules and policies without having any knowledge of their existence 
these uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us 
any litigation or other proceeding in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
furthermore  a significant portion of our business in china involves contracts with government bodies  which can significantly inhibit our ability to enforce a contract through litigation or similar means 
circumstances could arise in which our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired  causing us to recognize substantial non cash impairment charges  which would adversely affect our financial results 
we have pursued and will continue to seek potential acquisitions to complement and expand our existing businesses  increase our revenues and profitability  and expand our markets 
as a result of prior acquisitions  we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets on an ongoing basis  and we may incur substantial non cash impairment charges  which would adversely affect our financial results 
there can be no assurance the outcome of such reviews in the future will not result in substantial impairment charges 
impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices  costs  holding periods or other factors resulting in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
a decline in our market capitalization or in our estimated forecasted discounted cash flows could also result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets 
a non cash impairment charge could materially and adversely affect the net income for the reporting period in which it is recorded 

table of contents the terms and conditions of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations  and if we default on our credit facility  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the terms and conditions of our credit facilities impose restrictions limiting  among other things  our ability to incur debt  merge  sell assets  make distributions including cash dividends and create or incur liens 
the availability of credit facilities is also subject to certain covenants as explained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure we will achieve operating results and maintain a financial position meeting the requirements of the credit facility 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the facilities 
in the event of a default  the bank could elect to declare any outstanding principal amount of the credit facilities and term debt  any and all accrued interest thereon and any or all other amounts payable under the credit facilities to be immediately due and payable  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of april   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants of our credit facilities 
maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers 
these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if a bond is required for a particular project  and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond  we cannot pursue that project 
historically  we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity  however  as is typically the case  the issuance of a bond is at the surety sole discretion and the issuance of the letter of credit is based on the company credit worthiness 
prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors could impair our ability to operate our business  satisfy our debt obligations  and impact our customers and vendors business 
it is anticipated borrowings from our existing credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities should provide sufficient funds to finance our capital expenditures  working capital and otherwise meet operating expenses and debt service requirements as they become due 
however  if additional capital is required  there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  market conditions can negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects and can impact our vendors  suppliers  and subcontractors and may not allow them to perform their obligations to us  potentially impacting our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may make future acquisitions  which may be difficult to integrate  divert management resources  result in unanticipated costs or dilute our shareholders 
part of our business strategy is to acquire or invest in companies  businesses  products or technologies complementing our current products  enhancing our market coverage or technical capabilities  or offer growth opportunities 
we currently do not have any definitive agreements to acquire any company or business  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
additional risks potentially associated with acquisitions include the following difficulty integrating the purchased company  products  businesses or technologies into our own business incurring substantial unanticipated integration costs difficult  time consuming and costly to integrate management information and accounting systems of an acquired business into our current systems assimilating the acquired businesses may divert management attention and financial resources from our other operations  disrupting our ongoing business entering markets in which we have limited prior experience loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired entity retaining or developing the acquired businesses customers adversely affect our existing business relationships with suppliers failure to effectively analyze our return on investment inability to indemnify assumed liabilities for infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims in connection with these acquisitions or investments  we could incur debt  recognize amortization expenses related to intangible assets  recognize large and immediate write offs  assume liabilities or issue stock diluting our current shareholders percentage of ownership 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations  products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we maintain inventory subject to obsolescence and write downs to the extent it is replaced through product enhancements or advances in technology 
as a result of our products being subject to continuous enhancements and design changes  inventory held by us is subject to the risk of obsolescence  and excess levels may not be salable 
losses incurred as a result could have an adverse impact on our future profits 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights we use in our products and services 
we may not be able to successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future  and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services have been or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect proprietary 
table of contents information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  even if we are successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves against a claim of infringement  any related dispute or litigation could be costly and time consuming thereby diverting management s attention from business 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights  which could be costly  time consuming and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
as the sizes of our markets increase and our product offerings continue to evolve and become more sophisticated  we are more likely to be subject to claims our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties 
given the current legal framework associated with infringement claims  any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive and could divert our management s attention away from the execution of our business plan 
moreover  any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts  obtain a license to continue to use the technology subject to the claim  or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology 
there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain a license from the third party asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms if at all  we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis if at all or we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering  and our customers to continue using  our affected product 
in addition  we may be required to indemnify our customers partners for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling in such a claim 
an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products to others 
infringement claims asserted against us or our vendors may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation can have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we can be a party to litigation in the normal course of business 
litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings can and do occur 
pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability  product liability  criminal liability  warranty obligations or other liabilities to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurance fails to provide adequate coverage and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our manufacturing would be interrupted if we were unable to use one of our manufacturing facilities 
we manufacture most of our products in two locations in south dakota and one in minnesota 
in addition  we manufacture certain products in our china facility 
if any of these facilities  or a part thereof  were to be destroyed  shut down or unable to be used for its intended purposes  we would be limited in our capacity to meet customer demands until a replacement facility and equipment  if necessary  was found 
the replacement of the manufacturing facility could take an extended amount of time before manufacturing operations could restart 
the delay engendered by  and the potential cost incurred in  these steps could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our data systems could fail or their security could be compromised 
our business operations depend on the reliability of sophisticated data systems 
any failure of these systems  or any breach of our systems security measures  could adversely affect our operations  at least until our data can be restored and or the breaches remediated 
our common stock has at times been thinly traded  which may result in low liquidity and price volatility 
the daily trading volume of our common stock has at times been relatively low 
if this were to occur in the future  the liquidity and appreciation of our common stock may not meet shareholders expectations  and the prices at which our stock trades may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted as a result of sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or by the perception such sales could occur 
the protections we have adopted and to which we are subject may discourage takeover offers favored by our shareholders 
we have adopted and are subject to several provisions of the south dakota business corporation act sd act which could have the effect of discouraging takeover offers 
of the  shares of capital stock authorized in our articles of incorporation   shares are undesignated 
our board of directors may issue the undesignated shares on terms and with the rights  preferences and designations determined by the board without shareholder action  which could be used to discourage takeover attempts 
our articles of incorporation provide for a classified board consisting of three classes of directors 
our classified board generally makes it more difficult to replace directors and to acquire our company 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the exercise of preferred share purchase rights when a person becomes the beneficial owner of percent or more of our outstanding common stock subject to certain exceptions 
in addition  we are governed by the anti takeover provisions of the current sd act  which may deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock  which in turn have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock 
in general  shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition  as defined in the sd act  have no voting rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner 
there are also provisions prohibiting a public south dakota corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder  as defined in the sd act  for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the sd act also limits the voting rights of shares acquired in specified types of acquisitions and restricts specified types of business combinations 
the existence or issuance of blank check stock  the classified board  the existence of our shareholder rights plan and the effect of the anti takeover provisions of 
table of contents the sd act  individually or in the aggregate  may discourage potential takeover attempts and delay  deter or prevent a change in control 
they also may make the removal of management more difficult  which could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares at prices higher than prevailing market prices 
significant changes in the market price of our common stock could result in securities litigation claims against us 
significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of technology companies generally 
the price of our common stock has changed significantly in the past and is likely to continue to experience significant changes in the future 
in the past  securities litigation claims have been filed against certain companies following a period of decline in the market price of their publicly traded securities 
we may be the target of similar securities litigation claims in the future 
risks associated with litigation often are difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time 
although we maintain directors and officers insurance  the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim  and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured 
future litigation  if any  may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and the liquidity of our common stock 
our directors and executive officers have substantial influence over us and could limit the ability of our other shareholders to affect the outcome of key transactions  including changes of control

these shareholders may have interests differing from other shareholders and they may vote in a way with which other shareholders disagree  unfavorably affecting other shareholders interests 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change of control of our company  could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company  and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership of our common stock may also have the effect of influencing the completion of a change in control not necessarily in the best interests of all of our shareholders 
our business is partially subject to risks of terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war 
terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  may disrupt our operations as well as the operations of our customers 
such acts have created an interruption of orders and delays in orders already booked  primarily in sports facilities and destination sites 
any future terrorist activities and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  could create additional uncertainties  forcing customers to further reduce or delay their spending or cancel or delay already planned projects  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a wide range of display systems to customers throughout the world 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on markets  geographical regions and products 
our five business segments consist of four domestic business units and an international business unit 
the four domestic business units consist of live events  commercial  schools and theatres  and transportation  which include the geographic territories of the united states and canada 
our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large project orders  such as display systems for professional sports facilities and colleges and universities or spectacular projects in the commercial area  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
large project orders can include a number of displays  controllers  and subcontracted structure builds all of which can occur on variable schedule according to the customer needs 
net sales and gross profit percentages also have fluctuated due to other seasonal factors  including the impact of holidays  which primarily affects our third quarter 
our gross margins on large custom and standard orders tend to fluctuate more than small standard orders 
large product orders involving competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for large custom orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
orders are booked and included in backlog only upon receipt of a firm contract and after receipt of any required deposits 
as a result  certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be booked until all required contractual documents and deposits are received 
in addition  order bookings can vary significantly on a quarterly basis as a result of the timing of large orders 

table of contents general our business  especially the large video display business in all of our business units  is very competitive  and generally our margins on these large contracts are similar across the business units over the long term 
there are  however  differences in the short term among the business units  which are discussed more fully in the following analysis 
overall  our business growth is driven by the market demand for large format electronic displays with the depth and quality of our products  including related control systems  and the depth of our service offerings and our technology serving these market demands 
this growth  however  is partially offset by declines in product prices caused by increasing competition 
each business unit also has unique key growth drivers 
commercial business unit over the long term  we believe growth in the commercial business unit will result from a number of factors  including the growing interest in our standard display products used in many different retail type establishments  among other types of applications 
the demand in this area is driven by retailers and other types of commercial establishments desire to attract the attention of motorists and others into their storefronts 
it is also driven by the need to communicate messages to the public 
national accounts may replace their displays reaching end of life  which could lead to increased sales 
furthermore  we believe in the future there will be increased demand from national accounts  including retailers  quick serve restaurants and other types of nationwide organizations  which could lead to increasing sales 
increasing interest in spectaculars  which include very large and sometimes highly customized displays as part of entertainment venues such as casinos  amusement parks and times square type locations 
the introduction of architectural lighting products for commercial buildings  which real estate owners use to add accents or effects to an entire side or circumference of a building to communicate messages or to decorate the building 
the continued deployment of digital billboards as billboard companies continue developing new sites for these and start to replace digital billboards which are reaching end of life 
this is dependent on there being no adverse changes in the digital billboard regulatory environment  which could restrict future deployments of billboards  as well as maintaining our current market share of the business concentrated in a few large billboard companies 
live events business unit over the long term  we believe growth in the live events business unit will result from a number of factors  including facilities spending more on larger display systems lower product costs  which are driving an expansion of the marketplace our product and service offerings  which remain the most integrated and comprehensive offerings in the industry the competitive nature of sports teams  which strive to out perform their competitors with display systems the desire for high definition video displays  which typically drives larger displays or higher resolution displays  both of which increase the average transaction size schools and theatres business unit over the long term  we believe growth in the schools and theatres business unit will result from a number of factors  including increased demand for video systems in high schools as school districts realize the revenue generating potential of these displays versus traditional scoreboards increased demand for different types of displays  such as message centers at schools to communicate to students  parents and the broader community the use of more sophisticated displays in more athletic venues  such as aquatics in schools transportation business unit over the long term  we believe growth in the transportation business unit will result from increasing applications of electronic displays to manage transportation systems  including roadway  airport  parking  transit and other applications 
this growth is highly dependent on government spending  primarily by the federal government 
international business unit over the long term  we believe growth in the international business unit will result from achieving greater penetration in various geographies  building products more suited to individual markets  third party advertising market opportunities  and the reasons listed in each of the other business units to the extent they apply outside the united states and canada 
each of our business units is impacted by adverse economic conditions in different ways and to different degrees 
the effects of an adverse economy are generally less severe on our sports related business as compared to our other businesses  although in severe economic downturns  the sports business also can be severely impacted 
our commercial and international business units are highly dependent on economic conditions in general 

table of contents the cost and selling prices of our products have decreased over time and are expected to continue to decrease in the future 
as a result  each year we must sell more products to generate the same or greater level of net sales as in previous fiscal years 
this price decline has been significant as a result of increased competition across all business units 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to total costs on long term construction type contracts  costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  share based compensation and contingencies 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term construction type contracts 
earnings on construction type contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
indirect costs include charges for such items as facilities  engineering and project management 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are capable of being estimated 
generally  construction type contracts we enter into have fixed prices established  and to the extent the actual costs to complete construction type contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively affected in future quarters when we revise our estimates 
our practice is to revise estimates as soon as such changes in estimates are known 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions we use to determine these estimates 
we combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective  essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a customer  involve interrelated construction activities  and are performed concurrently or sequentially 
when a group of contracts is combined  revenue and profit are recognized uniformly over the performance of the combined projects 
we segment revenues in accordance with the contract segmenting criteria in accounting standards codification asc  construction type and production type contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to identify impairment in customers ability to pay  we review aging reports  contact customers in connection with collection efforts and review other available information 
although we consider our allowance for doubtful accounts adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of april  and april   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts balance of approximately million and million  respectively 
warranties 
we have recognized a reserve for warranties on our products equal to our estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with our performance under the warranties 
generally  estimates are based on historical experience taking into account known or expected changes 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated warranty costs  additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine our reserve for warranties 
as of april  and april   we had approximately million and million reserved for these costs  respectively 
extended warranty and product maintenance 
we recognize deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements 
the deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated costs under these agreements in excess of our deferred revenue  additional reserves may be necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
in determining if additional reserves are necessary  we examine cost trends on the contracts and other information and compare them to the deferred revenue 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine estimated costs under these agreements 
as of april  and april   we had million and million of deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements  respectively 

table of contents inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market refers to the current replacement cost  except market may not exceed the net realizable value that is  the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal  and market is not less than the net realizable value reduced by an allowance for normal profit margins 
in valuing inventory  we estimate market value where it is believed to be the lower of cost or market  and any necessary changes are charged to costs of goods sold in the period in which they occur 
in determining market value  we review various factors such as current inventory levels  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the estimated market value of inventory 
however  if market conditions change  including changes in technology  product components used in our products or in expected sales  we may be exposed to unforeseen losses which could be material 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense  as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in each jurisdiction  and to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
we review deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  and to the extent we believe the asset may not be realized  we recognize a valuation allowance 
if our estimates of future taxable income are not met in future periods  a valuation allowance for some of these deferred tax assets may be required 
we believe we will generate taxable income in future years which will allow for realization of deferred tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets would require approximately million of taxable income  which we believe is achievable through the carry back of losses or future earnings 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions  both domestic and international  and are subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  including challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amounts to various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we record our income tax provision based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including the existing tax laws  the status of any current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
in evaluating the exposure associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures consistent with asc  income taxes 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve  when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information becomes available 
our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposure associated with our various filing positions 
we believe any potential tax assessments from various tax authorities not covered by our income tax provision will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
some of the countries in which we are located allow tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available and practicable 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives were retracted for past periods which in some cases could occur if we do not satisfy the conditions on which such holidays or incentives are based  they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
our tax holiday with respect to our chinese operations expired as of december   and after fiscal  we were not benefiting from any tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions which would have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
in addition  any acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase  depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located 
asset impairment 
carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
our impairment review involves estimating the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income discounted cash flow approach at the reporting unit level  requiring significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge 
we use our judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
indicators such as adverse business conditions  economic factors and technological change or competitive activities may signal an asset has become impaired 
carrying values for long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment reviews are conducted when we believe a change in circumstances in the business or external factors warrants a review 
circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line  a sudden or consistent decline in the forecast for a product  changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used  a history of negative operating cash flow  or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  among others  may be indicators to trigger an impairment review 
the company s initial 
table of contents impairment review to determine if a potential impairment charge is required is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the analysis requires judgment with respect to changes in technology  the continued success of product lines  future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and discount rates 
share based compensation 
we use the black scholes standard option pricing model black scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights 
the determination of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding other variables  including projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  expected volatility of our stock price in future periods  and expected dividend yield 
we analyze historical employee exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption of a new employee option 
we believe historical data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option 
the risk free interest rate we use is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock price in future periods by using the implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use expected volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options for our common stock  and our assessment of expected volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than the historical volatility of our common stock 
we use an expected dividend yield consistent with our dividend yield over the period of time we have paid dividends in the black scholes option valuation model 
the amount of share based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data  and we revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net earnings and net earnings per share in a future period

table of contents fiscal year as compared to fiscal year commercial the decrease in net sales for fiscal compared to the same period one year ago was the net result of a decrease of million in sales for large video display projects due to delayed orders for custom video projects 
a decrease of million in sales to outdoor advertising companies due to lower demand from our billboard customers 
an increase of million in sales of on premise advertising displays  which was primarily due to an increase in orders for a national account customer replacement program  as previously disclosed  and an improved economy 
an increase of million of service related sales 
over the near term in fiscal  we believe the commercial market sales will be generally flat due indications given to us by our billboard customers and expected lower national account replacements compared to fiscal a number of custom video projects opportunities are available in the marketplace  however  due to a number of factors  such as the discretionary nature of customers committing to the system  it is difficult to predict orders and sales for fiscal live events the decrease in net sales for fiscal compared to the same period one year ago was the net result of a million decrease in sales to mobile and modular customers due to reduced demand from these customers 
general volatility of this business unit because of the nature of the business in large custom display systems 
during fiscal  sales increased for multi purpose live event arena venues and national football league stadiums which were offset by a decrease in sales to national baseball league stadiums and national hockey league and national basketball association arenas 
we continue to see ongoing interest from venues at all levels to increase the size and capability of their display system which should offer continued growth opportunity for this market in fiscal a number of factors  such as the discretionary nature of customers committing to upgrade systems  versus the non discretionary purchases associated with new construction  the current aggressive competitive environment and various other factors  make forecasting fiscal orders and net sales difficult 
however  for the reasons cited previously  we expect growth in this business unit over the long term  assuming the economy continues to improve and we are successful at counteracting competitive pressures 
schools and theatres the increase in net sales for fiscal compared to the same period one year ago was the result of schools demonstrating more willingness this year than in fiscal to move forward with projects including smaller video systems  scoring and timing equipment and message centers 
an increased demand in video projects for high schools 
we continue to see opportunities to sell larger video systems  primarily in high school facilities which benefit from our sports marketing services that generate advertising revenue to fund the display systems for fiscal for the long term  we believe this business unit presents growth opportunities as the economy continues to improve 
transportation the increase in net sales for fiscal compared to the same period one year ago was the result of sales recorded from a large procurement contract compared to the previous year 
sales recorded in relation to a million order for video displays at the lax bradley international terminal in los angeles 
this type of order in the transportation market is unusual and infrequent in nature 
during fiscal  we recorded significant revenues from large projects in excess of million related to the lax and new jersey turnpike authority projects 
currently we do not have another large project like these on the horizon for fiscal to replace these sales  but with the introduction of our mm high resolution full color products introduced in fiscal  we are anticipating sales to adjust back to a more normal growth curve with an increase over fiscal sales levels 
international the increase in net sales for the fiscal compared to the same period one year ago was the net result of general volatility of this business unit because of the nature of the business in large custom display systems and timing differences in the production and installation schedule of orders booked 
for fiscal  we believe the international business unit to have potential for sales growth as we penetrate markets with our established sales networks 
in addition  the third party advertising business continues to be strong worldwide and we see a definite shift to digital as price for displays has come down 
both of these factors could increase sales 

table of contents fiscal year as compared to fiscal year commercial the increase in net sales in our commercial business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the net result of an increase in orders of approximately percent in our billboard business 
this growth was the result of the large outdoor advertising companies increasing their rollout of digital billboards beginning in calendar and our ability to gain back a portion of the business with one large outdoor advertising company 
an increase of approximately percent in orders for large video display systems  primarily spectaculars  which we attribute to improvements in the economy and a growing market 
a percent increase in orders for our standard product displays  which appears to be a reflection of improvement in the economy as well as our expanded product offerings  including our galaxypro line of displays 
live events net sales were generally flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  orders and net sales were impacted by a decrease in orders and net sales for professional baseball facilities 
during fiscal  we booked approximately million in orders for professional baseball projects compared to approximately million in fiscal net sales in professional baseball facilities were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
these changes were the result of higher than expected orders in fiscal that were delayed from fiscal as a result of economic conditions  which drove to unusually high levels 
a decrease in orders and net sales for professional football and basketball facilities 
during fiscal  we booked approximately million in orders for professional football and basketball projects  compared to approximately million in fiscal net sales were million and million for fiscal and this change was the result of labor issues in both sports in the spring and summer of calendar year an increase in orders for colleges and universities which more than offset the declines mentioned above 
this increase was the result of the factors driving growth in the live events business unit as described previously 
schools and theatres the decrease in net sales in our schools and theatres business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of economic pressures on schools  which we believe inhibits spending in spite of the revenue generation abilities of these display systems for schools 
transportation the increase in net sales in our transportation business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of the increase in orders booked during this period  which was driven by orders from the new jersey turnpike authority under a million  three year procurement contract 
net sales from this customer exceeded million for fiscal international the increase in net sales in our international business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of the higher backlog of business we had at the beginning of fiscal  primarily as a result of a large contract for a new arena built in mexico during fiscal at the end of fiscal  the backlog of this contract was approximately million compared to zero at the end of fiscal advertising revenues we occasionally sell products in exchange for the advertising revenues generated from the use of our display products 
these sales represented less than one percent of net sales for fiscal  and the gross profit percent on these transactions has typically been higher than the gross profit percent on other transactions of similar size  although the selling expenses associated with these transactions are typically higher 
backlog the product order backlog as of april  was approximately million as compared to million as of april  historically  our backlog varies due to the timing of large projects and customer delivery schedules for these projects 
the backlog decreased from one year ago in our live events and schools and theatres business units and increased in our other business units 
backlog is not a measure defined by us generally accepted accounting principles  and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts 
our backlog is equal to the amount of net sales expected to be recognized in future periods on standard product and contract sales that are evidenced by an arrangement  with prices that are fixed and determinable and with collectability reasonably assured 
backlog may not be indicative of future operating results  and arrangements in our backlog may be canceled  modified or otherwise altered  therefore  it is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income

a decrease of approximately percentage points because of unexpected warranty costs and costs incurred for services not covered under warranty to cover primarily supplier component issues 
for fiscal  warranty costs were approximately percent of net sales compared to percent in fiscal it is difficult to project gross profit levels for fiscal because of the uncertainty regarding the level of sales and the competitive factors in our business 
we expect gross profit levels will increase as we continue to execute on our strategies for improved profitability 
we plan on focusing efforts on the quality of suppliers  adding additional quality testing in our manufacturing areas  continuing our sourcing strategies  continuing focus on product reliability in designs to improve warranty costs as a percent of sales and improved process flow in our manufacturing and services organization to improve gross profit margin 
an increase in gross profit assumes competitive pressures remain consistent with the levels of fiscal commercial the gross profit percent increase for fiscal compared to the same period one year ago was primarily the result of sales mix and improved manufacturing utilization  which were offset by unexpected warranty costs due to a supplier component failure

a decrease in gross profit percentage on services and maintenance agreements  which caused a decrease of approximately percentage points

product development investments during fiscal included video technology with a range of pixel pitches for outdoor applications using led surface mount technology 
in addition  we completed development of a new full color family of vanguard displays for the transportation business unit 
our costs for product development represent an allocated amount of costs based on time charges  materials costs and overhead of our engineering departments 
generally  a significant portion of our engineering time is spent on product development  while the rest is allocated to large contract work and included in cost of goods sold

interest expense is comprised primarily of interest costs on long term marketing obligations 
interest income declined slightly for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a reduction in long term receivable balances 
as a result of the volatility of working capital needs and changes in investing and financing activities  along with changes in the interest rate environment  it is difficult to project changes in interest income 
we expect our cash balances will be increasing during fiscal  however  we are unable to project how that will compare to fiscal other expense income  net the decrease of million in other expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to a settlement of a dispute relating to a past acquisition of million and approximately million of higher currency losses on us dollar advances to foreign subsidiaries in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income  net interest income declined slightly for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a reduction in our cash and short term investment balances that was mainly the result of dividends paid during fiscal interest expense increased to million for fiscal as a result of borrowings in china to support our expanding business there and the impact of currency controls  which limit our transfers of investment capital from the us to fund operations in china

fiscal year fourth quarter summary during the fourth quarter of fiscal  net sales increased approximately percent to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales increased in all business units except for live events 
the increase in net sales for the international business unit was due to net sales realized on large projects including an architectural lighting project and a video display project for a horse race track  and on deliveries of other orders booked prior to the quarter 
commercial business unit net sales increased due to the net sales realization on large video projects offset by decreases in net sales for our billboard niche which was caused by variability in timing of orders being booked and softening of demand 
transportation business unit net sales increased due to the continued net sales realization of a project for a major airport 
schools and theatres business unit net sales increased due the increased delivery on video projects for high schools  for which our customers have shown strong demand for 
gross margin percentage increased to approximately percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal from approximately percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in gross profit percentage was the net result of unexpected warranty charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  accounting for an approximately three percentage points decline 
several large projects generating revenue having lower than typical margins due to the competitive pricing on projects  primarily in the live events business unit 
improved gross margins in our schools theatres business unit because of sales mix and a decline in warranty charges 
improvements in the overall cost and resource management in manufacturing infrastructure 
selling expenses decreased from million to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease was the net result of a decrease of approximately million in third party commissions primarily in the international business unit

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  various impairments of capital assets of approximately million were recorded related to the redesign of our outdoor surface mount product platform video display modules 
the effective tax benefit was percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to a benefit of percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease was primarily related to one time adjustments booked in fiscal that were not repeated during the fourth quarter of fiscal  including the recognition of various tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions  the reversal of a valuation allowance relating to net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction  and an adjustment of state income tax estimates related to fiscal the effective tax benefit for the fourth quarter of fiscal was the result of an increase in the domestic production activities deduction estimate and other one time adjustments in fiscal liquidity and capital resources year ended april  april  percent change in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities the increase in cash from operating activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the net result of an increase in net income of million plus million from a reduction of changes in net operating assets and liabilities  adjusted by depreciation and amortization of million and by deferred income taxes of million 
the most significant drivers of the change in net operating assets and liabilities were the net result of the following a decrease in cash resulting from an increase in costs and earnings in excess of billings of million 
variability in costs and earnings in excess of billings relates to the timing of billings on construction type contracts and revenue recognition  which can vary significantly depending on contractual payment terms and build and installation schedules 
as of april   million of the increase related to four different transportation projects  timing difference mainly relates to timing of shipment and billings per progress payment schedule 
the majority of these unbilled amounts is expected to be billed during the first quarter of fiscal an increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million was the result of a million increase in payables related to a change in extended payments terms with one large supplier  a million increase in payables and accruals related to four large projects in process at year end  and a million increase in accrued items related to various marketing agreements on large projects and increases in various payroll related accruals

days inventory outstanding decreased from days as of april  to days as of april  changes in inventory are primarily the result of using inventory in production specified for a significant transportation project and inventory management initiatives 
a reduction of million in accounts receivable and long term receivables primarily due to the collection of two significant progress payments totaling million that were outstanding at the end of fiscal and the annual collection of long term receivables 
a net change in various other operating assets and liabilities  which increased cash from operations by million 

table of contents overall  changes in operating assets and liabilities can be impacted by the timing of cash flows on large projects  which can cause significant fluctuations in the short term in inventory  accounts receivables  accounts payable  customer deposits  costs and earnings in excess of billings and various other operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities the decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the net result of the following an increase in the net cash invested in marketable securities  net of maturities 
our investment approach has remained consistent year over year as we try to maintain a consistent level of marketable securities and  therefore  the change was the result of the timing of investment decisions and investments of excess cash in marketable securities 
a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of million 
the decrease relates primarily to the timing of projects anticipated  but not completed during fiscal for the expansion of our surface mount production line 
we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal during fiscal  we invested million in manufacturing equipment  million in product demonstration equipment  million in information systems infrastructure  including software  and million in other assets 
these investments were generally for maintenance in the case of information systems and in manufacturing investments related to a new product line for our outdoor surface mount displays and various other equipment 
as of the end of fiscal  capital expenditures were approximately two percent of net sales 
cash flows from financing activities the increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in dividends paid to shareholders as explained elsewhere in this report  which was partially offset by the net change in repayments of our short term debt obligations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
other liquidity and capital resource discussion included in receivables and costs in excess of billings as of april  was approximately million of retainage on long term contracts  all of which is expected to be collected within one year 
working capital was million at april  and million at april  the increase in working capital was primarily the result of higher sales and the net changes between accounts receivable  inventories and cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
we have historically financed working capital needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements 
we have used and expect to continue to use cash reserves and  to a lesser extent  bank borrowings to meet our short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and a customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
we have a credit agreement with a us bank providing for a million line of credit and includes up to million for standby letters of credit 
the line of credit is due on november  the interest rate ranges from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points depending on the ratio of our interest bearing debt to ebitda 
ebitda is defined as net income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization 
the effective interest rate was percent at april  we are assessed a loan fee equal to percent per annum of any non used portion of the loan 
as of april   there were no advances under the line of credit 
the credit agreement is unsecured and requires us to be in compliance with the following financial ratios a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to at the end of any fiscal year 
the ratio is equal to a ebitda less dividends  a capital expenditure reserve of million  and income tax expense  over b all principal and interest payments with respect to debt  excluding debt outstanding on the line of credit  and a ratio of interest bearing debt  excluding any marketing obligations  to ebitda of less than to at the end of any fiscal quarter 
we have an additional credit agreement with another us bank which expires on november  and is intended to support our credit needs outside of the united states 
the facility provides for a million line of credit and includes facilities for letters of credit and bank guarantees and to secure foreign loans for our international subsidiaries 
the us credit agreement is unsecured and is cross collateralized with the million line of credit described above 
it contains the same covenants as the credit agreement above 
as of april   there were no advances under the line of credit 

table of contents we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of april  and april  the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of april  was to  and the ratio of interest bearing debt to ebitda as of april  was to on may   our board of directors declared a semi annual dividend of per share on our common stock for the fiscal year ended april   payable on june  although we expect to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future  any and all subsequent dividends will be reviewed regularly and declared by the board at its discretion 
we are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations  and we have a bonding line available through a surety company that provides for an aggregate of million in bonded work outstanding 
at april   we had million of bonded work outstanding against this line 
we believe if our growth extends beyond current expectations  or if we make any strategic investments  we may need to increase our credit facilities or seek other means of financing 
we anticipate we will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from our current lenders or other sources 
we believe our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we enter into various lease  purchase and marketing obligations that require payments in future periods 
operating lease obligations relate primarily to leased manufacturing space  office space  furniture  and vehicles 
long term marketing obligations relate to amounts due in future periods for payments on net sales where we sold and installed our equipment in exchange for future advertising revenue 
when certain advertising revenue thresholds are met  all or a portion of excess cash is owed back to the customer 
conditional and unconditional purchase obligations represent future payments for inventory  advertising rights and various other products and services purchase commitments 
we have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions relating to the guarantee of future performance on contracts  primarily construction type contracts 
performance guarantees are issued to certain customers to guarantee the operation and installation of the equipment and our ability to complete a contract 
these performance guarantees have various terms  which are generally less than one year 
guarantees include transactions in connection with the sale of equipment to various customers 
under these transactions  we entered into a contractual arrangement whereby we agreed to repurchase equipment at the end of the lease term at a fixed price of approximately million 
we have recognized a guarantee in the amount of million under the provisions of asc  guarantees 
as of april   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years cash commitments long term marketing obligations and accrued interest operating leases unconditional purchase obligations conditional purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions 
as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  the related balances have not been reflected in any of the columns other than the total column 
inflation we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or our financial condition  although it could in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through april   most of our net sales were denominated in united states dollars  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes on net sales has not been significant 
net sales originating from manufacturing plants and sales offices outside the united states were approximately percent of total net sales  of which a portion was denominated in canadian dollars  euros  chinese renminbi  british pounds  australian dollars  brazilian reais or other currencies 
we manufacture our products in the united states and china 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
if we believed currency risk in any foreign location was significant  we would utilize foreign exchange hedging contracts to manage our exposure to the currency fluctuations 
over the long term  net sales to international markets are expected to increase as a percentage of net sales and  consequently  a greater portion of this business could be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  we may fund our foreign subsidiaries operating cash needs in the form of loans denominated in us dollars 
as a result  operating results may become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
to the extent we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
this effect is also impacted by the sources of raw materials from international sources 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  if there were to be a ten percent change in value of the us dollar in relation to our foreign currency exposures  we would have had an impact of million on income before taxes 
we will continue to monitor and minimize our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques  including foreign currency forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures and other rules and regulations could adversely affect our ability to effectively hedge exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
we have foreign currency forward agreements in place to offset changes in the value of intercompany receivables from certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the notional amount of these derivatives is million and all contracts mature within twelve months 
these contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details on our derivatives 
interest rate risks our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our marketing obligations and long term accounts receivable 
as of april   our outstanding marketing obligations were million  substantially all of which were in fixed rate obligations 
in connection with the sale of certain display systems  we have entered into various types of financing with customers 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element 
the majority of these financings carry fixed rates of interest 
as of april   our outstanding long term receivables were million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of million 
the following table provides maturities and weighted average interest rates on our financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates 
fiscal years in thousands thereafter assets long term receivables  including current maturities fixed rate average interest rate liabilities long term marketing obligations  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate 
table of contents of our cash balances at april   million were denominated in united states dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies are operating balances maintained in accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
a portion of the cash held in foreign accounts is used to collateralize outstanding bank guarantees issued by the foreign subsidiaries
