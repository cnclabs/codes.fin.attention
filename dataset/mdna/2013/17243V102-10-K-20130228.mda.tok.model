table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements 
overview we are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry  with theatres in the us  brazil  mexico  argentina  chile  colombia  ecuador  peru  honduras  el salvador  nicaragua  costa rica  panama and guatemala 
as of december   we managed our business under two reportable operating segments us markets and international markets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues and expenses we generate revenues primarily from box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams  such as vendor marketing promotions  meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres 
our contracts with ncm have assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources such as digital video monitor advertising  third party branding  and the use of our domestic theatres for alternative entertainment  such as live and pre recorded sports programs  concert events  the opera and other special presentations 
films leading the box office during the year ended december  included the avengers  the dark knight rises  the hunger games  skyfall  the twilight saga breaking dawn part  the hobbit an unexpected journey  dr 
suess the lorax  madagascar europe s most wanted  men in black  taken  snow white and the huntsman  safe house  the vow  brave  prometheus  the amazing spider man  ice age continental drift and the bourne legacy  among other films 
our revenues are affected by changes in attendance and concession revenues per patron 
attendance is primarily affected by the quality and quantity of films released by motion picture studios 
films currently scheduled for release in include sequels such as the hunger games catching fire  the hobbit the desolation of smaug  iron man  the hangover  monsters university  despicable me  fast furious and a good day to die hard and original titles such as man of steel  oz the great and powerful  oblivion  pacific rim  lone ranger and world war z  among other films 
film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues 
film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released 
film rental costs can also vary based on the length of a film s run 
film rental rates are generally negotiated on a film by film and theatre by theatre basis 
advertising costs  which are expensed as incurred  are primarily fixed at the theatre level as daily movie directories placed in newspapers represent the largest component of advertising costs 
the monthly cost of these advertisements is based on  among other things  the size of the directory and the frequency and size of the newspaper s circulation 
concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues 
we purchase concession supplies to replace units sold 
we negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates 
although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component ie the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non peak periods  salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance 
facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment 
certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved 
facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases  the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee owned theatres 

table of contents utilities and other costs include certain costs that have both fixed and variable components such as utilities  property taxes  janitorial costs  repairs and maintenance and security services 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies  which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results  include the following revenue and expense recognition revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office 
other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising 
screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on screen or in theatre 
we record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate 
we recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates  based on historical experience  the likelihood of redemption is remote  and based on applicable laws and regulations 
in evaluating the likelihood of redemption  we consider the period outstanding  the level and frequency of activity  and the period of inactivity 
film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula  which are generally established prior to the opening of the film  or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement  which occurs at the conclusion of the film run  subject to the film licensing arrangement 
under a firm terms formula  we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts  which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run 
under a sliding scale formula  we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film 
the settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs 
estimates are based on the expected success of a film 
the success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known 
accordingly  final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run 
if actual settlements are different than those estimates  film rental costs are adjusted at that time 
our advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment 
certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only  which is accrued each month based on actual revenues 
certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved 
percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached 
once annual revenues are known  which is generally at the end of the year  the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time 
we record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight line basis over the lease term 
theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
in estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment  we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets actual theatre level cash flows  future years budgeted theatre level cash flows  theatre property and equipment carrying values  amortizing intangible asset carrying values  the age of a recently built theatre  competitive theatres in the marketplace  the impact of recent ticket price changes  available lease renewal options  and other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis  which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
the impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life 
the remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period  which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and a period of approximately twenty years for fee owned properties 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long lived asset s carrying value  we then compare the carrying value of the asset group theatre with its estimated fair value 
when estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group theatre  the asset group theatre is written down to its estimated fair value 
significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value 
management s estimates  which fall under level of the us gaap fair value hierarchy as defined by fasb asc topic  are based on historical and projected operating performance  recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples 
fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows  which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during  and the long lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition  adverse changes in market demographics  or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value 
management considers the reporting unit to be each of our sixteen regions in the us and each of our eight international countries honduras  el salvador  nicaragua  costa rica  panama and guatemala are considered one reporting unit 
the evaluation is a two step approach requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment 
significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value 
management s estimates  which fall under level of the us gaap fair value hierarchy as defined by fasb asc topic  are based on historical and projected operating performance  recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples 
fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows  which was six and a half times for the evaluation performed during and seven and a half times for the evaluations performed during and as of december   the estimated fair value of goodwill for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by at least 

table of contents tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues  with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long term revenue forecasts 
management s estimates  which fall under level of the us gaap fair value hierarchy as defined by fasb asc topic  are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends 
as of december   the estimated fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 
income taxes we use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments 
the evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two step process 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in a change in a liability for income taxes payable or a change in an income tax refund receivable  a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both and 
we accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
accounting for investment in national cinemedia  llc and related agreements we have an investment in ncm 
ncm operates a digital in theatre network in the us for providing cinema advertising and non film events 
upon joining ncm  the company and ncm entered into an exhibitor services agreement  pursuant to which ncm provides advertising  promotion and event services to the company s theatres 
on february   national cinemedia  inc  or ncm inc  a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of ncm  completed an initial public offering of its common stock 
in connection with the ncm inc initial public offering  the company amended its operating agreement and the exhibitor services agreement  or esa  with ncm and received proceeds related to the modification of the esa and the company s sale of certain of its shares in ncm 
the esa modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior exhibitor services agreement  which obligated ncm to pay the company a percentage of revenue  to a monthly theatre access fee  which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the company by ncm 
the company recorded the proceeds related to the esa modification as deferred revenue  which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method 
as a result of the proceeds received as part of the ncm  inc initial public offering  the company had a negative basis in its original membership units in ncm referred to herein as its tranche investment 
the company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its tranche investment until ncm s future net earnings  less distributions received  surpass the amount of the excess distribution 
the company recognizes equity in earnings on its tranche investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from ncm 
the company believes that the accounting model provided by asc for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution 

table of contents pursuant to a common unit adjustment agreement dated as of february  between ncm  inc and cinemark  amc and regal  collectively referred to as its founding members  annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each founding member 
to account for the receipt of additional common units under the common unit adjustment agreement  the company follows the guidance in asc formerly eitf  accounting for subsequent investments in an investee after suspension of equity loss recognition by analogy  which also refers to aicpa technical practice aid  which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses  the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses 
the company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in national cinemedia 
the company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in national cinemedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses 
the company accounts for these additional common units referred to herein as its tranche investment as a separate investment than its tranche investment 
the common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the company s investment in ncm with an offset to deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the esa 
the tranche investment is accounted for following the equity method  with undistributed equity earnings related to its tranche investment included as a component of equity in income loss of affiliates and distributions received related to its tranche investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis 
recent developments dividend declaration on february   our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of of per common share payable to stockholders of record on march  the dividend will be paid on march  disposition of mexican subsidiaries during february  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with grupo cinemex  sa de sa pursuant to which we will sell our mexican subsidiaries  which consist of theatres and screens 
the sales price  which will be paid in mexican pesos and is subject to certain closing date adjustments  will be approximately million  based on the exchange rate on the date of this report 
the transaction  which is subject to review by the mexican federal competition commission  is expected to close during the second half of

table of contents as a result of the prepayment made in june  we wrote off approximately million in unamortized debt issue costs related to the unextended portion of term loan debt that was prepaid 
in addition  we determined that a portion of the quarterly interest payments hedged by two of our then current interest rate swap agreements under cash flow hedges and the quarterly interest payments related to our previously terminated interest rate swap agreement were probable not to occur and therefore reclassified approximately million of our accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these cash flow hedges to earnings  as a component of loss on early retirement of debt 
these write offs  combined with related fees  are reflected in loss on early retirement of debt for the year ended december  on december   the remaining outstanding term loan of million was paid in full with proceeds from the amended senior secured credit facility combined with a portion of the proceeds from the senior notes issuance  both of which are discussed above 
covenant compliance as of december   we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements  including all related covenants  governing our outstanding debt 
ratings we are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies 
the rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency 
credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity 
the credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency s evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company 
the credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency s judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company 
ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time 
a downgrade of our debt ratings  depending on the extent  could increase the cost to borrow funds

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  an amendment to fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asu 
the update provides an entity with the option first to assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
after assessing the qualitative factors  if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  the entity is not required to take further action 
if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption was permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our revenues have historically been seasonal  coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors 
generally  the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer  extending from may to mid august  and during the holiday season  extending from early november through year end 
the unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend 
the timing of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations  and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we are currently party to variable rate debt facilities 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt facilities 
at december   there was an aggregate of approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities  which excludes million of cinemark usa  inc s term loan debt that is hedged with the company s interest rate swap agreements as discussed below 
based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
all of our current interest rate swap agreements qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
the fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings 
below is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of december  nominal amount in millions effective date pay rate receive rate expiration date december month libor september december month libor september november month libor april 
table of contents the table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt agreements as of december  expected maturity for the twelve month periods ending december  in millions average interest rate thereafter total fair value fixed rate variable rate total debt includes million of the cinemark usa  inc term loan  which represents the debt currently hedged with the company s interest rate swap agreements 
includes the senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million  excluding the discount of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations 
generally  we export from the us certain of the equipment and construction interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries 
a majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country s local currency 
generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or us gaap  require that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency 
if our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy  us gaap requires that the us dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary 
currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains losses or foreign currency translation adjustments 
based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of december   holding everything else constant  a immediate  simultaneous  unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed  would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the years ended december   and by approximately million  million and million  respectively
