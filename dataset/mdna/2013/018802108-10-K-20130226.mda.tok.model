environmental matters overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to regulation of environmental matters by federal  state and local authorities as a result of their current and past operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl monitor these environmental matters and address them with emission abatement programs 
these programs are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to various factors  including changes in environmental regulations  litigation of environmental requirements  construction plans and compliance costs 
there is currently significant regulatory uncertainty with respect to the various environmental rules and regulations discussed below 
given the dynamic nature of environmental regulations and other related regulatory requirements  alliant energy  ipl and wpl have established an integrated planning process that is used for environmental compliance for their operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate future expenditures for environmental compliance will be material  including significant capital investments 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate that prudent expenditures incurred by ipl and wpl to comply with environmental requirements likely would be recovered in rates from ipl s and wpl s customers

the following are major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
air quality the clean air act caa and its amendments mandate preservation of air quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of these provisions based on scientific data 
as part of the basic framework under the caa  the epa is required to establish naaqs rules  which serve to protect public health and welfare 
these standards address six criteria pollutants  four of which nox  so  pm  and ozone are particularly relevant to alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s electric utility operations 
ozone is not directly emitted from alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s generating facilities  however  nox emissions may contribute to its formation in the atmosphere 
fine particulate matter pm may also be formed in the atmosphere from so and nox emissions 
state implementation plans sips document the collection of regulations that individual state agencies will apply to maintain naaqs rules and related caa requirements 
the epa must approve each sip and if a sip is not acceptable to the epa or if a state chooses not to issue separate state rules  then the epa can assume enforcement of the caa in that state by issuing a federal implementation plan 
routinely monitored locations that do not comply with naaqs rules may be classified by the 
table of contents epa as non attainment and require further actions to reduce emissions 
additional emissions standards may also be applied under the caa regulatory framework beyond naaqs rules 
the specific federal and state air quality regulations that may affect alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s operations are listed in the table below 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl also monitor various other potential environmental matters related to air quality  including litigation of various federal rules issued under the caa statutory authority  revisions to the new source review prevention of significant deterioration psd permitting programs and nsps  and proposed legislation or other regulatory actions to regulate the emission of ghg

ipl s and wpl s fossil fueled egus with greater than mw of capacity located in iowa  minnesota and wisconsin would have been impacted by csapr requirements 
in august  however  the dc circuit court vacated csapr  remanding it for further revision to the epa 
the dc circuit court order required the epa to continue administering cair pending the promulgation of a valid replacement for csapr 
in october  the epa  as well as several states  cities and other organizations  filed petitions for rehearing of the august decision that vacated csapr 
in january  the dc 
table of contents circuit court denied the epa s request for rehearing of the decision that vacated and remanded csapr for further revision 
petitioners may seek the supreme court s review of this decision  and during the interim  cair remains effective 
given that these rules remain subject to potential further reconsideration by the epa in response to legal challenges  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact on their financial condition or results of operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently believe that cair will be replaced in the future  either by a modified csapr or another rule that addresses the interstate transport of air pollutants  and expect that capital investments and or modifications to their egus to meet the final compliance requirements will be significant 
clean air visibility rule cavr cavr requires states to develop and implement plans to address visibility impairment in designated national parks and wilderness areas across the country with a national goal of no impairment by these implementation plans require best available retrofit technology bart emission controls and other additional measures needed for reducing state contributions to regional haze 
there are pending obligations under the epa s cavr to complete bart determinations that would evaluate control options to reduce these emissions at certain fossil fueled ipl and wpl egus that were under construction between and ipl s facilities that may be impacted include burlington unit  george neal units and  prairie creek unit  ml kapp unit and lansing unit wpl s facilities that may be impacted include edgewater unit  nelson dewey unit  and columbia units and in  the epa published a final rule that would allow bart obligations for so and nox emissions to be fulfilled by compliance with csapr 
in  the epa also approved cavr plans for iowa  wisconsin and minnesota  which would require compliance with csapr to fulfill bart requirements for so and nox emission reductions 
in august  the epa rule that allowed for cavr bart obligations to be met by csapr was challenged in the dc circuit court 
in october  parties also filed legal challenges to the epa s final approvals of iowa  wisconsin and minnesota cavr plans including the application of csapr to meet bart requirements at affected egus 
the dc circuit court has stayed action on these cases pending resolution of the legal challenges to csapr  which will determine if cavr is upheld or remanded for reconsideration 
it is unknown whether the epa will allow bart to be fulfilled by cair  a modified csapr or another rule pending the ongoing dc circuit court s review of these regulations and the epa s responses to resolve the court orders on these rules 
if the epa does not allow for bart to be fulfilled by cair  a modified csapr or another rule  then facility specific bart evaluations will be needed for each impacted unit to determine what emission controls must be installed to address visibility improvements 
in addition  there are uncertainties whether additional emission reductions could be required to address regional haze impacts beyond bart 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are unable to predict with certainty the impact that cavr might have on the operations of their existing egus until the legal challenges to cair and csapr are resolved 
utility mact rule in  the epa issued the final utility mact rule  also referred to as the mercury and air toxic standard 
the final rule requires compliance with emission limits for mercury  filterable pm as a substitute for non mercury metal haps and hydrogen chloride hcl as a substitute for acid gas haps 
the epa also proposed alternative standards for total or individual non mercury metals emissions instead of filterable pm and so emissions instead of hcl for acid gases if a scrubber is installed 
in addition  work practice standards were proposed for organic haps emissions to ensure proper combustion 
compliance is currently anticipated to be required by april however  an entity can request an additional year for compliance  which may be granted on a case by case basis by state permitting authorities for units that are needed to assure power reliability  units needed while building replacement generation or repowering to gas  or units that need additional time to install air emission controls technology 
in november  the epa issued a proposed reconsideration to limited aspects to the utility mact rule including revisions to the startup and shutdown provisions for existing egus 
the epa plans to issue a final reconsideration rule by march the final utility mact rule is subject to legal challenge that is pending in the dc circuit court 
given that this rule remains subject to legal challenge in the dc circuit court and possible revision due to the proposed reconsideration rule  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of the final utility mact rule on their financial condition and results of operations  but expect that capital investments and or modifications to their electric generating facilities could be significant to comply with the rule 
wisconsin state mercury rule the wisconsin state mercury rule requires electric utility companies in wisconsin to meet compliance requirements to reduce annual mercury emissions by from a historic baseline beginning in phase i 
in addition  this rule requires large coal fueled egus with greater than mw of capacity to either achieve a annual mercury emissions reduction standard or limit the annual concentration of mercury emissions to pounds of mercury per gigawatt hour beginning in phase ii 
small coal fueled egus between mw and mw of capacity must install best available control technology by january to reduce mercury emissions 
as an alternative  this rule allows large and small egus to achieve compliance through averaging of covered emissions 
in  wpl filed its compliance plan with the wisconsin department of natural resources dnr  which states wpl will utilize large and small egu averaging to comply with the additional mercury rule emission reduction requirements that commence in the 
table of contents issuance of the final utility mact rule is expected to initiate a review of  and may cause revisions to  the wisconsin state mercury rule 
alliant energy and wpl continue to evaluate the impact of this state mercury rule and the federal utility mact rule discussed above on their financial condition and results of operations to determine further mercury emission reductions that would be required 
wisconsin ract rule in  the epa designated counties in southeastern wisconsin as non attainment areas for the ozone naaqs 
this designation includes sheboygan county  where wpl operates the sheboygan falls energy facility and edgewater 
in  the wisconsin dnr issued a ract rule that requires nox emission reductions at egus as part of the federal ozone sip submittal to address non attainment areas in wisconsin 
facility modifications are not necessary at the sheboygan falls energy facility to comply with this rule 
as part of its environmental compliance plan  wpl completed investments for installation of nox emission controls technologies at edgewater  which met the to compliance requirements phase i

the rule is expected to apply to ipl s prairie creek boilers  and  and fossil fueled auxiliary boilers and process heaters operated at other ipl and wpl fossil fueled facilities 
the rule requires compliance with haps emission limitations and work practice standards 
the final rule remains subject to legal challenges in the dc circuit court 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently evaluating the final rule and plan to update their environmental compliance plans as needed 
given that this rule remains subject to legal challenges in the dc circuit court  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of the industrial boiler and process heater mact rule on their financial condition and results of operations  but expect that capital investments and or modifications to their electric generating facilities to meet compliance requirements of the rule could be significant 
ozone naaqs rule in  the epa announced reductions in the primary naaqs for eight hour ozone to a level of ppm from the previous standard of ppm 
in may  the epa issued a final rule that classifies sheboygan county in wisconsin as marginal non attainment  which requires this area to achieve the eight hour ozone naaqs by december wpl operates edgewater and the sheboygan falls energy facility in sheboygan county  wisconsin 
the final rule does not list any areas as ozone non attainment in iowa or minnesota that impact ipl 
another rule is currently expected to be issued by the epa in to assist state agencies in developing sips 
the sips will explain what actions and emission reductions may be required for compliance to achieve attainment 
the edgewater unit scr system completed in the fourth quarter of is expected to assist with possible compliance obligations under an ozone naaqs sip for wisconsin 
given the ozone naaqs remains subject to legal challenges in the dc circuit court and the wisconsin dnr has not yet issued an eight hour ozone non attainment sip  alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of the ozone naaqs changes for sheboygan county  wisconsin on their financial condition and results of operations 
fine particle naaqs rule in december  the epa issued a final rule revising the pm naaqs  which strengthens the annual standard from ug m to ug m the epa is expected to designate non attainment areas for the revised annual pm naaqs by december states with areas designated as non attainment will be required to submit pm naaqs sips within three years of the effective date of area designations by the epa 
the sips will explain what actions are needed in the non attainment areas to achieve compliance with annual pm naaqs

air permit renewal challenges alliant energy and wpl are aware of certain public comments or petitions from citizen groups that have been submitted to the wisconsin dnr or to the epa regarding the renewal of air operating permits at certain of wpl s generating facilities 
in some cases  the epa has responded to these comments and petitions with orders to the wisconsin dnr to reconsider the air operating permits of wpl s generating facilities 
wpl has received renewed air permits for columbia  edgewater and nelson dewey from the wisconsin dnr  which considered all public comments received as part of the renewal process 
below are recent developments regarding air permit renewal challenges for columbia  edgewater and nelson dewey 
columbia in  the sierra club filed a lawsuit against the epa in the us district court for the western district of wisconsin seeking to have the epa take over the title v air permit process for columbia 
the sierra club alleges the epa must now act on the reconsideration of the permit since the wisconsin dnr has exceeded its timeframe in which to respond to an epa order issued in in  the wisconsin dnr proposed a revised draft operation permit for columbia and wpl and the sierra club submitted comments objecting to its appropriateness 
in june  alliant energy received a notice from the epa of its proposal for wpl to apply for a federal part operation permit since the wisconsin dnr has not addressed the epa s objections to the title v operation permit issued by the wisconsin dnr to columbia 
alliant energy has until march  to comment on the epa s proposal 
if the epa decides to require the submittal of an operation permit  it would be due within six months of the epa s notice to alliant energy 
alliant energy and wpl believe the title v operation permit previously issued by the wisconsin dnr for columbia is still valid 
alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the outcome of this matter and the impact on their financial condition or results of operations 
edgewater in  wpl received a copy of a notice of intent to sue by the sierra club against the epa based on what the sierra club asserts is unreasonable delay in the epa performing its duties related to the reconsideration of the edgewater title v air permit 
specifically  the sierra club alleges that because the wisconsin dnr has exceeded its timeframe in which to respond to an earlier epa order  the epa must now act on the reconsideration of the permit 
in october  the wisconsin dnr made a revised proposed title v air permit for edgewater available for public comment 
wpl and sierra club submitted comments on the proposed permit revision 
alliant energy and wpl believe the previously issued air permit for edgewater is still valid 
alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the outcome of this matter and the impact on their financial condition and results of operations 
nelson dewey in september  the sierra club petitioned the epa and the wisconsin dnr to reopen a nelson dewey air permit 
the sierra club alleges that the nelson dewey air permit issued by the wisconsin dnr in should be corrected because certain modifications were made at the facility without complying with the psd program requirements 
in  wpl filed a response to the petition with the epa and the wisconsin dnr objecting to its claims and supporting the wisconsin dnr s issuance of the current permit 
no action on this petition has been taken by the epa or the wisconsin dnr 
alliant energy and wpl believe the previously issued air permit for nelson dewey is still valid

other air quality matters ipl  the epa  the state of iowa and the sierra club are in discussions regarding caa issues associated with ipl s iowa operations 
alliant energy and ipl believe that they are in compliance with the caa 
ipl is pursuing these discussions because ipl believes there is an opportunity to reach an agreement among the parties that avoids potential litigation and the long term planning and operational uncertainty associated with such litigation 
alliant energy and ipl believe that any agreement could contain terms similar to those seen in other epa caa settlements  including  among others  the installation of emission controls  the retirement or fuel switching of egus  compliance with specified emission rates and emission caps  beneficial environmental mitigation projects and penalties 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to predict with certainty the outcome of these discussions and the impact on their financial condition or results of operations 
water quality section b of federal clean water act the federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure that these structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life 
the second phase of this epa rule is generally referred to as section b

a final rule is expected to be issued by the epa in the schedule for compliance with this rule has not yet been finalized  however  compliance is currently expected to be required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of the epa s section b rule on their financial condition and results of operations 
wisconsin and iowa state thermal rules section a of the federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate thermal impacts from wastewater discharges of industrial facilities  including those from egus 
all ipl and wpl facilities are subject to these standards upon state promulgation  which become applicable upon their incorporation into a facility s wastewater discharge permit 
states have authority to establish standards for these discharges in order to minimize adverse environmental impacts to aquatic life 
in iowa and wisconsin  the iowa dnr and wisconsin dnr are required to regulate thermal impacts from wastewater discharges of industrial facilities in their respective states  including ipl and wpl facilities that discharge water into nearby rivers and streams 
compliance with the thermal rules will be evaluated on a case by case basis when wastewater discharge permits for ipl s and wpl s generating facilities are renewed 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to evaluate the thermal rule regulatory requirements and the compliance options available to meet the heat limitations for discharges from ipl s and wpl s egus 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are unable to predict with certainty the final requirements of these rules until wastewater discharge permits for impacted facilities are renewed

table of contents land and solid waste coal combustion residuals ccrs alliant energy  ipl and wpl are monitoring potential regulatory changes that may affect the rules for operation and maintenance of coal ash surface impoundments ash ponds and or landfills  in the wake of a structural failure in the containment berm of a coal ash surface impoundment at a site operated by an unrelated  third party utility 
in  ipl and wpl responded to information collection requests from the epa for data on coal ash surface impoundments at certain of their facilities 
the epa continues to evaluate the responses and has been conducting site assessments of utilities coal ash surface impoundments  including certain coal ash surface impoundments operated by ipl and wpl 
in  the epa issued a proposed rule seeking comment regarding two potential regulatory options for management of ccrs regulate as a special waste under the federal hazardous waste regulations when the ccr is destined for disposal  but continue to allow beneficial use applications of ccrs as a non hazardous material  or regulate as a non hazardous waste for all applications subject to new national standards 
these proposed regulations include additional requirements with significant impact for ccr management  beneficial use applications and disposal 
ipl and wpl have nine and four current or former coal generating facilities  respectively  with one or more existing coal ash surface impoundments at each location 
in addition  ipl and wpl each have two active ccr company owned landfills 
all of these ccr disposal units would be subject to the proposed rule currently anticipated to be finalized in the schedule for compliance with this rule has not yet been established 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of these information collection requests  site inspections  or potential regulations for the management of ccrs  but expect that capital investments  operating expenditures and or modifications to comply with ccr rules could be significant 
closed ash landfill sites in  ipl received communication from the iowa dnr regarding an evaluation of groundwater monitoring results for four of its closed ash landfills and a request to further evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at two of its closed landfills 
ipl has implemented a monitoring plan to evaluate the potential offsite groundwater impacts at the two closed landfills with the installation of additional groundwater monitoring wells and corresponding groundwater sampling and analysis

ghg emissions climate change continues to be assessed by policymakers including consideration of the appropriate actions to mitigate global warming 
there is continued debate regarding the public policy response that the us should adopt  involving both domestic actions and international efforts 
as discussed in greater detail below  the epa is responding to a court ruling that requires issuance of federal rules to reduce ghg emissions under the existing caa 
associated regulations to implement these federal ghg rules are also underway in iowa  wisconsin and minnesota 
given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future regulations regarding the control of ghg emissions  alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently cannot predict with certainty the financial impact of any future climate change regulations on their operations but believe the expenditures to comply with any new emissions regulations could be significant 
epa endangerment and cause or contribute findings in  the epa issued a final endangerment and cause or contribute findings for ghg under the caa with an effective date of january this final action includes two distinct findings regarding ghg emissions under the caa 
first  the current and projected concentrations of ghg emissions in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations 
this is referred to as the endangerment finding and includes the six key ghg emissions identified in the epa s mandatory ghg reporting rule 
second  the combined emissions of co  methane ch  nitrous oxide no  and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key ghg emissions and hence to the threat 
table of contents of climate change 
this is referred to as the cause or contribute finding 
in  the epa  under authority from the ghg endangerment and cause or contribute findings  also issued a final rule that regulates ghg emissions from motor vehicles as a pollutant under the caa 
these findings by the epa enable it to regulate ghg stationary sources  including electric utility operations and natural gas distribution operations 
in december  the dc circuit court denied a request by petitioners for rehearing of the decision that upheld the epa s ability to regulate ghg 
as a result  the epa s ghg regulations remain effective as well as the epa s ability to issue additional requirements to reduce ghg emissions 
petitioners may seek the supreme court s review of this decision 
epa nsps for ghg emissions from electric utilities the epa has announced that it will issue ghg standards for electric utilities as nsps for new and existing fossil fueled egus 
the epa entered a settlement agreement that required the issuance of proposed regulations for new and existing power plants by july and final regulations no later than may as discussed below  the epa did not meet these deadlines and final regulations are pending 
new egus in april  the epa published proposed nsps for ghg  including co emissions from new fossil fueled egus larger than mw not including simple cycle combustion turbines  with an output based emissions rate limitation of  pounds of co per mwh 
this emissions rate limitation is expected to be effective upon the epa s issuance of the final rule in the second quarter of the proposed nsps for new egus is expected to apply to ipl s proposed construction of an approximate mw natural gas fired combined cycle electric generating facility in marshalltown  iowa  which will be designed to achieve compliance with the proposed co emissions rate limitation 
existing egus the epa s issuance of proposed regulations for existing egus remains delayed but is anticipated by the end of for existing egus  the nsps issued by the epa is expected to include emission guidelines that states must use to develop plans for reducing egu ghg emissions 
the guidelines will be established based on demonstrated controls  ghg emission reductions  costs and expected timeframes for installation and compliance 
accordingly  the implications of the epa s nsps rule for ghg emissions from existing egus are highly uncertain  including the nature of required emission controls and compliance schedule for mandating reductions of ghgs 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the final outcome of this proposed standard  but expect that expenditures to comply with any regulations to reduce ghg emissions could be significant 
epa mandatory ghg reporting rule in  the final epa mandatory ghg reporting rule became effective 
the final rule does not require control of ghg emissions  rather it requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor and report emissions 
the epa anticipates that the data collected by this rule will improve the us government s ability to formulate a set of climate change policy options 
the ghg emissions covered by the final epa reporting rule include co  ch  no  sulfur hexafluoride  hfcs  perfluorocarbons and other fluorinated gases 
the primary ghg emitted from alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility operations is co from the combustion of fossil fuels at their larger egus 
emissions of ghg are reported at the facility level in carbon dioxide equivalent coe and include those facilities that emit  metric tons or more of coe annually 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to maintain and update their emissions monitoring methodologies and data collection procedures to capture all the ghg emissions data required for ongoing compliance with the epa s mandatory ghg reporting rule 
this rule is subject to a legal challenge that is pending in the dc circuit court 
annual emissions  in terms of total mass of coe  as reported to the epa for electric utility and natural gas distribution operations  were as follows in millions alliant energy ipl wpl tons metric tons tons metric tons tons metric tons coe emissions a a coe emissions reported to the epa represent all emissions from the facilities operated by ipl and wpl and do not reflect their share of co owned facilities operated by other companies

utility electric margins electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses 
management believes that electric margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues since electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses are generally passed through to customers  and therefore result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes in electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses 
electric margins and mwh sales for alliant energy were as follows revenues and costs dollars in millions mwhs sold mwhs in thousands a b a b residential commercial industrial retail subtotal sales for resale wholesale bulk power and other other total revenues sales electric production fuel expense energy purchases expense purchased electric capacity expense margins a reflects the change from to b reflects the change from to vs 
summary electric margins decreased million  or  primarily due to million of decreased revenues due to higher credits on iowa retail electric customers bills resulting from the electric tax benefit rider during compared to other decreases to electric margins included million of higher purchased electric capacity expenses at wpl related to the kewaunee ppa  million of higher purchased electric capacity expenses at ipl related to the daec ppa  million of revenues recognized in related to interim fuel rates collected in at wpl and lower weather normalized sales volumes at wpl 
the electric tax benefit rider resulted in million and million of credits on iowa retail electric customers bills during and  respectively 
ipl s electric tax benefit rider resulted in reductions in electric revenues that were offset by reductions in income tax expense for the years ended december  and these items were partially offset by million of higher revenues at ipl from changes in recovery of transmission costs related to the transmission rider implemented in  a million increase in electric margins from changes in the recovery of electric production fuel and energy purchases expenses at wpl  an estimated million increase in electric margins from changes in sales caused by weather conditions in alliant energy s service territories  million of so emission allowance charges at ipl in and an increase in weather normalized sales volumes at ipl 
the higher transmission rider revenues were offset by higher electric transmission service expenses 
estimated increases to alliant energy s electric margins from the impacts of weather during and were million and million  respectively 
vs 
summary electric margins increased million  or  primarily due to the impact of base retail rate increases excluding fuel cost recoveries and transmission rider at ipl and wpl  which increased electric revenues by 
table of contents million in other increases to electric margins included million of lower purchased electric capacity expenses at wpl related to the kewaunee ppa  higher revenues at ipl related to changes in recovery of transmission costs due to the implementation of the transmission rider in  an estimated million increase in electric margins from changes in sales caused by weather conditions in alliant energy s service territories and a increase in industrial sales volumes 
estimated increases to alliant energy s electric margins from the impacts of weather in and were million and million  respectively 
these items were partially offset by credits on iowa retail electric customers bills in resulting from the implementation of the tax benefit rider  which decreased ipl s electric revenues by million in  the impact of a wholesale formula rate change  which increased wpl s electric revenues by million in  million of lower energy conservation revenues at ipl  million of higher purchased power electric capacity expenses at ipl related to the daec ppa  million of so emission allowance charges in and a decrease in weather normalized residential sales volumes 
changes in energy conservation revenues are largely offset by changes in energy conservation expenses included in other operation and maintenance expenses

electric production fuel and energy purchases fuel related cost recoveries alliant energy burns coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity at its generating facilities 
the cost of fossil fuels used during each period is included in electric production fuel expense 
alliant energy also purchases electricity to meet the demand of its customers and charges these costs to energy purchases expense 
alliant energy s electric production fuel expense decreased million  or  and increased million  or  in and  respectively 
the decrease was largely due to lower miso dispatch of alliant energy s generating facilities 
alliant energy s generating facilities were dispatched at a lower level during because electricity could be purchased in the miso market at prices that were lower than the cost to generate electricity at certain of alliant energy s generating facilities 
the increase was primarily due to higher coal volumes burned at its generating facilities resulting from increased generation needed to serve the higher electricity demand in and higher delivered coal prices 
alliant energy s energy purchases expense increased million  or  and decreased million  or  in and  respectively 
the increase was largely due to increased electricity purchases in the miso market

other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices  investment prices and interest rates 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl have risk management policies to monitor and assist in mitigating these market risks and use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
refer to 
notes i and 
of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative instruments 
commodity price alliant energy  ipl and wpl are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of commodities they procure and market 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl employ established policies and procedures to mitigate their risks associated with these market fluctuations  including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s exposure to commodity price risks in their utility businesses is also significantly mitigated by current rate making structures in place for recovery of their electric production fuel and purchased energy expenses fuel related costs as well as their cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
ipl s electric and gas tariffs and wpl s wholesale electric and gas 
table of contents tariffs provide for subsequent monthly adjustments to their tariff rates for material changes in prudently incurred commodity costs 
ipl s and wpl s rate mechanisms  combined with commodity derivatives  significantly reduce commodity risk associated with their electric and gas margins 
wpl s retail electric margins have the most exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices for alliant energy and wpl due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs 
the cost recovery mechanism applicable for wpl s retail electric customers is based on forecasts of fuel related costs expected to be incurred during forward looking test year periods and fuel monitoring ranges determined by the pscw during each retail electric rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding 
under this cost recovery mechanism  if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside this fuel monitoring range during the test period  wpl is authorized to defer the incremental under over collection of fuel related costs from retail electric customers that are outside the approved ranges 
deferral of under collection of fuel related costs are reduced to the extent wpl s return on common equity during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the most recently authorized return on common equity 
retail fuel related costs incurred by wpl in were lower than retail fuel related costs used to determine rates for such period resulting in an over collection of fuel related costs for of approximately million including million outside the approved range for 
as of december   alliant energy and wpl recorded million in regulatory liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets for refunds expected to be used to adjust fuel related cost changes in in december  the pscw approved annual forecasted fuel related costs per mwh of based on million of variable fuel related costs for wpl s test period 
these fuel related costs will be monitored using an annual bandwidth of plus or minus 
based on the cost recovery mechanism in wisconsin  the annual forecasted fuel related costs approved by the pscw in december and an annual bandwidth of plus or minus  alliant energy and wpl currently estimate the commodity risk exposure to their electric margins in is approximately million

critical accounting policies and estimates pensions and other postretirement benefits for the impacts of changes in discount rates on retirement plan obligations and costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements 
based on historical experience and various other factors  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to their business and the understanding of their financial results as they require critical assumptions and judgments by management 
the results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual financial results may differ materially from these estimates 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of their board of directors 
refer to 
note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contingencies alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts for any contingent events that are both probable and reasonably estimated based upon current available information 
the amounts recorded may differ from the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is resolved 
the estimates that alliant energy  ipl and wpl make in accounting for contingencies  and the gains and losses that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  could have a significant effect on the results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 

note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements provides discussion of contingencies assessed at december  including various pending legal proceedings that may have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities alliant energy s utility subsidiaries ipl and wpl are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  they are subject to accounting guidance for regulated operations  which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory agencies in the rate making process 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable of recovery in future customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl recognize regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities in accordance with the rulings of applicable federal and state regulators  and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of their regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period regarding whether their regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and their regulatory liabilities are probable future obligations by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and historical decisions by such regulatory agencies regarding similar regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
the judgments used by regulatory authorities have an impact on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these judgments may result in a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 

note b of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements provides details of the nature and amounts of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities assessed at december  as well as material changes to their regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities during long lived assets alliant energy  ipl and wpl complete periodic assessments regarding the recoverability of certain long lived assets when factors indicate the carrying value of such assets may be impaired or such assets are planned to be sold 
these assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management 
the long lived assets assessed for impairment generally include assets within their non regulated operations that are proposed to be sold or are generating operating losses  and certain long lived assets within their regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from ipl s and wpl s customers as a result of regulatory decisions in the future 
non regulated operations factors considered in determining if an impairment review is necessary for long lived assets within non regulated operations include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry  regulatory or economic trends 
when an impairment review is deemed necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy s and ipl s long lived assets within their non regulated operations assessed in included a wind site currently expected to be used to develop a future wind project 
in addition  alliant energy s long lived assets within its non regulated operations assessed in also included the franklin county wind project 
franklin county wind project alliant energy completed construction of its mw franklin county wind project and placed it into service in december alliant energy performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of the franklin county wind project given a significant change in the use of the asset as a result of it being placed into service  continued downturn in forward electricity prices in and no long term off take arrangement 
the evaluation concluded the undiscounted cash flows expected from the franklin county wind project during its estimated useful life exceeded its carrying value as of december   resulting in no impairment 
changes in the estimated cash flows could result in the undiscounted cash flows being less than the carrying amount and a future material impairment could be required 

table of contents primary factors that could have an effect on the future expected cash flows for the project include the price of electricity generated from the project during its useful life  the volume of electricity generated  the expected life of the project and changes in anticipated operation and maintenance expenses 
an impairment of the franklin county wind project could be triggered in the future if long term electricity prices stay at current depressed levels or decline even further  or if the expected output or life of the project is significantly reduced 
as of december   the capitalized expenditures for the project were million

other future considerations provide discussion of a cash grant related to the franklin county wind project 
undeveloped wind site as of december   alliant energy and ipl have an undeveloped wind site with capitalized costs of million related to ipl s mw of wind site capacity in franklin county  iowa 
alliant energy and ipl assessed the recoverability of this undeveloped wind site given the long term period projected until the site is utilized and concluded no impairment was required as of december  changes in the future use of this undeveloped wind site could result in a future material impairment 
the future utilization of this undeveloped wind site is dependent on the future demand of wind energy in the region where the wind site is located 
the future demand of wind energy in the region where the wind site is located is dependent on various factors including future government incentives for wind projects  energy policy and legislation including federal and state renewable energy standards and regulation of carbon emissions  electricity and fossil fuel prices  transmission constraints in the region where the wind site is located and further technological advancements for wind generation 
alliant energy and ipl currently believe  based on a combination of the various factors  further wind development in the region where the wind site is located will occur 
alliant energy and ipl could realize an impairment related to this wind site if one or more of these factors are no longer expected to occur  or actions by regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over ipl indicate the costs of the undeveloped wind site would not be approved to be recovered from customers 
regulated operations long lived assets within regulated operations are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate all or a portion of the carrying value of the assets may be disallowed for rate making purposes 
if ipl or wpl is disallowed recovery of any portion of the carrying value of its regulated property  plant and equipment that has been recently completed or is probable of abandonment  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value that was disallowed 
if ipl or wpl is disallowed a full or partial return on the carrying value of its regulated property  plant and equipment that has been recently completed or is probable of abandonment  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of the future revenues expected from its regulated property  plant and equipment 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s long lived assets within their regulated operations that were assessed for impairment in included wpl s bent tree phase i wind project  ipl s whispering willow east wind project  and ipl s and wpl s generating units subject to early retirement 
wpl s bent tree phase i wind project wpl placed the remaining portion of its mw bent tree phase i wind project in service in in  wpl requested that miso conduct an optional study to identify any local transmission constraints that would prevent full output of the bent tree wind project 
based on the results of the optional study performed by miso  wpl requested that itc perform a facilities study to determine the feasibility and cost of an upgrade to a local transmission line needed to enable bent tree to achieve full generation capacity  which itc completed in wpl entered into a facility construction agreement fca with itc and miso in to address the local transmission system constraint 
pursuant to the fca and itc s attachment ff tariff  wpl advanced funds to itc in and necessary to construct the transmission upgrades on itc s system 
as of december   alliant energy and wpl recorded million in deferred charges and other on their consolidated balance sheets related to the project constructed by itc 
miso is expected to complete the definitive planning phase study for bent tree in the first half of if the facilities are identified as required network upgrades as a result of the miso definitive planning phase study  the facilities will be entitled to cost reimbursement from itc  and wpl will be reimbursed by itc for up to of the transmission upgrade costs 
while alliant energy and wpl believe their cost of the facilities will be reimbursed fully by itc  alliant energy and wpl could record an impairment of these costs if they are determined not to be a required network upgrade and thus fail to qualify for reimbursement under itc s current attachment ff tariff mechanism or if there is a change in itc s current attachment ff tariff mechanism  and wpl is not able to recover these costs from its electric customers

table of contents generating units subject to early retirement due to current and proposed environmental regulations  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are evaluating future plans for their electric generation fleet and have announced the early retirement of certain older and less efficient egus 
when it becomes probable that an egu will be retired before the end of its useful life  alliant energy  ipl and wpl must assess whether the egu meets the criteria to be considered abandoned 
egus that are considered to be abandoned generally have material remaining net book values and are expected to cease operations in the near term significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives 
if an egu meets the criteria to be considered abandoned  alliant energy  ipl and wpl must assess the probability of full recovery of the remaining carrying value of such egu 
if it is probable that regulators will not allow full recovery of and a full return on the remaining carrying amount of the abandoned egu  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the remaining carrying value and the present value of the future revenues expected from the abandoned egu 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl evaluated their egus that are subject to early retirement and determined they did not have any egus that met the criteria to be considered abandoned as of december  changes in the conclusions of whether an egu is considered abandoned and the probability of regulators allowing full recovery of and return on the remaining carrying amount of egus considered to be abandoned could result in future material impairments

unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility operations 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of customers meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated at the end of each reporting period and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded 
the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather impacts  line losses and the most recent customer rates 
such process involves the use of various judgments and assumptions and significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations 
as of december   unbilled revenues related to alliant energy s utility operations were million million at ipl and million at wpl

note c of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements provides recent developments of the class action lawsuit filed against the cash balance plan in income taxes alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period to estimate their income tax assets  liabilities  benefits and expenses 
judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections 
significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s critical assumptions and judgments for include projections of qualifying repairs expenditures and allocation of mixed service costs due to the impact of iowa rate making principles on such property related differences  and projections of future taxable income used to determine their ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration and the states in which such future taxable income will be apportioned 
effect of rate making on property related differences alliant energy s and ipl s effective tax rates are normally impacted by certain property related differences at ipl for which deferred tax is not recorded in the income statement pursuant to iowa rate making principles 
in  ipl filed a request with the iub to create a regulatory liability account for potential tax benefits and expenses resulting from certain of these property related differences caused by changes in accounting methodologies and tax elections available under the internal revenue code 
these tax benefits related to the tax treatment of repair expenditures  allocation of insurance proceeds from the floods in and allocation of mixed services costs 
in  ipl received approval from the iub to record any tax benefits and expenses from these changes in accounting methodologies in a regulatory liability account until the irs audit process related to such changes in accounting methodologies was completed 
the irs audit process was completed for allocation of mixed service costs with the income tax return for calendar year and repairs expenditures with the income tax return for calendar year as a result  ipl has recognized the tax benefits and expenses from the change in accounting method for allocation of mixed service costs through and the tax benefits and expenses from the change in accounting method for repairs expenditures through in a regulatory liability referred to as the tax benefit riders 
the tax benefits and expenses from the changes in accounting method for allocation of mixed service costs subsequent to and the tax benefits and expenses from the changes in accounting method for repairs expenditures subsequent to are being recorded consistent with general iowa rate making principles  which impact income tax expense and benefits at alliant energy and ipl 
changes in assumptions regarding the amount of ipl s qualifying repairs expenditures and allocation of mixed service costs could result in a material impact on alliant energy s and ipl s financial condition and results of operations

based on current projections of future taxable income  alliant energy  ipl and wpl plan to utilize substantially all of these carryforwards prior to their expiration 
changes in assumptions regarding alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s future taxable income could require valuation allowances in the future resulting in a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations 
state apportionment alliant energy  ipl and wpl utilize state apportionment projections to record their deferred tax assets and liabilities each reporting period 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements are recorded utilizing currently enacted tax rates and estimates of future state apportionment rates expected to be in effect at the time the temporary differences reverse 
these state apportionment projections are most significantly impacted by the estimated amount of revenues expected in the future from each state jurisdiction for alliant energy s consolidated tax group  including both its regulated operations and its non regulated operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl recorded million  million and million  respectively  of income tax expense in the first quarter of due to changes in state apportionment projections caused by the anticipated sale of alliant energy s rmt business that was completed in january a significant majority of the additional income tax expense recognized from changes in state apportionment projections were recorded at ipl and wpl due to their large deferred tax liability positions at december  refer to

table of contents other future considerations in addition to items discussed earlier in mda  the 
combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item and 
risk factors in item a  the following items could impact alliant energy s  ipl s or wpl s future financial condition or results of operations electric transmission service charges ipl and wpl currently receive substantially all their transmission services from itc and atc  respectively 
the annual transmission service rates that itc or atc charges their customers are calculated each calendar year using a ferc approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as attachment o 
the attachment o rate is based on itc s or atc s projected net revenue requirement for the upcoming calendar year ie  the year the rates will be billed as well as any true up adjustment for any over or under recovered amounts from previous calendar years 
for itc  the true up adjustment is applied two years subsequent to the collected year 
for atc  an over collection is refunded to its customers in the subsequent year and an under collection is recovered two years subsequent to the collected year 
because attachment o is a ferc approved formula rate  itc and atc can implement new rates each calendar year without filing a request with ferc 
however  new rates are subject to challenge by ferc if the rates proposed by itc or atc are determined by ferc to be unjust or unreasonable or another mechanism is determined by ferc to be just and reasonable 
ferc is currently performing an investigation into attachment o protocols focusing on the areas of participation  transparency and challenge procedures 
ipl filed comments related to itc s attachment o protocols 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts this investigation will have on future electric transmission service charges 
electric transmission service expenses rates charged by itc to ipl in september  itc filed with miso the attachment o rate it proposes to charge its customers in for electric transmission services 
the proposed rate was based on itc s net revenue requirement for as well as a true up adjustment credit related to amounts that itc over recovered from its customers in the attachment o rate filed with miso is approximately higher than the rate itc charged its customers in rates charged by atc to wpl in september  atc shared with its customers the attachment o rate it proposes to charge them in for electric transmission services 
the proposed rate was based on atc s net revenue requirement for as well as a true up adjustment credit related to amounts that atc over recovered from its customers in the attachment o rate is approximately higher than the rate atc charged its customers in miso transmission charges billed to ipl and wpl miso tariffs billed to ipl and wpl include costs related to various shared transmission projects including multi value projects mvps 
mvps include new large scale transmission projects that enable the reliable and economic delivery of energy in support of documented energy policy mandates or provide economic value across multiple pricing zones within miso 
mvp costs are socialized across the entire miso footprint based on energy usage of each miso participant 
miso tariffs billed to ipl and wpl also include costs related to other shared transmission projects  including projects designed to reduce market congestion  to provide interconnection to the transmission grid for new generation  and to ensure compliance with applicable standards 
the costs of these projects are allocated to miso participants in a way that is commensurate with the benefit to the participants pricing zone 
the miso transmission charges billed to ipl and wpl are expected to increase in the future due to the increased number of shared transmission projects occurring in the miso region 
the increase in itc s and atc s attachment o rates and miso transmission charges for shared transmission projects are expected to contribute to material increases in future electric transmission service charges for ipl and wpl 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently estimate their electric transmission service expenses in will be higher than the comparable expenses charged in by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of the increase in ipl s electric transmission service expenses is expected to be offset with increases in electric revenues resulting from the automatic transmission cost recovery rider approved by the iub and implemented in a significant portion of the increase in wpl s electric transmission service expenses was utilized to set electric revenues approved by the pscw in wpl s latest retail electric base rate case 

table of contents itc s attachment ff tariff in september  ipl filed a formal complaint with ferc alleging that itc s attachment ff tariff is unjust  unreasonable and unduly discriminatory to ipl and its customers 
in the complaint  ipl alleges that its customers have made payments of million in incremental costs for the period through as compared to costs that would have been charged under the version of attachment ff tariff applicable in the majority of the miso pricing zones without obtaining equal benefits 
the complaint filed with ferc also includes estimates that ipl s customers could make aggregate payments of million in incremental costs for the period through ipl requested in its formal complaint that ferc investigate itc s attachment ff tariff  establish a refund date of september  with respect to the complaint  and establish hearing procedures 
ipl also requested that if ferc determines that itc s attachment ff tariff is unjust and unreasonable then it should require itc to file revisions to conform its attachment ff tariff to the miso attachment ff tariff  which is applicable in the majority of the other pricing zones 
in october  itc filed a response to ipl s formal complaint 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to predict what action ferc may take regarding ipl s formal complaint or a time line under which ferc may act  but believe the outcome could be material to the future amount of transmission service costs billed by itc to ipl 
alliant energy and ipl expect any changes in the amount of electric transmission services expenses resulting from ipl s formal complaint will have a comparable offsetting impact in electric revenues due to the automatic transmission cost recovery rider approved by the iub and implemented in ferc order in  ferc issued order  which reforms its electric transmission planning and cost allocation requirements for public utility transmission providers 
one substantial change from the order is the requirement for projects with regional cost allocation to have the federal right of first refusal rofr removed 
incumbent public utility transmission providers no longer have a federal rofr to build  own and operate large scale transmission projects located within their service territory that have regional cost sharing 
in the miso footprint  the removal of rofr is expected to create a competitive bidding process for projects subject to the rofr removal and could lead to a potential decrease in the expected costs of impacted future transmission projects 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts this order may have on their future electric transmission service charges 
ferc audit of itc ferc audit staff conducted an audit of itc s compliance with certain of ferc s regulations and conditions established in ferc s approval of itc s acquisition of ipl s electric transmission assets 
in september  ferc audit staff issued an audit report that identified certain findings and recommendations related to specific aspects of the accounting treatment for the acquisition 
in january  ferc approved the issuance of a million refund to ipl through a true up adjustment in under its formula rates from itc 
ipl currently expects to pass on the iowa retail potion of this refund to its electric customers in iowa in through the transmission cost rider 
government incentives for wind projects alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s generation plans have included building wind projects to produce electricity to meet customer demand and renewable portfolio standards 
in addition to producing electricity  these wind projects also generate material incentives depending on when they are placed in service 
the arra enacted in provided incentives to owners of wind projects placed into service between january  and december  the incentive options available to qualified wind projects under the arra include production tax credits for a year period based on the electricity output generated by the wind project  an investment tax credit equal to of the qualified cost basis of the wind project  or a government grant equal to of the qualified cost basis of wind projects that began construction in and in  the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of modified the requirements for the government grant incentive 
the government grant incentive is now available for qualified wind projects that began construction in  and and are placed into service by december  alliant energy has four wind projects that currently qualify for one of the government incentives wpl s cedar ridge wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late  ipl s whispering willow east wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late  wpl s bent tree phase i wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late  and resources franklin county wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late based on an evaluation of the most beneficial alternative for customers  alliant energy  ipl and wpl chose to recognize production tax credits for the three ipl and wpl wind projects 
alliant energy chose to elect the government cash grant equal to of the qualified cost basis of its franklin county wind project 
refer to 
note d of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of possible federal spending cuts  or sequestration  which may cause alliant energy to reevaluate its options on government incentive elections for the franklin county wind project 

table of contents production tax credits the amount of production tax credits earned is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by each wind project  which is impacted by a variety of operating and economic parameters including transmission availability
