risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we produce potash and langbeinite  which we market and sell as trio 
our revenues are generated exclusively from the sale of potash and trio 
our potash is marketed for sale into three primary markets the agricultural market as fertilizer  the industrial market as a component in drilling and fracturing fluids for oil and gas wells  and the animal feed market as a nutrient 
our primary regional markets include agricultural areas and feed manufacturers in the central and western united states  as well as oil and gas drilling areas in the rocky mountains and the greater permian basin 
in addition to the agricultural regions noted above  we also have sales  primarily of trio  that go into the southeastern and eastern united states 
our production facilities all are located in the western united states  and therefore our operations are affected by weather and other conditions in this region 
we own five active production facilities three in new mexico referenced collectively below as carlsbad or individually as west  east  and north and two in utah moab and wendover and we have a current estimated annual productive capacity of approximately  tons of potash  not including an estimated  tons of designed productive capacity for the hb solar solution mine  and based on current design  approximately  tons of langbeinite 
we are not yet producing at an annual rate of  tons per year of langbeinite 
we are continuing to commission the langbeinite recovery plant and will update productive capacity numbers as improvements are realized 
actual production is affected by operating rates  recoveries  mining rates  precipitation and evaporation rates at our solar solution operations  and the amount of development work that we do 
therefore  our production results tend to be lower than our productive capacity 
the hb solar solution mine is under development in carlsbad  new mexico 
construction continues to progress on the hb solar solution mine  a project to apply solution mining and solar evaporation techniques to produce potash from previously idled mine workings close to our current underground operations near carlsbad  new mexico 
we also have additional opportunities to develop mineralized deposits of potash in new mexico which could include additional solar solution mining opportunities near our current operations in new mexico  reopening of the north mine  which was operated as a traditional underground mine until the early s  as well as the acceleration of production from our reserves and mineralized deposits of potash through new access points in the area and the potential construction of additional production facilities in the region 
significant business trends and activities our financial results are impacted by several significant trends  which are described below 
we expect that these trends will continue to affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
construction of the hb solar solution mine and north compaction facility 
we are making significant progress on the construction of the hb solar solution mine 
construction of the solar evaporation ponds continues to advance  and we have pumped potash enriched brine from the underground mines into several of the evaporation ponds 
we have also substantially completed all of the drilling activities associated with the injection  extraction  and water wells that were contemplated in our initial design 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we began construction of the processing mill  which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of the total expected investment for the project is between million and million  of which million had been invested as of december  the construction of the new north compaction facility is also progressing well with million of the expected million to million investment made by december  this new facility expands our granulation capacity to accommodate the increased tonnage expected from the hb solar solution mine and ongoing expansions at our west mine 
the new north compaction plant will utilize state of the art equipment providing us the tools to provide high quality granular production from this facility 

table of contents potash demand 
we sold  tons of potash in  approximately  tons more than the  tons of potash we produced during the year 
despite challenging weather and market conditions  we were able to sell approximately  more tons than we sold in potash demand in north america for the growing season was in line with historical levels 
during  the drought across much of the midwest caused lower grain yields  which in turn tightened stocks to use ratios 
there were  however  certain regions of the united states and canada that saw above average crop yields  which partially offset the lower yields in the midwest 
the drought did have an overall net negative impact on crop yields and the resulting lower stocks to use ratio caused commodity prices for grains to increase during the outlook continues to be favorable for farmer economics in with expected continued tight stocks of grains 
as a result  we expect that potash demand in north america for the growing season will be in line with historical levels 
over the last several years  fertilizer dealers have sought to lower their risk profile  which has led to lower average inventory levels owned by dealers in the overall north american distribution system 
it has also resulted in dealers carrying low inventory over summer and winter months  as they have sought to end the fall and spring seasons with minimal inventory levels  thereby reducing their working capital requirements 
potash producers have responded to this trend by increasing the amount of producer owned inventory at dealer locations in an effort to get product closer to the end user 
as in past years  the timing of farmer potash application in will remain weather dependent and soil specific for different growing regions 
this is expected to lead to increased variability in potash demand at the distribution level of the supply chain  which makes the timing of dealer purchases of potash unpredictable  increasing volatility of sales volumes from quarter to quarter 
potash prices 
potash prices are a significant driver of profitability for our business 
our average net realized sales price decreased to per ton in the fourth quarter of from in the third quarter of for the full year  potash prices moved from an average net realized sales price of per ton in to per ton in although we do not participate in the export market to china  india and brazil  these markets have an impact on north american pricing 
concern around potash demand in china and india created uncertainty around potash production levels and pricing  prompting some north american producers to curtail production during the fourth quarter of and into the first quarter of despite the curtailments  north american producers increased their inventory levels and  as a result  we have experienced greater price competition in north america  thus driving potash prices lower in north america 
moving into  although china and india have signed contracts for the first half of  we are seeing continued pressure on potash prices and ongoing uncertainty in the world economy which continues to further cloud the global potash market 
if additional brownfield potash production is brought on line globally  adding additional production to the market  there could be further price erosion if global potash consumption does not increase 
trio prices and demand 
the average net realized sales price of trio has increased from per ton in to per ton in we continue to have strong demand for all sizes of our trio product 
trio domestic pricing has historically tended to move in a relatively close relationship to potash  although  over the last year  dealers and farmers recognition of the added value of magnesium and sulfate from this specialty product has translated into higher prices 
demand in excess of production has also been supportive of trio pricing 
export trio pricing continues to show strength as international customers see value for trio 
trio sales in are expected to essentially match production levels due to the low inventory levels we have available for sale as of the end of operating efficiencies 
we have dedicated significant resources to the long term improvement plan we implemented in the beginning of to address production challenges at the east plant 
execution of the long term improvement plan is expected to continue in we have seen steady and measurable improvement as we execute the plan  particularly for potash production 
specifically  our potash production from the east facility increased sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter  from the second quarter to the third quarter  and from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in  and is now approaching some of the highest historical levels on an annualized run rate basis 
we expect langbeinite production levels in to be greater than those realized in as the increased recovery of product from the ore is a focus for our operations team 
they have demonstrated an ability to make improvements in the facilities in a systematic and professional manner 
through  we expect to see higher average production levels of both potash and trio as a result of our focus and dedication on the long term improvement of the east facility 
with higher operating rates and productivity from our east facility  we expect that our product mix will be more heavily weighted towards the east facility than it was in this may put pressure on our per ton costs  however  we expect to maintain our annual cash costs per ton at approximately the same level by closely managing overall costs and increasing production 
selected operating and financial data

no abnormal production costs have been incurred in or in 
table of contents average net realized sales price is calculated by deducting freight costs from gross revenues and then by dividing this result by tons of product sold during the period 
on a per ton basis  by product credits were for each of the years ended december    and by product credits were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
results of operations operating highlights our net income was million  or per share with cash flows from operations of million 
we had capital investments of million in and ended the year with million of cash and investments with no debt outstanding 
we also paid a cash dividend of per share  or million  in december potash in  we sold  tons of potash as compared to  tons in in the first half of  dealers once again took a cautious approach to purchasing potash  exiting the spring and fall application seasons with low storage levels of inventory 
in the second half of  demand from dealers increased to meet demand from farmers who applied potash in the fall at better than expected levels 
our average net realized sales price of potash was per ton in  compared with per ton in this decrease is due to the lower overall global demand for potash which resulted in lower north american prices 
we continue to focus on production flexibility to support the sales needs for the diverse markets  customers  and crops that we serve 
this diversity of our sales helps us maximize the average net realized sales price for our products and helps us better manage our inventory levels 
the investments we made in granulation capacity in moab in late and wendover in late have resulted in a better quality product and have given us the production flexibility to manage our inventory levels more effectively 
these investments have also allowed us to expand our marketing into customer locations that we did not previously serve from these facilities 
our investments in granulation capacity provide us the added flexibility to better adjust the production rates to meet the demands of the specific markets 
in making our production decisions  we evaluate the relative margins we can earn as well as the demand in a specific market to produce the appropriate product 
we continue to focus on increasing our granulation capacity and efficiency with the construction of an upgraded and expanded granulation facility at our north plant in carlsbad  new mexico  where the first phase of construction is anticipated to be completed in mid the percentage of our sales in each of the markets we serve stayed relatively consistent from to  with a slight increase in the percentage of agricultural sales 
sales of standard sized potash for industrial use decreased in as compared with rig counts in areas where we serve the oil and gas sector were down approximately from december   to december  we expect industrial demand for our standard sized product will correlate over the long term with oil and gas pricing  drilling  and well completion activities 
we believe that potassium chloride is the most effective clay swelling inhibitor available  and we are marketing potassium chloride as the drilling fluid additive of choice in our traditional industrial markets 
the flexibility to produce as much granular sized product as we can is important as we continue to see long term trends that support utilization of potash in agriculture 
data generated by fertecon limited  a fertilizer industry consultant  shows that over the past years  the domestic consumption for potash has averaged approximately million tons with annual volatility of approximately 
these results have occurred through historical periods of low and high agricultural commodity prices  weather conditions  variability in oil and gas drilling  negative farmer margins  and a variety of other macro economic factors 
continuing improvements in agriculture production technology  such as hybrid seeds and equipment advancements  now allow for the potential of higher yields per acre 
these improvements need to be matched with potassium application rates to maximize agricultural productivity 
the replacement of potassium in the soil is critical to continue high yielding agricultural production and to satisfy the demands placed on soils for plant nutrition 
the international plant nutrition institute has tracked historical soil potassium levels and trends show an increasing frequency of potassium deficient soils in north america 
in order for the north american farmer to maximize yields  application of higher rates of potash will be necessary in the future 
our potash sales mix was approximately as follows for the indicated periods 

table of contents year ended december  agricultural industrial feed our average potash gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in  as compared with in  with the decrease being attributable to lower average net realized sales prices in  combined with higher depreciation and depletion expenses resulting from the increased capital investment placed in service in and in  our cash operating cost of goods sold  which we define as total cost of goods sold excluding depreciation  depletion  amortization and royalties  net of by product credits  for potash increased to per ton from per ton in this increase was primarily driven by higher per ton costs from our east facility as operating time and availability at our east plant was reduced in part due to plant inefficiencies  which caused lower recoveries of potash in the first part of our production volume of potash in was  tons  or  tons less than in  primarily as a result of the poor early year performance of the east plant 
trio our trio production and resulting inventory levels were lower in than they were in as a result  our sales of trio decreased from  tons of trio in to  tons of trio in pricing and demand for this specialty product remain strong 
pricing gains offset the decreased sales volumes  resulting in consistent net sales revenues in compared with with continuing strong demand for this specialty product we expect sales demand will at least meet our production capabilities in our average trio gross margins have increased in as our average net realized sales price for trio increased by per ton  while our cost of goods sold for trio increased by per ton  for as compared with a key element of the long term improvement plan at our east facility is the continuing commissioning work on the lrip 
although we have seen improvement in our trio recoveries as a result of our work thus far on the long term improvement plan  the expected production benefits from the lrip have yet to be fully realized 
we remain committed to continuing the long term improvement plan and commissioning work on lrip to obtain increased recoveries and therefore increased production levels of langbeinite 
this will result in the need to invest additional capital to redesign specific elements of the plant  the determination of the amount of additional investment will be refined as we conclude our commissioning work and long term improvement plan at the east facility 
average net realized sales price domestic pricing of our potash is influenced principally by the price established by our competitors 
the interaction of global potash supply and demand  ocean  land and barge freight rates  and currency fluctuations also influence pricing 
any of these factors could have a positive or negative impact on the price of our products 
our average net realized sales price for potash decreased in the fourth quarter of by per ton from the third quarter of  largely in response to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding production and consumption in the global potash market which kept buyers cautious in the short term 
we believe potash buying and pricing will trade in a relatively narrow range  due to the strong corn and soybean commodity prices that support favorable farmer economics 
we expect our average net realized sales price in the first quarter of to be slightly below the levels experienced in the fourth quarter of  as a result of lower potash prices posted by our competitors for sales into north america 
we market trio as a specialty product 
as farmers have increasingly recognized the agronomic value of the magnesium and sulfate delivered by this product  demand for the product has grown and we have enjoyed a higher market price through and this recognition  when combined with our lower inventory levels  has resulted in pricing that more closely reflects the agronomic value of the delivered nutrients 
the table below demonstrates the progression of our average net realized sales price for potash and trio from to we calculate average net realized sales price by deducting freight costs from gross revenues and then by dividing this result by tons of product sold during the period 

table of contents average net realized sales price for the three months ended potash trio per ton december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  specific factors affecting our results sales our gross sales are derived from the sales of potash and trio and are determined by the quantities of product we sell and the sales prices we realize 
we quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick up at our plants and warehouses 
freight costs are incurred on only a portion of our sales as many of our customers arrange and pay for their own freight directly 
when we arrange and pay for freight  our quotes and billings are based on expected freight costs to the points of delivery 
our gross sales include the freight that we bill  but we do not believe that gross sales provide a representative measure of our performance in the market due to variations caused by ongoing changes in the proportion of customers paying for their own freight  the geographic distribution of our products  and freight rates 
we view net sales  which are gross sales less freight costs  as the key performance indicator of our revenue as it conveys the net sales price of the product that we realize 
we manage our sales and marketing operations centrally and we work to achieve the highest average net realized sales price we can by evaluating the product needs of our customers and associated logistics and then determining which of our production facilities can best satisfy these needs 
the volume of product we sell is determined by demand for our products and by our production capabilities 
we intend to operate our facilities at full production levels  which provides the greatest operating efficiencies 
by having adequate warehouse capacity  we can maintain production levels during periods of fluctuating product demand 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold reflects the costs to produce our potash and trio products  less credits generated from the sale of our by products 
many of our production costs are largely fixed and  consequently  our costs of sales per ton on a facility by facility basis tend to move inversely with the number of tons we produce  within the context of normal production levels 
our principal production costs include labor and employee benefits  maintenance materials  contract labor  and materials for operating or maintenance projects  natural gas  electricity  operating supplies  chemicals  depreciation and depletion  royalties  and leasing costs 
there are elements of our cost structure associated with contract labor  consumable operating supplies  and reagents and royalties that are variable  which make up a smaller component of our cost base 
our periodic production costs and costs of goods sold will not necessarily match one another from period to period based on the fluctuation of inventory and production levels 
our production costs per ton are also impacted when our production levels change  due to factors such as changes in mine development  downtime  and annual maintenance turnarounds 
our labor and contract labor costs in carlsbad  new mexico  may continue to be influenced most directly by the demand for labor in the local carlsbad  new mexico region where we compete for labor with the potash  oil and gas  and nuclear waste storage industries 
additionally  the east mine has a complex mineralogy with a mixed ore body comprised of potash and langbeinite that is processed through a singular product flow at the surface facility 
this complex mineralogy will influence the amount of product tons of potash and trio ultimately produced from the facility  which impacts our production costs per ton for each product and affect our quarter to quarter results 
we pay royalties to federal  state  and private lessors under our mineral leases  and such payments are typically a percentage of net sales of minerals extracted and sold under the applicable lease 
in some cases  federal royalties for potash are paid on a sliding scale basis that varies with the grade of ore extracted 
for the years ended december    and  our average royalty rate was  and  respectively 
we expect that future average royalty rates will increase as certain new mexico mineral leases are currently being renewed at a fixed royalty rate of 

table of contents income taxes we are a subchapter c corporation and  therefore  are subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income 
for the years ended december    and  our effective income tax rate was  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rates are impacted primarily by changes in the underlying tax rates in jurisdictions in which we are subject to income tax and permanent differences between book and tax income for the period  including the benefit associated with the estimated effect of the depletion and domestic production activities deduction 
our federal and state income tax returns are subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities 
the net tax basis in the assets and liabilities at the time of our ipo was significantly higher than the book basis in the same assets and liabilities  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of approximately million as of the date of the ipo 
the majority of our deferred tax asset was assigned to mineral properties  and the anticipated use of percentage depletion to reduce our taxable income  relative to book income  is expected to provide full realization of this asset over time 
as of december   the net deferred tax asset has been reduced to approximately million  primarily through utilization of percentage depletion and placing qualified bonus depreciation assets into service in and we have evaluated our deferred tax assets to determine if the need for a valuation allowance exists  and we have concluded that no material valuation allowances are necessary 
we base this conclusion on the expectation that future taxable income should allow for full realization of these deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   the total tax expense was million 
total tax expense for the year ended december   was comprised of million of current income tax expense and million of deferred income tax expense 
for the year ended december   the total tax expense was million 
for  total tax expense was comprised of million of current income tax expense and million of deferred income tax expense 
for the year ended december   the total tax expense was million 
for  total tax expense was comprised of million of current income tax benefit and million of deferred income tax expense 
our current tax expense each of these periods is less than our total tax expense in large part due to the impacts of accelerated tax bonus depreciation and the utilization of percentage depletion 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities each reporting period using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the estimated statutory income tax rates that are applied to our current and deferred income tax calculations are impacted most significantly by the states in which we do business 
changing business conditions for normal business transactions and operations  as well as changes to state tax rate and apportionment laws  potentially alter our apportionment of income among the states for income tax purposes 
these changes in apportionment laws result in changes in the calculation of our current and deferred income taxes  including the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the effects of any such changes are recorded in the period of the adjustment 
such adjustments can increase or decrease the net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and impact the corresponding deferred tax benefit or deferred tax expense on the income statement 
capital investments we believe that  in the long term  demand for potash will remain at  or exceed  historical levels 
we have developed a capital investment plan at each of our facilities to help meet this demand 
these plans focus on growing productivity and improving recoveries while improving safe and reliable production  ensuring environmental and regulatory compliance  and improving facility reliability 
we expect these investments to grow production capacity and decrease per ton production costs while also increasing the flexibility of our production mix to support our marketing efforts 
we are continuing to increase our granulation capacity for potash  and we have already made significant steps towards improving our granulation capacity for both potash and trio through previous capital investments 
as we invest in our facilities  we seek to deploy capital while maintaining sufficient liquidity to react strategically to market conditions 
in  we invested million in capital projects as we completed over separate capital projects 
the most significant capital investments were in the hb solar solution mine  the north compaction facility  the granulation portion of our langbeinite production facility  and the completion of the second horizontal cavern system in moab 
in addition  we invested approximately million in sustaining capital 
the lrip is designed to increase our recoveries of trio from the langbeinite ore using dense media processing and to enable us to granulate all of our standard sized product  should market conditions warrant 
construction of the dense media separation component was substantially completed in december and we placed the granulation component in service in the third quarter of commissioning activities related to the lrip plant are continuing 
total investment to date for the lrip is approximately million as contemplated by the original design 
the recovery improvements have yet to be fully realized and our production results for langbeinite were below our expectations 
we have determined that we need to invest additional capital to redesign specific elements of the plant 
this redesign work is expected to occur in 
table of contents early as we continue to commission the plant  implement the long term improvement plan at the east facility  and develop best operating practices  we may determine that additional investments in the plant are necessary 
looking forward  our capital investment in is estimated in the range of million to million 
this investment will include the expected completion of the construction for both the hb solar solution mine and the expansion of our north compaction facility 
we will also be drilling the third multi lateral cavern system in moab 
these three projects  as well as numerous smaller opportunity projects  comprise capital investments between million and million  all dedicated towards increases in productivity and incremental lower cost per ton 
in addition  we anticipate deploying approximately million in sustaining capital to replace assets that have reached the end of their productive lives and to complete regulatory compliance projects 
the actual level of capital investment for the year will ultimately be impacted by the timing of deliveries of equipment and construction 
we expect our operating plans and capital programs to be funded out of operating cash flows  existing cash and investments  and potential use of our unsecured credit facility prior to receipt of the proceeds from the funding of the notes 
the following details several of the significant projects that are designed to improve the overall reliability of the operations and to increase productive and compaction capacity we are making significant progress on the hb solar solution mine  as discussed previously 
the total expected investment for the project is between million and million  of which million had been invested as of december  the total current expected investment represents an increase of approximately from the mid point of this range compared to the mid point of the previous range 
we increased the total anticipated investment for design modifications that will utilize a more consistent and proven application of technology with proven flotation and screening technology and as a result of increased well drilling costs 
we currently expect first production of finished product from the hb solar solution mine to occur late in the fourth quarter of after the summer evaporation season and completion of the mill  with ramp up of production expected in  and production levels increasing into  assuming the benefit of an average annual evaporation cycle applied to full evaporation ponds 
the anticipated production schedule may be impacted by any construction delays and the impact of weather events or patterns on evaporation seasons 
the north compaction project is expected to be completed in phases to coincide with the production increases from the hb solar solution mine and the expansion of mining and milling capacity at the west mine 
construction of the first compactor line of the compaction plant is scheduled to be completed in phases throughout and into the beginning of to ensure adequate capacity for the increased throughput expected at the west plant and the anticipated production from the hb solar solution mine 
total capital investment for the project is expected to be approximately million to million  of which approximately million had been invested as of december  we are developing additional solution mining opportunities at our moab facility 
we completed the expansion of our producing cavern systems in the fourth quarter of and are now actively engaged in developing a third multi lateral cavern system 
this represents a capital investment of approximately million to million  the majority of which we expect to invest in the addition of the new horizontal cavern systems is expected to provide higher grade brines which not only offset the typical decreasing production profile as other cavern systems are depleted  but also allows for incremental production opportunities 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  we had no debt  and we had million available under our unsecured credit facility 
the million was made up of million in cash  million in cash equivalent investments  consisting of money market accounts with banking institutions that we believe are financially sound  million invested in short term investments  respectively  comprised of certificates of deposit investments of million and corporate debt securities of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold certain of our investments that had been previously classified as held to maturity securities in order to pay the million special dividend in december our operations have been and are expected to be primarily funded from cash on hand and cash generated by operations and  if necessary  we have the ability to borrow under our unsecured credit facility 

table of contents year ended december  in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities operating activities total cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to inventory decreased million as we increased our sales levels ahead of production in  which increased our operating cash flows 
in addition  we experienced an increase in trade and other receivables  which is related to a refundable employment related credit in the state of new mexico 
total cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to primarily due to higher net income  driven by higher average net realized sales prices for both potash and trio 
the increase in cash was offset by an increase in inventory as product sales largely matched production levels  compared to  in which our product sales were in excess of production levels 
additionally  we experienced an increase in other receivables as of december   compared to december   due to the recording of a refundable employment related credit in the state of new mexico  of which million was recorded as a receivable as of december  investing activities total cash used in investing activities decreased in compared to due to an increase in the proceeds from the sale of investments and a reduction in purchases of investments 
these net proceeds were used to fund our increased activity associated with investments in property  plant  and equipment  mineral properties and development costs of million in  and the special dividend paid in december the level of capital investment in increased from the million invested in total cash used in investing activities increased in compared to due to an increase in the amount of cash invested in property  plant  and equipment as well as mineral properties and development costs to million in from million in in  we continued to invest excess cash in higher yielding corporate and government agency securities by purchasing million of investments and receiving million in proceeds from maturing investments 
financing activities for the year ended december   we declared and paid a special dividend of per share or million 
we also paid million for employees minimum statutory tax withholdings upon the vesting of certain restricted stock awards for employees who elected to net share settle their awards 
in  we paid million for employees minimum statutory tax withholdings upon the vesting of certain restricted stock awards for employees who elected to net share settle their awards 
we also paid million in debt issuance costs related to the unsecured credit facility 
unsecured credit facility we have an unsecured credit facility  led by us bank  as administrative agent  and wells fargo bank  as syndication agent 
this unsecured credit facility provides a total facility of million 
the facility is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and includes financial covenants requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
the facility has a five year term through august the entire amount of the facility was available for use as of december  outstanding balances under the unsecured credit facility bear interest at a floating rate  which  at our option  is either the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin of between and  depending upon our leverage ratio  which is equal to the ratio of our total funded indebtedness to our adjusted earnings for the prior four fiscal quarters before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain other expenses  or an alternative base rate  plus a margin of between and  depending upon our leverage ratio 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the outstanding portion of the unused revolving unsecured credit facility amount of between and  depending on our leverage ratio 
the interest rate paid under our unsecured credit facility on any debt varies both with the change in the libor rates and with our leverage ratio 

table of contents unsecured senior notes in august  we entered into a note purchase agreement that provides for the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of the notes on april  the notes  when issued  will consist of the following series million of senior notes  series a  due april  million of senior notes  series b  due april  million of senior notes  series c  due april  the notes will be senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with any of our other unsubordinated unsecured indebtedness 
the obligations under the notes will be unconditionally guaranteed by our material subsidiaries 
the note purchase agreement includes financial covenants requiring a minimum fixed charge ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
interest on the notes will begin to accrue on the expected funding date of april   and will be paid semiannually on april and october of each year  beginning on october  contractual obligations as of december   we had contractual obligations totaling million on an undiscounted basis  as indicated below 
contractual commitments shown are for the full calendar year indicated unless otherwise indicated

we have committed to purchase a minimum quantity of natural gas  which is priced at floating index dependent rates plus to  estimated based on forward rates 
amounts are based on spot rates inclusive of estimated transportation costs and sales tax 
as we anticipate terminating our obligations under the pension plan  our remaining liability is estimated to be funded in the first half of our actual contribution requirements are contingent upon the timing of the pension plan termination  as well as participant settlement obligations 
we expect to record an additional expense on termination of the pension plan at the date we are released from the liability in an amount equal to the difference between the final amount funded  the recorded pension liability and the unrecognized actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we currently expect the additional expense will be between million and million  depending on the funding elections of the participants 
we are obligated to reclaim and remediate lands which our operations have disturbed  but  because of the long term nature of our reserves and facilities  we estimate that the majority of those expenditures will not be required until after although our reclamation obligation activities are not required to begin until after we cease operations  we anticipate certain activities to occur prior to then related to reclamation of facilities that have been replaced with newly constructed assets  as well as certain shaft closure activities for shafts that are no longer in use 
commitments shown are in today s dollars and are undiscounted

results of operations for the years ended december   and net sales and freight costs net sales of potash increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of a increase in sales volumes of potash offset by a decrease in the average net realized sales price of potash by per ton  or 
we experienced higher potash demand from our customers during the year ended december   especially in the second half of the year when dealer demand increased to meet farmers potash needs during the fall application season 
net sales of trio increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to a increase in the average net realized sales price offset by a decrease in the volume of sales 
the decrease in sales volumes was a function of availability of product for sale as demand was significantly greater than production 
our production volume of potash in was  tons  or  tons less than in our decreased production in is the result of the production challenges we experienced at our east surface facility  as well as slightly lower production at our moab facility due to the impact of the evaporation season that was negatively impacted by cooler summer temperatures and increased levels of precipitation 
our trio production was also negatively impacted by the plant operations at the east plant and ongoing commissioning activities 
cost of goods sold the following table presents our cost of goods sold for potash and trio for the subject periods year ended december  change between periods change cost of goods sold in millions cost per ton of potash sold cost per ton of trio sold depreciation  depletion  and amortizations expense for potash was million and million in and  respectively  which equates to and on a per ton basis 
depreciation  depletion  and amortizations expense for trio was million and million in and  respectively  which equates to and on a per ton basis 
total cost of goods sold of potash  which includes royalties and depreciation  depletion and amortization  increased per ton  or  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  we experienced higher cash operating cost of goods sold per ton for the year ended december   caused by higher per ton production costs at our east mine in as operating time and plant availability at our east mine  particularly during the first half of the year  was negatively impacted by the reliability of key elements of our production process 
as a result  our per ton carrying value of inventory at the east mine entering and in early was higher than we had experienced in as we sold through that inventory  and produced higher cost tons during  these higher cost tons were reflected as cost of goods sold in in addition  we realized higher depreciation per ton for the year ended december   due to an increase in depreciation expense associated with the capital projects completed in and  combined with lower production during total cost of goods sold of trio increased per ton  or  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  this increase in cost of goods sold on a per ton basis was most significantly impacted by the commissioning of the dense media component of our langbeinite recovery improvement 
table of contents project and the lower production volumes in over which production costs are allocated 
as a result  our per ton production costs increased over those in in total  our cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the increase in total cost of goods sold was driven primarily by the higher volumes of potash sold and increased depreciation due to the capital investments in and labor and benefit costs  as well as costs incurred for chemical usage at our east plant  also experienced notable increases in compared to on a comparative basis and within our production costs  depreciation and depletion increased million  or  during as a result of the significant capital investments being brought on line over the last two years 
we expect depreciation expense to continue to increase on both an actual dollar basis and on a per ton basis as we continue to invest capital into our operations 
we manage capital investments on a basis of evaluating capital projects that we believe are necessary to maintain the productivity of our mines  as well as investment capital that is designed to increase production and generate incremental returns on invested capital 
selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expenses increased million in  as compared to the change represents a increase from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs in as a result of additional headcount as we hired more staff to support our level of process improvements and general administrative support 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in short term incentive compensation expense in as the performance metrics resulted in lower than target payouts 
recognition of income associated with deferred insurance proceeds we had million of deferred insurance proceeds recognized in as a result of the settlement of an insurance claim for damages to our warehouses 
no such event impacted other operating income during  we recorded million of other operating income from an employment related credit in the state of new mexico 
beginning in the third quarter of  the value of additional estimated credits have been recorded in the same period in which the credit was earned as a reduction to our production costs  and is reflected in the associated cost of goods sold and in the remaining inventory cost base as of december   and results of operations for the years ended december   and net sales and freight costs net sales of potash increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this change was primarily the result of an increase in the average net realized sales price of per ton  or  slightly offset by a decrease in sales volume of 
during the first six months of  strong commodity markets provided an opportunity for improved farmer economics  which in turn increased demand for potash  resulting in higher potash prices 
during the second half of  we continued to realize the benefits of our price increases until late in the fourth quarter when potash demand weakened  creating a softness in potash pricing 
our production volume of potash in was  tons  or  tons more than in our production was higher in primarily due to producing at full production levels in  whereas in  we were adding employees during the first half of the year following the market driven production reductions that started in in addition  the benefit of capital invested in and commissioned in was evident as higher production was available from additional mining panels in carlsbad 
each of these factors had a favorable influence on our per unit cash operating cost of goods sold in as compared to further  the new compactor at moab  which was placed into service in december  was fully operational during allowing us to convert standard sized potash to granular sized potash to meet market demand 
as our inventory carrying values increased at our east mine due to maintenance activities and downtime required to tie in new plant and equipment related to our langbeinite recovery improvement project in the fourth quarter 
as a result  our per ton carrying value of inventory at the east mine at the end of was higher 
net sales of trio increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to a increase in the average net realized sales price offset by a decrease in the volume of sales as we produced fewer tons of trio available for sale in as noted above 

table of contents freight costs decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a decrease in trio sales volumes 
the mix of customers paying for their own freight is highly variable and affects the freight costs incurred by us and our gross sales 
fluctuations in freight costs are not a key indicator of any business trends or our operating performance  as freight costs are largely borne by our customers  either as part of the cost of the product delivered or as arranged directly by the customer 
cost of goods sold the following table presents our cost of goods sold for potash and trio for the subject periods year ended december  change between periods change cost of goods sold in millions costs associated with abnormal production in millions cost per ton of potash sold cost per ton of trio sold depreciation  depletion  and amortizations expense for potash was million and million in and  respectively  which equates to and on a per ton basis 
depreciation  depletion  and amortizations expense for trio was million and million in and  respectively  which equates to and on a per ton basis 
total cost of goods sold of potash  which includes royalties and depreciation  depletion and amortization  was per ton for both the years ended december  and these per ton results are exclusive of approximately million of production costs for potash that were not absorbed into inventory in  due to the determination that our production rates were abnormally low in the first quarter of although the total costs of goods sold was essentially flat between and  our per ton cash operating cost of goods sold decreased due to higher production rates as fixed production costs are spread over more tons produced 
this was offset by an increase in depreciation per ton due to an increase in capital projects completed late in and in total cost of goods sold of trio increased per ton  or  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  this increase in cost of goods sold on a per ton basis is due to lower production volumes in over which production costs are allocated 
as a result  our per ton production costs increased over those in as we have relatively low volumes of trio inventory as of december   those higher per ton production costs came through as cost of goods sold in in total  our cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  prior to absorption of costs into inventory  spending increased primarily to support higher production 
costs that changed materially during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   included increases in labor  operating supplies  depreciation and royalties  partially offset by decreases in natural gas and operating leases expenses  as we exercised early lease buy out provisions on certain operating leases 
on a comparative basis and within our production costs  labor and contract labor costs increased million  or  in due to the ramp up of the carlsbad operations from the downturn in operating supplies increased million  or  in due principally to increased usage related to returning to full production by in addition to price increases on major mine operating supplies 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization increased million  or  in the year ended december   as a result of the significant capital investment during and we expect depreciation expense to continue to increase on both an actual dollar basis and on a per ton basis as we continue to invest capital into our operations 
we manage capital investments on a basis of evaluating maintenance capital that we believe is necessary to maintain the productivity of our mines and investment capital that is designed to generate a return on invested capital 
royalty expense increased million  or  from which relates to the increase in net sales 
other changes in cost of goods sold followed from increased benefits and employment taxes  usage of chemicals and reagents  and property taxes  partially offset by decreased rental costs 

table of contents selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expenses increased million in  as compared to the change represents a increase from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the short term incentive compensation expense  as the performance metrics were achieved at higher percentages than in in addition  our increases in headcount over resulted in slightly higher stock compensation expenses and travel expenses to our mines 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in professional services relative to the prior period 
recognition of income associated with deferred insurance proceeds in the first quarter of  we completed the reconstruction and commissioning of our product warehouses at our east facility and finalized insurance settlement amounts related to the associated product inventory warehouse insurance claim that resulted from a wind event that occurred in as a result  the million of deferred insurance proceeds that were recorded as of december   plus approximately million of additional insurance proceeds  were recognized as income in the three months ended march  the total of approximately million has been recorded as insurance settlements income expense from property and business losses on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  there was no cash impact associated with this event in the year ended december   as the previously deferred insurance proceeds were paid to us prior to december   with the exception of the final insurance payment of approximately million  which was paid to us in april other operating income during  we recorded million of other operating income from an employment related credit in the state of new mexico 
beginning in the third quarter of  the value of additional estimated credits have been recorded in the same period in which the credit was earned as a reduction to our production costs  and is reflected in the associated cost of goods sold and in the remaining inventory cost base as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from such estimates and assumptions  and any such differences could result in material changes to our financial statements 
the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to customers  which is generally when title passes  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
title passes at the designated shipping point for the majority of sales  but  in a few cases  title passes at the delivery destination 
the shipping point may be the plant  a distribution warehouse  a customer warehouse  or a port 
title passes for some international shipments upon payment by the purchaser  however  revenue is not recognized for these transactions until shipment because the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred pursuant to a contractual arrangement 
prices are generally set at the time of  or prior to  shipment 
in cases where the final price is determined upon resale of the product by the customer  revenue is deferred until the final sales price is known 
sales are reported on a gross basis 
we quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick up at our plants and warehouses 
when a sale occurs on a delivered basis  we incur and  in turn  bill the customer and record as gross revenue the product sales value  freight  packaging  and certain other distribution costs 
many customers  however  arrange and pay for these costs directly and  in these situations  only the product sales are included in gross revenues 
application of this policy requires that we make estimates regarding creditworthiness of the customer  which impacts the timing of revenue recognition and  ultimately  the determination of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make those estimates based on the most recent information available and historical experience  but they may be affected by subsequent changes in market conditions 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at historical cost 
expenditures for property  plant  and equipment relating to new assets or improvements are capitalized  provided the expenditure extends the useful life of an asset or extends the asset s functionality 
property  plant  and equipment are depreciated under the straight line method using estimated useful lives 
no depreciation is taken on assets classified as construction in progress until the asset is placed into service 
gains or losses are recorded upon retirement  sale or disposal of assets 
maintenance and repair 
table of contents costs are recognized as period costs when incurred 
capitalized interest  to the extent of debt outstanding  is calculated and assigned to assets that are being constructed  drilled  being built or otherwise are classified as construction in progress 
mineral properties and development costs mineral properties and development costs  which are referred to collectively as mineral properties  include acquisition costs  the cost of drilling wells  and the cost of other development work  all of which are capitalized 
depletion of mineral properties is calculated using the units of production method over the estimated life of the relevant ore body 
the lives of reserves used for accounting purposes are shorter than current reserve life determinations due to uncertainties inherent in long term estimates 
we have prepared these reserve life estimates and they have been reviewed and independently determined by mine consultants 
tons of potash and langbeinite in the proven and probable reserves are expressed in terms of expected finished tons of product to be realized  net of estimated losses 
market price fluctuations of potash or trio  as well as increased production costs or reduced recovery rates  could render proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves 
in addition  the provisions of our mineral leases  including royalties payable  are subject to periodic readjustment by the state and federal government  which could affect the economics of our reserve estimates 
significant changes in the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
inventory and long term parts inventory inventory consists of product and by product stocks which are ready for sale  mined ore  potash in evaporation ponds  which is considered work in process  and parts and supplies inventory 
product and by product inventory cost is determined using the lower of weighted average cost or estimated net realizable value and include direct costs  maintenance  operational overhead  depreciation  depletion  and equipment lease costs applicable to the production process 
direct costs  maintenance  and operational overhead include labor and associated benefits 
we evaluate production levels and costs to determine if any should be deemed abnormal and therefore excluded from inventory costs and expensed directly during the applicable period 
the assessment of normal production levels is judgmental and is unique to each period 
we model normal production levels and evaluate historical ranges of production by operating plant in assessing what is deemed to be normal 
parts inventory  including critical spares  that is not expected to be utilized within a period of one year is classified as non current 
parts and supply inventory cost is determined using the lower of average acquisition cost or estimated replacement cost 
detailed reviews are performed related to the net realizable value of parts inventory  giving consideration to quality  slow moving items  obsolescence  excessive levels  and other factors 
parts inventories that have not turned over in more than a year  excluding parts classified as critical spares  are reviewed for obsolescence and  if deemed appropriate  are included in the determination of an allowance for obsolescence 
recoverability of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if an asset s total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the related asset 
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the discounted estimated future cash flows 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates or fair values of assets may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
factors we generally will consider important and which could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of long lived assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  the denial or delay of necessary permits or approvals that would affect the utilization of our tangible assets  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of certain products by us or our customers  a decrease in estimated mineral reserves  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
although we believe the carrying values of our long lived assets were realizable as of the balance sheet dates  future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
asset retirement obligation all of our mining properties involve certain reclamation liabilities as required by the states in which they operate or by the blm 
reclamation costs are initially recorded as a liability associated with the asset to 
table of contents be reclaimed or abandoned  based on applicable inflation assumptions and discount rates 
the accretion of this discounted liability is recognized as expense over the life of the related assets  and the liability is periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimates of either the time or the amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs 
these asset retirement obligations are reviewed and updated at least annually with any changes in balances recorded as adjustments to the related assets and liabilities 
the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
planned turnaround maintenance each operation typically shuts down periodically for maintenance 
the new mexico operations have historically shut down for up to two weeks to perform turnaround maintenance 
generally  the moab and wendover operations cease harvesting potash from our solar ponds during one or more summer months to make the most of the evaporation season 
during these summer turnarounds  annual maintenance is performed 
the costs of maintenance turnarounds are considered part of production costs and are absorbed into inventory in the period incurred 
income taxes we are a subchapter c corporation and therefore are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized in full  such determinations are subject to ongoing assessment 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by recording expense using the fair value of the awards at the time of grant 
we have recorded compensation expense associated with the issuance of non vested restricted shares of common stock  non vested performance units  and non qualified stock options  all of which are subject to service conditions 
the expense associated with such awards is recognized over the service period associated with each issuance 
performance units are also subject to operational performance or market based conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations may be impacted by commodity prices  geographic concentration  changes in interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity prices potash and trio  our principal products  are commodities but are not traded on any commodity exchange 
as such  direct hedging of the prices for future production cannot be undertaken 
generally  we do not enter into long term sales contracts with customers  so prices vary with each particular transaction and the individual bids that we receive 
our potash is marketed for sale into three primary markets the agricultural market as a fertilizer  the industrial market as a component in drilling fluids for oil and gas exploration  and the animal feed market as a nutrient 
prices will vary based upon the demand from these different markets 
our net sales and profitability are determined principally by the price of potash and trio and  to a lesser extent  by the price of natural gas and other commodities used in the production of potash and langbeinite 
the price of potash and trio is influenced by agricultural demand and the prices of agricultural commodities 
decreases in agricultural demand or agricultural commodity prices could reduce our agricultural potash and trio sales 
if natural gas and oil prices were to decline enough to result in a reduction in drilling activity  our industrial potash sales would decline 
our costs and capital investments are subject to market movements in other commodities such as natural gas  electricity  steel  and chemicals 
we have entered into derivative transactions for the purchase of natural gas in the past 
as of december   we had no natural gas derivative contracts 
geographic concentration we primarily sell potash into the regions that include agricultural areas west of the mississippi river  oil and gas exploration areas in the rocky mountains and the permian basin  and animal feed production throughout the united states 
our potash mines and many of our customers are concentrated in the western half of united states and are  therefore  affected by weather and other conditions in this region 
interest rate fluctuations our former senior credit facility required us to fix a portion of our interest rate exposure through the use of derivatives when we have long term debt outstanding 
although we currently have no long term debt outstanding  we left in 
table of contents place certain derivative contracts that were entered into at a time when we did have long term debt outstanding 
all of these derivative contracts expired in  thus we had no derivative contracts outstanding as of december  we typically have low balances of accounts receivable denominated in canadian dollars and  as a result  we have minimal direct foreign exchange risk 
there is an indirect foreign exchange risk as described below 
the united states imports the majority of its potash from canada and russia 
if the canadian dollar and the russian ruble strengthen in comparison to the us dollar  foreign suppliers realize a smaller margin as measured in their local currencies unless they increase their nominal us dollar prices 
strengthening of the canadian dollar and russian ruble therefore tend to support higher us potash prices as canadian and russian potash producers attempt to maintain their margins 
however  if the canadian dollar and russian ruble weaken in comparison to the us dollar  foreign competitors may choose to lower prices significantly to increase sales volumes while maintaining margins as measured in their local currencies 
a decrease in the average net realized sales price of our potash would adversely affect our operating results
