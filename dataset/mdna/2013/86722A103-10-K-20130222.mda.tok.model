this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and certain other financial data that is prepared using non gaap measures 
for a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap components  see non gaap financial measures at the end of this item 
overview suncoke energy  inc suncoke energy  company  we  our and us is the largest independent producer of high quality coke in the americas  as measured by tons of coke produced each year  and has more than years of coke production experience 
coke is a principal raw material in the blast furnace steelmaking process 
coke is generally produced by heating metallurgical coal in a refractory oven  which releases certain volatile components from the coal  thus transforming the coal into coke 
we have designed  developed and built  and own and operate five cokemaking facilities in the united states us and designed and operate one cokemaking facility in brazil under licensing and operating agreements on behalf of our customer 
our newest us cokemaking facility in middletown  ohio commenced operations in october bringing our total us cokemaking capacity from approximately million tons of coke per year to approximately million tons of coke per year 
the cokemaking facility that we operate in brazil has cokemaking capacity of approximately million tons of coke per year 
we have a preferred stock investment in the project company that owns the brazil facility 
our cokemaking ovens utilize efficient  modern heat recovery technology designed to combust the coal s volatile components liberated during the cokemaking process and use the resulting heat to create steam or electricity for sale 
this differs from by product cokemaking which seeks to repurpose the coal s liberated volatile components for other uses 
we have also constructed the only greenfield cokemaking facilities in the united states in the last years and are the only north american coke producer that utilizes heat recovery technology in the cokemaking process 
we believe that heat recovery technology has several advantages over the alternative by product cokemaking process  including producing higher quality coke  using waste heat to generate steam or electricity for sale and reducing environmental impact 
our granite city facility and the first phase of our haverhill facility  or haverhill  include steam generation facilities which use hot flue gas from the cokemaking process to produce steam 
the steam is sold to third parties pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements 
our middletown facility and the second phase of our haverhill facility  or haverhill  include cogeneration plants that use the hot flue gas created by the cokemaking process to generate electricity 
the electricity is either sold into the regional power market or to ak steel pursuant to energy sales agreements 
we own and operate coal mining operations in virginia and west virginia that sold approximately million tons of metallurgical coal including internal sales to our cokemaking operations and million tons of thermal coal in 
table of contents incorporated in delaware in and headquartered in lisle  illinois  we became a publicly traded company in and our stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol sxc 
as discussed below  our two step separation separation from sunoco  inc sunoco was completed in our separation from sunoco on january  the distribution date  we became an independent  publicly traded company following our separation from sunoco 
our separation from sunoco occurred in two steps we were formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of sunoco 
on july  the separation date  sunoco contributed the subsidiaries  assets and liabilities that were primarily related to its cokemaking and coal mining operations to us in exchange for shares of our common stock 
as of such date  sunoco owned percent of our common stock 
on july   we completed an initial public offering ipo of  shares of our common stock  or percent of our outstanding common stock 
following the ipo  sunoco continued to own  shares of our common stock  or percent of our outstanding common stock 
on the distribution date  sunoco made a pro rata  tax free distribution the distribution of the remaining shares of our common stock that it owned in the form of a special stock dividend to sunoco shareholders 
sunoco shareholders received of a share of common stock for every share of sunoco common stock held as of the close of business on january   the record date for the distribution 
after the distribution  sunoco ceased to own any shares of our common stock 
formation of a master limited partnership on january   we completed the initial public offering of a master limited partnership the partnership through the sale of  common units of limited partner interests in the partnership in exchange for million of net proceeds 
of these net proceeds  million was retained by the partnership for environmental remediation capital expenditures and million for sales discounts related to tax credits owed to our customers 
upon the closing of the partnership offering the partnership offering  we own the general partner of the partnership  which consists of a percent ownership interest and incentive distribution rights  and we currently own a percent interest in the partnership 
the key assets of the partnership are percent of our interests in each of our haverhill and middletown cokemaking and heat recovery facilities 
the operations of the partnership will be consolidated in our results 
we are also party to an omnibus agreement pursuant to which we will provide remarketing efforts to the partnership upon the occurrence of certain potential adverse events under our coke sales agreements  indemnification of certain environmental costs and preferential rights for growth opportunities 
in connection with the closing of the partnership offering  we repaid million of our term loan and entered into an amendment to our credit agreement 
the partnership issued million of senior notes and entered into a million revolving credit facility 
for a more detailed discussion see liquidity and capital resources 
key financial results total revenues in increased percent to  million primarily due to the addition of our middletown operations which contributed million to the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily driven by higher sales in our jewell coke and other domestic coke segments due to the pass through of higher coal prices and transportation costs 
higher sales in our coal mining segment  which reflect higher coal prices and increased volumes  also contributed to the increase 
net income attributable to stockholders was million in compared to million in the increase was due to the contribution of our middletown facility and the strong performance of our cokemaking operations  offset by an increase in our interest cost as a stand alone financial structure and decreased performance from our coal mining segment 

table of contents adjusted ebitda was million in compared to million in due primarily to the same factors driving the increase in net income discussed above 
cash generated from operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase is due primarily to a full year of production at middletown in as compared to the period 
additionally  changes in working capital  including a decline in inventory in  further contributed to the increase 
our focus in in  we executed on our commitments and made progress in laying the foundation for future growth 
we delivered solid performance across our cokemaking operations including the start up of our middletown facility 
we also took actions in our coal operations to address challenges caused by weak demand and a low price environment 
in  we generated cash from operating activities of million and achieved adjusted ebitda of million 
further  we have positioned our business for future growth with the signing of an agreement to form a cokemaking joint venture in india with visa steel limited  filing a permit application to potentially build a new us cokemaking facility and pursuing our plans for an initial public offering of a master limited partnership 
our strategies and accomplishments were as follows execute the startup of our middletown cokemaking operations and achieve full production 
achieve targeted domestic coke production volume of to million tons through continued focus on operational excellence  including safety and environmental stewardship  at all facilities 
continue permitting work for a potential new us plant in anticipation of a market recovery 
continue pursuing and exploring opportunities to profitably expand our cokemaking presence in global markets with a focus on india 
improve efficiency of mining operations and implement cost reduction plans to navigate the difficult industry environment 
pursue an initial public offering of a master limited partnership for a portion of our cokemaking business 
execute the ramp up of our middletown cokemaking operations and achieve full production 
we successfully executed the start up of our middletown  ohio cokemaking facility and reached full production in the first quarter of  ahead of schedule 
the facility consists of ovens which have a cokemaking capacity of thousand tons of coke per year and a cogeneration facility which generates  on average  approximately megawatts of electricity per hour 
in  the middletown facility produced thousand tons of coke  which is in excess of percent capacity utilization  and contributed million and million to revenues and adjusted ebitda  respectively 
achieve targeted domestic coke production volume of to million tons through continued focus on operational excellence  including safety and environmental stewardship  at all facilities 
during  we produced million tons of coke  exceeding both percent capacity utilization and our domestic coke production target of to million tons 
in addition  the coal to coke yield performance improved at all our domestic cokemaking facilities  contributing positively to results 
operating our cokemaking facilities reliably and at low cost  while producing consistently high quality coke  is critical to maintaining the satisfaction of existing customers and our ability to grow with new and existing customers 
we have continued to achieve reliable and cost efficient operation of our facilities through the suncoke way  a standardized processes  procedures and management system incorporating best practices 
we believe the suncoke way provides the foundation to achieve operational excellence at our facilities and is essential to our future growth 
our expertise at developing  constructing and operating our facilities will enable us to continue growing with current and new customers  as they construct new blast furnaces and their existing cokemaking facilities require replacement 

table of contents we are also committed to maintaining a safe work environment and ensuring strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations at our cokemaking and coal mining operations 
to support these objectives  we have implemented the core components of a structured safety and environmental process and will continue to build upon this and other processes to create a robust framework for managing and monitoring safety and environmental performance 
for example  our coal mining operations safety performance was in the first quartile of us coal mining companies in we also seek to foster good relationships with regulators  policymakers  state and local officials and the communities in which we operate 
continue permitting work for a potential new us plant in anticipation of market recovery 
we are currently discussing opportunities for developing new heat recovery cokemaking facilities with domestic steel companies 
such cokemaking facilities could be either wholly owned or developed through other business structures 
as applicable  our steel making customers would be expected to purchase coke production under long term  take or pay contracts 
we expect such future facilities would also generate steam  or electrical power  which could either be sold to the steel customer or into the local power market 
during  we focused on the design  engineering and planning work required for a potential new cokemaking facility with ovens and approximately thousand tons of capacity 
this potential new facility may serve multiple customers while also reserving a portion of its capacity for opportunistic spot market coke sales 
we submitted a permit application in kentucky for this potential facility in december and will seek customer commitments once the permit has been received while continuing to assess alternative sites in other states 
we anticipate receiving our permit in late or early our ability to construct a new facility and to enter into new commercial arrangements is dependent upon market conditions in the steel industry 
the partnership has preferential rights to purchase our interest in this potential facility upon the completion of construction at a price sufficient to provide us with a return on our invested capital equal to our weighted average cost of capital plus percent 
continue pursuing and exploring opportunities to profitably expand our cokemaking presence in global markets  with a focus on india 
during  we actively researched a number of coke business opportunities in india 
as part of this effort  we announced our plan to form a cokemaking joint venture with visa steel limited in india called visa suncoke limited 
visa suncoke limited will be comprised of visa steel s thousand metric ton heat recovery cokemaking facility  and the facility s associated steam generation units 
upon closing  we will acquire a percent interest in the joint venture  with visa steel holding the remaining percent 
we believe this joint venture enables us to better pursue future opportunities to grow in india and other emerging markets 
we plan to close the transaction in the first quarter of by making an investment of approximately million  subject to customary closing conditions 
improve efficiency of coal operations and implement cost reduction plans 
when we began  our initial strategy was to expand production at our jewell underground coal mining operations 
however  coal market conditions deteriorated throughout and are expected to remain weak in as we progressed through  our strategy shifted and we implemented plans to reduce costs and increase productivity in our coal operations 
these plans included idling certain high cost mines  consolidating our labor force and equipment into more productive  lower cost mines  relocating mine sections in our largest mine and implementing deep cut mining plans as permits are received 
simultaneously  we deferred our expansion plans for our jewell underground mines and substantially all the capital expenditures associated with the expansion plan 
jewell coal mining production was million tons in and we do not anticipate increasing production in in june  we entered into a series of coal transactions with revelation energy  llc revelation 
under a contract mining agreement  revelation will mine approximately million tons of coal reserves at our jewell coal mining operations of which million tons is included in our current proven and probable reserve 
table of contents estimate as of december  mining began in the first quarter of  resulting in approximately thousand tons of production which was lower than expected as a result of permitting delays for a portion of the reserves 
we expect the remaining tons to be mined between and and anticipate percent of production to be mid volatility metallurgical coal and percent to be thermal coal 
in conjunction with the revelation agreement  we intended to build a train coal loading facility  however we have deferred the project and are providing load out services to revelation from our existing facilities 
we are evaluating alternatives to this load out facility in conjunction with the potential construction of a new coal preparation plant for our jewell coal mining operations 
pursue an initial public offering of a master limited partnership 
on july   our board of directors approved the formation of a master limited partnership the partnership and the filing of a registration statement to affect the initial public offering of common units representing limited partner interests in the partnership 
on january   we completed the initial public offering of a master limited partnership through the sale of  common units of limited partner interests in the partnership in exchange for million of net proceeds 
of these net proceeds  million was retained by the partnership for environmental remediation capital expenditures and million to pay sales discounts related to tax credits owed to our customers 
the partnership will benefit from favorable partnership tax treatment and is expected to result in a lower cost of capital which could provide us with a potential advantage to grow the business 
for a more detailed discussion of the partnership  see formation of a master limited partnership 
our focus and outlook for in  our primary focus will be to sustain momentum established at our cokemaking facilities 
execute initiatives at indiana harbor and certain of our other domestic cokemaking facilities 
pursue domestic and international opportunities to grow the coke business 
optimize coal assets to enhance long term strategic flexibility 
taking into account the effects of the ipo of our master limited partnership  we expect net income attributable to suncoke energy  inc to be in the range of million to million  diluted earnings per share attributable to suncoke energy  inc stockholders to be in the range of to and total adjusted ebitda to be in the range of million to million 
this compares to net income of million  diluted earnings per share attributable to suncoke energy  inc stockholders of and total adjusted ebitda of million 
we expect cash from operations in of approximately million 
our capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  consisting of million of on going capital expenditures  million for the refurbishment of the indiana harbor facility and million in environmental remediation capital 
sustain momentum at our cokemaking facilities 
given our strong cokemaking operations in and the growth initiatives we are pursuing  we expect our cokemaking business to maintain its positive momentum over the long term 
in we expect to produce in excess of million tons of coke  again exceeding percent capacity utilization 
under the take or pay provisions of our contracts  the cost of coal used to make coke for our customers is passed through to them subject to certain yield standards 
if we exceed those standards  we recognize the benefit of using less coal to produce the same amount of coke but still get to bill our customer based on the contracted coal to coke yield standard 
as coal prices decline  coal to coke yield benefits also decline as the coal prices passed through to customers is less and therefore the benefit of exceeding the contracted yield standard is less 
due to lower 
table of contents expected coal prices in  we expect less benefit from better coal to coke yields  although this will be partially offset by sustained strong domestic cokemaking performance  meaningful improvement at our indiana harbor facility and the absence of start up costs and higher operating expense recovery at our middletown facility 
despite this reduced benefit we expect adjusted ebitda per ton from our cokemaking operations of between and in  consistent with levels 
execute initiatives at indiana harbor and certain of our other domestic cokemaking facilities 
the initial term of our coke sales agreement at indiana harbor ends on september  in preparation for negotiation of a new long term contract  we conducted an engineering study to identify major maintenance projects necessary to preserve the production capacity of the facility 
in accordance with the findings of the study  we originally estimated that we would spend approximately million 
based on discussions with our customer regarding their requirements for the potential contract renewal term  we now estimate that we could spend as much as million 
we spent million related to this project in and anticipate spending million in while we believe there is a reasonable likelihood that we will reach agreement with our customer for a new long term contract  such an agreement may not be reached 
we expect to earn a reasonable return on our investment  and consequently the actual level of capital expenditures may depend upon the terms of an eventual agreement with our customer and dte energy company  the third party investor owning a percent interest in the partnership the indiana harbor partnership that owns the indiana harbor cokemaking facility 
in addition  we believe the project scope will address items that may be required in connection with the settlement of the novs at our indiana harbor facility 
see the section entitled business legal and regulatory requirements environmental matters and compliance 
our customer also has a contractual relationship to purchase steam and electricity from cokenergy  inc cokenergy  an independent power producer that owns and operates an energy facility  including heat recovery equipment  a flue gas desulfurization system and a power generation plant  that processes hot flue gas from the indiana harbor partnership s facility to produce steam and electricity and to reduce the sulfur and particulate content of such flue gas 
the indiana harbor partnership also has an agreement with cokenergy under which the indiana harbor facility supplies flue gas to cokenergy and cokenergy processes such flue gas 
the agreement between the indiana harbor partnership and cokenergy ends on september  in the first six months of the final year of the agreement between the indiana harbor partnership and cokenergy  the parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith for an extension to the term of the agreement 
in the event that the parties cannot reach agreement on an extension of the term of the agreement  and subject to the rights of our customer to purchase the energy facility from cokenergy  the indiana harbor partnership may purchase certain assets  specifically the flue gas desulfurization system and heat recovery equipment  necessary for the continued operation of the indiana harbor cokemaking facility from cokenergy at fair market value upon written notice to cokenergy not later than six months prior to the expiration of the agreement 
to the extent the indiana harbor partnership does not exercise such right  cokenergy  at its option  may either abandon or remove all or any of the heat recovery equipment of the energy facility 
we have undertaken capital projects to improve the reliability of the energy recovery systems and enhance environmental performance at our haverhill and granite city cokemaking facilities 
as a result of discussions with the epa  we spent approximately million related to these projects in and expect to spend approximately million in and an additional million in the to timeframe  million of which is to be funded with a portion of the proceeds from the partnership offering 
the final cost of the projects will be dependent upon the ultimate outcome of discussions with regulators 
we are currently engaged in penalty negotiations with regulators and estimate our probable loss to be approximately million 
for more information  see the section entitled business legal and regulatory requirements environmental matters and compliance 

table of contents pursue domestic and international opportunities to grow the coke business 
in  we expect to continue to explore ways to grow our coke business both domestically and abroad 
we expect to obtain a permit for our next potential us facility in kentucky in late or early and are working to identify and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities for the partnership in the us and canada 
we plan to close the visa suncoke joint venture in the first quarter of and are continuing to work to identify potential follow on international opportunities  focusing initially on india 
we believe that the efficiencies we have developed from our experience as the leading independent us coke producer and our proven ability to provide a reliable supply of coke make us well suited to purchase or operate facilities  including by product cokemaking facilities  currently operated by steelmakers or others that would prefer to utilize the capital committed to such equipment for other purposes 
according to cru  in  there was approximately million tons of cokemaking capacity in the u 
s 
and canada unaffiliated with us  of which percent was owned by steel producers and percent was owned by merchant providers 
we may acquire  make investments in or enter into commercial arrangements with respect to existing cokemaking facilities in order to opportunistically capture market share in the united states and canada 
optimize coal assets to enhance long term strategic flexibility 
during  we will continue to reposition our mining operations to address near term market weakness and enhance long term strategic flexibility 
in the first quarter of  we continued with our plan to reduce costs and increase productivity and implemented a reduction in force 
this reduction in force resulted in the termination of employees eligible to receive certain payments resulting in expected restructuring charges of million during in addition  we have and will continue to take several actions to reduce costs and increase productivity as previously discussed 
coal mining production was million tons in and we do not anticipate increasing production in in the fourth quarter of  we negotiated coal sale contracts for and expect average sales prices in our coal mining segment to decrease by approximately to per ton 
as a result of these factors  we expect adjusted ebitda for our coal mining segment to be in the range of break even to a loss of million for items impacting comparability middletown project execution 
we successfully executed the start up of our middletown  ohio cokemaking facility in october and reached full production in the first quarter of  ahead of schedule 
total costs of the project were approximately million 
for the year ended december   the middletown cokemaking facility produced thousand tons of coke and contributed million and million to revenues and adjusted ebitda  respectively 
for the year ended december   the middletown cokemaking facility produced thousand tons of coke and contributed million and million to revenues and adjusted ebitda  respectively 
unreimbursed costs and start up costs of million  of which million related to start up activities in the first quarter of  are included in the results of operations for the year ended december  beginning in  we expect an increase in the recovery of operating costs at middletown as the operating fee transitions from a fixed amount per ton to a budgeted amount per ton based on the full recovery of expected operating maintenance costs 
indiana harbor 
on september   we acquired the percent interest held by an affiliate of ge capital in the partnership that owns the indiana harbor facility for million 
as a result of this transaction  we now hold an percent interest in the partnership 
the remaining percent interest in the partnership is owned by an affiliate of dte energy company 
the change in ownership percentage contributed million and million to net income attributable to suncoke energy  inc for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we clarified the interpretation of certain contract and billing items with our customer 
as a result  coal spilled during the coke oven charging process pad coal may not be subsequently reused for making coke for this customer  unless it is included in the coal blend at zero 
table of contents cost 
the company recorded expense of approximately million for the year ended december  related to these contract and billing issues 
the company reached an agreement to settle its contract and billing issues with arcelormittal during the fourth quarter of and reversed million of the million charge recorded in for the year ended december   the company recorded approximately million in lower of cost or market adjustments on existing pad coal inventory  and is currently remarketing this pad coal to other customers 
corporate separation transactions 
prior to the distribution date  our operating expenses included allocations of certain general and administrative costs of sunoco for services provided to us by sunoco 
during  we replaced most services provided by sunoco and developed the internal functions  such as financial reporting  tax  regulatory compliance  legal  corporate governance  treasury  internal audit and investor relations  necessary to fulfill our responsibilities as a stand alone public company 
allocations from sunoco were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  we incurred million in nonrecurring operating expense related to headquarter relocation costs and costs associated with hiring key senior management personnel during the year ended december  loss on firm purchase commitments 
during  we estimated that indiana harbor would fall short of its annual minimum coke production requirements by approximately thousand tons 
accordingly  we entered into contracts to procure approximately thousand tons of coke from third parties 
however  the coke prices in the purchase agreements exceeded the sales price in our contract with arcelormittal 
this pricing difference resulted in an estimated loss on firm purchase commitments of million million attributable to net parent investment and million attributable to noncontrolling interest  all of which was recorded during the first quarter of in the remainder of  the company recorded lower of cost or market adjustments of million million attributable to suncoke energy  inc net parent investment and million attributable to noncontrolling interests on this purchased coke 
in the second quarter of  the company sold thousand tons of this coke to arcelormittal 
operational improvements at indiana harbor subsequent to the first quarter of increased coke production for the balance of  and indiana harbor was able to meet its contractual requirements with arcelormittal 
in the third quarter of  the company entered into an agreement to sell approximately thousand tons of this purchased coke to a customer on a consignment basis that will expire  as amended  on the earlier of april  or full consumption of  and payment for  the coke 
the customer did not consume any coke in fiscal the customer consumed approximately thousand tons of consigned coke during and the remaining thousand tons during january black lung obligations 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  which was implemented in  amended previous legislation related to coal workers black lung obligations 
ppaca provides for the automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and changes the legal criteria used to assess and award claims 
our obligation related to black lung benefits is estimated based on various assumptions  including actuarial estimates  discount rates  and changes in health care costs 
the impact of ppaca in as well as  changes in discount rates and other assumptions  increased our black lung benefit obligation by approximately million and million during and  respectively 
resolution of contract disputes with arcelormittal 
beginning in july  arcelormittal initiated legal proceedings challenging the prices charged to arcelormittal under the jewell coke sales agreement 
in january  we participated in court ordered mediation with arcelormittal which resulted in a commercial resolution of the litigation 
the parties agreed to amend the jewell and haverhill coke sales agreements effective january  to eliminate the fixed coal cost adjustment factor in the jewell agreement and increase the operating cost and fixed fee components of the coke price under both agreements 
the parties also agreed that the take or pay provisions of these coke sales agreements would remain in effect through the end of the terms of these agreements in december 
table of contents prior to the settlement  these take or pay provisions were scheduled to change in the second half of into annually adjusted provisions that would have only required arcelormittal to purchase coke from us for its projected requirements above certain fixed thresholds 
this extension provides us a guaranteed outlet for coke production through we also expect that the settlement will significantly reduce the concentration of our profitability in the jewell coke sales agreement 
for example  with our middletown facility in full production  none of our coke sales agreements constitute more than approximately percent of our overall operating income excluding corporate overhead costs  whereas the jewell coke sales agreement accounted for nearly percent of such income in if the amendments to the coke supply agreements had been in place during  the pretax earnings of the jewell coke segment would have been reduced by approximately million and the pretax earnings of our haverhill facility included in the other domestic coke segment would have been increased by approximately million 
we also entered into a settlement agreement with arcelormittal to resolve the indiana harbor arbitration claims 
this settlement was effective january and will not significantly impact our future income 
acquisition of hkcc companies 
in january  we acquired the hkcc companies and its affiliated companies for approximately million  consisting of net cash payment of million and contingent consideration of million 
hkcc has million tons of proven and probable coals reserves located in russell and buchanan counties in virginia  contiguous to our existing metallurgical coal mining operations 
while lower production levels are anticipated in the short term due to unfavorable coal market conditions  this acquisition has the ability to produce between thousand and thousand tons of coal production annually  with the potential to expand production in the future 
hkcc contributed revenues and gross margin of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  and contributed million and million to revenues and gross margin  respectively  for the year ended december  financing activities 
prior to the ipo  our primary source of liquidity was cash from operations and borrowings from sunoco 
our funding from sunoco was through floating rate borrowings from sunoco  inc r m  a wholly owned subsidiary of sunoco 
the agreements between sunoco and the company related to these borrowings terminated concurrent with the ipo and all outstanding advances were settled 
prior to the separation date  we also earned interest income on million in notes receivable from the claymont investment company claymont  a then wholly owned subsidiary of sunoco 
in connection with the separation  sunoco contributed claymont to suncoke energy 
as a result  we no longer earn interest income for these notes  as the balances and related interest are eliminated in our consolidated results 
for periods prior to the separation date  interest income exceeded interest expense 
between july  through december   suncoke energy issued million in debt 
for periods subsequent to the separation date  interest expense exceeded interest income

our total revenues  net of sales discounts  were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the corresponding period of our middletown facility contributed million to the increase in revenues 
the remaining increase was primarily driven by higher sales in our jewell coke and other domestic coke segments due to the pass through of higher coal prices and transportation costs 
also contributing to the revenue increase was higher sales in our coal mining segment  due primarily to higher coal prices and increased volumes 
sales price discounts provided to our customers in connection with sharing of nonconventional fuel tax credits were million and million for and  respectively 
costs and operating expenses 
total operating expenses were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the corresponding period of our middletown facility contributed million to the increase in operating expenses 
the remaining increase in cost of products sold and operating expenses was driven by increased coal and coke volumes and higher coal mining costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased slightly in due to favorable comparison to the prior year  which included start up costs related to our middletown operations and restructuring charges related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  offset partially by higher legal costs  increased headcount and higher share based compensation expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased due to the

total operating expenses were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the corresponding period of the increase in cost of products sold and operating expenses was driven by higher purchased coal costs  increased coal and coke volumes and higher coal mining costs 
sg a expense increased million in due to higher corporate expenses associated with public company readiness  increased headcount and relocation costs and higher pre start up middletown costs 
sg a expenses in included legal fees and settlement charges related to the resolution of the jewell coke contract amendments and a settlement agreement with arcelormittal that resolved indiana harbor arbitration claims 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased due to the addition of the middletown cokemaking facility  the acquisition of hkcc and higher depreciation at our granite city facility due to prior year capital expenditures 
financing expense income  net 
net financing expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million in net financing income for the year ended december  the period reflects million of interest expense associated with the issuance of debt and a million decrease in interest income from claymont  a former sunoco subsidiary  offset by a million increase in capitalized interest related to capital projects 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company used its external interest rate as a basis for capitalizing interest  which was higher than historical rates 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the corresponding period of our effective tax rate was percent and percent  respectively 
our effective tax rate  after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling 
table of contents interests  and excluding tax credits and the effects of the indiana and illinois statutory rate changes recorded during the second and third quarters of  was percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the corresponding period of our effective tax rate  excluding the items referenced above  was higher for the year ended december  compared to december  largely due to the loss of the manufacturer s deduction for federal income tax purposes 
we were not able to utilize this tax benefit in because we had a federal net operating loss for tax purposes 
nonconventional fuel tax credits increased million to million for the period from million in the same period of driven by increased production from the granite city and haverhill cokemaking facilities 
results of reportable business segments we report our business results through four segments jewell coke consists of our cokemaking operations located in vansant  virginia  other domestic coke consists of our indiana harbor  haverhill and granite city cokemaking and heat recovery operations located in east chicago  indiana  franklin furnace  ohio and granite city  illinois  respectively 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  our other domestic coke segment included our middletown  ohio facility  international coke consists of our operations in vit ria  brazil  where we operate a cokemaking facility for a brazilian subsidiary of arcelormittal  and coal mining consists of our metallurgical coal mining activities conducted in virginia and west virginia 
in addition  we have included the results of the hkcc companies that we acquired in january in this segment from the date of acquisition 
our coke sales agreements in our jewell coke and other domestic coke segments contain highly similar contract provisions 
specifically  each agreement includes take or pay provisions 
substantially all of our current coke sales are under take or pay contracts that require us to produce the contracted volumes of coke and require the customer to purchase such volumes of coke up to a specified tonnage maximum or pay the contract price for any tonnage they elect not to take 
as a result  our ability to produce the contracted coke volume and performance by our customers are key determinants of our profitability 
we do not have any significant spot coke sales  accordingly  spot prices for coke do not generally affect our revenues 
coal cost component with pass through provisions 
the largest cost component of our coke is the cost of purchased coal  including any transportation or handling costs 
under the contracts at our cokemaking facilities in the other domestic coke segment  coal costs are a pass through component of the coke price  provided that we realize certain targeted coal to coke yields 
when targeted coal to coke yields are achieved  the price of coal is not a significant determining factor in the profitability of these facilities  although it does affect our revenue and cost of sales for these facilities in approximately equal amounts 
however  to the extent that the actual coal to coke yields are less than the contractual standard  we are responsible for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process 
conversely  to the extent our actual coal to coke yields are higher than the contractual standard  we realize gains 
as coal prices decline  the benefits associated with favorable coal to coke yields also decline 
under the jewell coke sales agreement  prior to january   the component of the coke price attributable to coal was equal to the delivered cost of coal applicable to our sales to arcelormittal from our haverhill facility increased by the application of a fixed adjustment factor 
as a result of this pricing formula  as coal prices increased  the profitability of our jewell facility increased  and as coal prices decreased  the profitability of our jewell cokemaking facility decreased 
the coal supply for our haverhill cokemaking facility has generally been purchased under contracts with terms of one to two 
table of contents years 
accordingly  these coal costs were most impacted by market prices at the time these agreements were entered into and were generally not responsive to changes in coal prices during the year 
the impact of coal prices on jewell coke profitability has therefore lagged the market for spot coal prices 
beginning january   as a result of the settlement agreement with arcelormittal discussed above  the coal component of the price of coke under the jewell coke sales agreement was amended 
the coal component of the jewell coke price will now be fixed annually for each calendar year based on the weighted average contract price of third party coal purchases at our haverhill facility applicable to arcelormittal coke sales 
to the extent that contracts for third party coal purchases at our haverhill facility convert to pricing mechanisms of less than a year  the jewell coke price will be adjusted accordingly during that year 
the fixed adjustment factor has been eliminated  and as a result  coal prices will no longer significantly affect the financial results of the jewell coke segment 
beginning in the first quarter of  the intersegment coal price charged to the jewell coke segment is reflective of the contract price jewell coke charges its customers 
prior year periods have been adjusted to reflect this change 
operating cost component with pass through or inflation adjustment provisions 
our coke prices include an operating cost component 
operating costs under three of our coke sales agreements are passed through to the respective customers subject to an annually negotiated budget in some cases subject to a cap annually adjusted for inflation  and we share any difference in costs from the budgeted amounts with our customers 
under our other two coke sales agreements  the operating cost component for our coke sales are fixed subject to an annual adjustment based on an inflation index 
accordingly  actual operating costs can have a significant impact on the profitability of all our domestic cokemaking facilities 
at middletown  our actual coal to coke yields were lower than the contractual standard in due to the start up of operations  which lowered operating income by million 
coal to coke yields at middletown were near break even in due to improved performance in the second half of the year 
fixed fee component 
our coke prices also include a per ton fixed fee component for each ton of coke sold to the customer and is determined at the time the coke sales agreement is signed and is effective for the term of each sales agreement 
tax component 
our coke sales agreements also contain provisions that generally permit the pass through of all applicable taxes other than income taxes related to the production of coke at our facilities 
coke transportation cost component 
where we deliver coke to our customers via rail  our coke sales agreements also contain provisions that permit the pass through of all applicable transportation costs related to the transportation of coke to our customers 
our domestic coke facilities have also realized  and some continue to realize  certain federal income tax credits 
specifically  energy policy legislation enacted in august created nonconventional fuel tax credits for us federal income tax purposes pertaining to a portion of the coke production at our jewell cokemaking facility  all of the production at our haverhill and granite city cokemaking facilities and all future domestic cokemaking facilities placed into service by january  the credits cover a four year period  effective the later of january  or the date any new facility is placed into service prior to january  the credits attributable to production from the second phase of our haverhill expired in june of and those attributable to production at our granite city facility will expire in september of in  and  the value of these credits was approximately  and per ton of coke produced at facilities eligible to receive credits  respectively 
we have shared a portion of the tax credits with ak steel for sales from the second phase of our haverhill facility and continue to share a portion of the tax credits with us steel for sales from our granite city facility  through discounts to the sales price of coke 
we received federal income tax credits for coke production from the second phase of our haverhill facility through june  and are currently receiving federal income tax credits for coke production from our granite city cokemaking facility 
to the extent sunoco ultimately utilizes federal income tax credits for coke 
table of contents production for which it qualified prior to the distribution  we expect to share a portion of the value of such credits with our customers  but we will not receive the benefits of such credits on our consolidated federal income tax return pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into in connection with our separation from sunoco 
sales price discounts provided to our customers in connection with sharing of nonconventional fuels tax credits  which are reflected in the operating results of the other domestic coke segment  totaled million  million and million in the  and periods  respectively 
following the distribution  we will share a portion of the tax credits when we utilize the benefits of such credits on our consolidated federal income tax return 
as a result of these discounts  our pretax results for these facilities reflect the impact of these sales discounts  while the actual tax benefits are reflected as a reduction of income tax expense 
accordingly  when the tax credits expire  the results of our other domestic coke segment will increase  but this increase will be more than offset by the increase in our income tax expense 
revenues from our international coke segment are derived from licensing and operating fees based upon the level of production from a brazilian subsidiary of arcelormittal 
our revenues also include the full pass through of the operating costs of the facility 
we also receive an annual preferred dividend on our preferred stock investment in the brazilian project company that owns the facility 
in general  the facility must achieve certain minimum production levels for us to receive the preferred dividend 
recently we have reduced production at our brazilian cokemaking facility at the request of our customer 
these decreases to production do not impact the receipt of our preferred dividend 
revenues from our coal mining segment are generated largely from sales of coal to the jewell cokemaking facility for conversion into coke 
some coal is also sold to our other domestic cokemaking facilities 
coal sales to third parties have historically been limited  but they have increased as a result of the hkcc acquisition and our contract mining arrangement with revelation 
intersegment coal revenues for sales to the jewell coke and other domestic coke segments are based on prices that third parties or coke customers of the other domestic coke segment have agreed to pay for our coal and which approximate the market price for this quality of metallurgical coal 
most of the coal sales to these third parties and facilities are under contracts with one to two year terms  and as a result coal revenues lag the market for spot coal prices 
accordingly  the revenues from the coal mining segment are most affected by the timing of the execution of coal sales agreements with third parties or the customers of our other domestic coke segment 
coal production costs are the other critical factor in the financial results of the coal mining segment 
overhead expenses that can be identified with a segment have been included as deductions in determining operating results of our business segments  and the remaining expenses have been included in corporate and other 
management believes adjusted ebitda is an important measure of operating performance and is used as the primary basis for the chief operating decision maker codm to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments

analysis of segment results year ended december  compared to year ended december  jewell coke sales and other operating revenue sales and other operating revenue increased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in the pass through of higher coal costs and higher volumes contributed million and million  respectively  to the increase in segment sales and other operating revenues in the remaining million increase was primarily driven by higher pass through of transportation costs and increased operating expense recovery 
adjusted ebitda beginning in the first quarter of  the intersegment coal price charged to the jewell coke segment is reflective of the contract price jewell coke charges its customers 
prior year periods have been adjusted to reflect this change 
adjusted ebitda from our jewell coke segment increased million  or percent  to million for compared to million for more favorable coal to coke yields increased adjusted ebitda by million for the remaining million increase relates primarily to a lower allocation of corporate costs for as compared to depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  increased million  from million in to million in other domestic coke sales and other operating revenue sales and other operating revenue increased million  or percent  to  million in compared to  million in our middletown facility commenced operations in the fourth quarter of and contributed million to the increase in sales for excluding middletown  the increase was mainly attributable to higher pricing driven by the pass through of higher coal costs  which contributed million of the increase 
approximately million of the increase was related to higher fees for the reimbursement of operating and transportation costs

capacity utilization in was percent  an increase from percent in  which favorably impacted volume and sales at each of our facilities 
decreased sales discounts due to the expiration of federal income tax credits at our haverhill facility in june increased revenues approximately million in revenues in also benefited approximately million from the settlement of a billing dispute with arcelormittal during the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in energy pricing  which lowered sales and other operating revenue by million for adjusted ebitda other domestic coke adjusted ebitda increased million  or over percent  to million for compared to million in the contribution of our middletown facility increased adjusted ebitda by million for the middletown results included approximately million of unreimbursed costs  million of which is associated with start up activities in the first quarter of excluding middletown  adjusted ebitda increased million 
increased coal cost recovery of million and increased operating cost recovery of million  which was primarily driven by improved performance at our indiana harbor and granite city facilities  contributed primarily to the increase 
increased volumes contributed an additional million to the increase in adjusted ebitda and the settlement of a billing dispute with arcelormittal during the fourth quarter of also contributed an additional million when compared to the prior period 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million primarily related to decreased energy sales due primarily to lower pricing and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses due primarily to an increase in legal costs 
depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  increased million  to million in  from million in  primarily due to the impact of middletown operations and accelerated depreciation taken on certain assets due to a change in their estimated useful lives 
international coke sales and other operating revenue sales and other operating revenue decreased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in due to a decrease in volumes of thousand tons  or percent  partially offset by higher pass through of operating costs 
the decrease in volumes was due to a request from our customer and does not impact our ability to receive our preferred dividend 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda in the international coke segment decreased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to higher legal costs  decreased volumes  an unfavorable comparison to prior year due to an operating expense reimbursement in this was partially offset by increased operating expense recovery 
depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  was insignificant in both and coal mining sales and other operating revenue total sales and other operating revenue  including intersegment sales  increased by million  or percent  to million in compared to million in the increase in sales and other operating revenue is due to an increase in coal sales price per ton of  or percent  to in  from in additionally  volume increased thousand tons  or percent  for 
table of contents third party sales in increased million  or percent  to million in from million in due primarily to an increase in volume of thousand tons  or percent 
pricing for third party sales was essentially flat in as compared to sales and other operating revenue is historically generated largely from sales of coal to the jewell cokemaking facility and our other domestic cokemaking facilities 
beginning in the first quarter of  intersegment coal revenues for sales to jewell coke are reflective of the contract price jewell coke charges its customer 
prior year periods have been adjusted to reflect this change 
intersegment sales increased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in due mainly to an increase in price to per ton in from per ton in internal sales volumes increased thousand tons  or percent  in as compared to  contributing marginally to the increase 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda decreased million  or percent  to million in from million in the decrease in adjusted ebitda was driven primarily by higher average coal cash production costs per ton caused by increased reject rates early in the year  increased labor costs due to higher wage rates and the implementation of a new bonus program and higher royalty and trucking payments 
the remainder of the decrease was primarily related to lower sales of hi volatile and thermal coal  despite increased overall volumes and selling prices 
coal cash production costs per ton increased over the prior year due to a change in the mix of coal produced  with hi volatile and thermal coals representing a smaller portion of production in the current year 
because mid volatile coal is generally more costly to mine as compared to hi volatile and thermal coal production  our shift toward mid volatile production in response to weaker hi volatile and thermal market conditions increased the average cash production cost per ton in the current year 
these decreases to adjusted ebitda were partially offset by an increase in the favorable fair value adjustment related to our hkcc contingent consideration arrangement of million  from million in to million in the combined impact of these factors resulted in coal production costs increasing to per ton in from per ton in and coal cash production costs increasing to per ton in from per ton in depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  increased million  from million in to million in due primarily to capital expenditures for mining equipment in the prior year 
corporate and other corporate expenses decreased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in the decrease in corporate expenses was driven by lower relocation costs of million  increased allocations of corporate costs of million  decreased consulting and outside service cost of million and favorable comparison to the prior year period which included approximately million of start up costs related to our middletown operations 
these decreases were partially offset by increased costs of million primarily related to share based compensation expense and increased incentive compensation expense in depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  increased million  from million in to million in the increase in depreciation is primarily due to increased capital expenditures in the current period  partially offset by accelerated depreciation and asset write offs resulting from our corporate headquarters relocation in the prior year 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  jewell coke sales and other operating revenue sales and other operating revenue decreased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in comparability between periods was impacted by the arcelormittal contract amendments 
as a result of the amendments  the absence of the fixed adjustment factor decreased sales revenue by million while higher operating cost and fixed fee components from the amendments increased sales revenues by million over the prior year period 
the combination of these factors resulted in a net decrease of million over the prior year period 
sales revenue further decreased million due to decreased external sales in compared to the prior year period 
these factors were partially offset by higher average coal and transportation costs and an increase in tons sold to arcelormittal  which increased sales revenue by million  million and million  respectively 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda from our jewell coke segment decreased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in comparability between periods is impacted by the arcelormittal contract amendments  which decreased segment earnings by million 
beginning in the first quarter of  the intersegment coal price charged to the jewell coke segment is reflective of the contract price jewell coke charges its customers 
prior year periods have been adjusted to reflect this change 
internal coal transfer pricing increased from per ton in to per ton in  subsequent to the transfer price adjustment referenced above  and negatively impacted jewell coke segment earnings by million  with a corresponding increase in the earnings of the coal mining segment 
other items  including the absence of attractively priced spot coke sales that occurred in the prior year  the consolidated elimination of intersegment coke sales in the prior period and higher operating expenses in the current period further reduced segment earnings by an aggregate of million 
excluding the impact of these spot coke sales and intersegment coke sales  the impact of volume changes on adjusted ebitda was flat 
the impact to earnings due to these higher coal costs and other items was partially offset by million of higher revenues  primarily due to the pass through of higher coal prices 
depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  increased million  from million in to million in other domestic coke sales and other operating revenue sales and other operating revenue increased million  or percent  to  million in compared to million in the start up of middletown operations in the fourth quarter of contributed million to the increase in sales 
excluding middletown  the increase was mainly attributable to higher pricing driven by the pass through of higher coal costs  which contributed million of the increase 
higher fixed fee revenue and fees for the reimbursement of operating costs contributed million to sales revenue 
coke sales volumes also increased thousand tons  or percent  in compared to  which contributed million of the increase 
capacity utilization in was percent and increased from percent in increased capacity utilization at indiana harbor and granite city favorably impacted volume and sales  including energy sales 
sales decreased by million in due to a resolution of certain contract and billing issues with our customer at indiana harbor 

table of contents adjusted ebitda other domestic coke adjusted ebitda increased million  or percent  to million for compared to million in the start up of middletown operations in the fourth quarter of decreased adjusted ebitda by million 
excluding middletown  increases in adjusted ebitda attributable to contract changes and steam sales were partially offset by decreased recovery of coal and operating costs primarily due to indiana harbor results in the first quarter of sales discounts also increased million  which are excluded from adjusted ebitda 
haverhill contract changes increased operating cost reimbursement and fixed fee revenue by million in higher steam and power sales increased segment earnings by million 
these increases were partially offset by lower results at indiana harbor 
during the first three months of  we estimated that indiana harbor would fall short of its annual minimum coke production requirements by approximately thousand tons 
we entered into contracts to procure the coke from third parties to meet the projected volume shortfall 
however  the coke prices in the purchase agreements exceeded the sales price in our contract with arcelormittal 
this pricing difference resulted in an estimated loss on firm purchase commitments of million million attributable to net parent investment and million attributable to noncontrolling interest  all of which was recorded during the first three months of during the balance of the year  we recorded lower of cost or market adjustments totaling million million attributable to suncoke energy stockholders equity and million attributable to noncontrolling interests on the purchased coke 
operational improvements at indiana harbor resulting from maintenance and repairs at this facility increased volume during the second  third and fourth quarters such that coke production at indiana harbor was sufficient to meet contractual requirements with arcelormittal 
additionally  higher maintenance and repair costs to address oven reliability issues of approximately million  which was not recoverable from our customer  lowered recovery of operating costs in finally  the resolution of certain contract and billing issues with our customer at indiana harbor decreased adjusted ebitda by million in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  which was driven primarily by settlement and legal cost incurred at indiana harbor in  which was slightly offset by a change in the corporate allocation methodology for granite city 
depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  increased million  from million in to million in international coke sales and other operating revenue sales and other operating revenue decreased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in sales and other operating revenue decreased due to lower operating and license fees driven by a percent decrease in coke production  partially offset by a higher pass through of operating costs 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda in the international coke segment decreased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to lower licensing and operating fees and higher selling  general and administrative expenses in partially offset by the absence of currency transaction losses recognized in depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  was insignificant in both and

prior year periods have been adjusted to reflect this change 
the increase in adjusted ebitda was driven by higher sales offset by higher operating costs of million 
our existing mining operations contributed million of the increase in operating costs 
this increase was driven by increasing reject rates due to variations in the thickness and quality of coal seams  lower productivity due to labor shortages for experienced miners and regulatory compliance requirements  incremental costs associated with training  higher wage rates and implementation of a new bonus program to retain skilled mine employees  and higher royalty payments 
hkcc further contributed million in operating costs  which also included a million favorable fair value adjustment related to the hkcc contingent consideration arrangement that requires the company to pay the former owners of hkcc per ton of coal for each ton produced from the real property or leased property acquired by hkcc if production levels exceed thousand tons in a calendar year for a period of years or until full exhaustion  whichever comes sooner 
this fair value adjustment decreased coal production costs by per ton 
lower volumes of purchased coal improved adjusted ebitda by million 
increased selling  general and administrative expenses of million related to the acquisition of hkcc and capital expenditures further decreased adjusted ebitda for compared to finally  coal cash production costs absorbed in inventory increased million for compared to the combined impact of these factors resulted in coal production costs increasing from per ton in to per ton in and coal cash production costs increasing from per ton in to per ton in depreciation expense  which is not included in segment profitability  increased million  from million in to million in due primarily to the acquisition of hkcc

liquidity and capital resources prior to the separation date  our primary source of liquidity was cash from operations and borrowings from sunoco 
our funding from sunoco had been through floating rate borrowings from sunoco  inc r m  a wholly owned subsidiary of sunoco 
the agreements between sunoco and the company related to these borrowings terminated concurrent with the ipo and all outstanding advances were settled pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement described in note to the combined and consolidated financial statements 
concurrently with the ipo  suncoke energy also entered into the credit agreement dated as of july  that provides for a seven year term loan in a principal amount of million the term loan  repayable in equal quarterly installments at a rate of percent of the original principal amount per year  with the balance payable on the final maturity date 
additionally  the credit agreement provides for up to million in uncommitted incremental facilities the incremental facilities that are available subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
on december   we borrowed an additional million term loan as part of the incremental facilities 
as of december   there was million of capacity under the incremental facilities 
we have million outstanding under the term loan as of december  the credit agreement also provided for a five year million revolving facility the revolving facility 
the proceeds of any loans made under the revolving facility could be used to finance capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we utilized the revolving facility to fund the completion and start up of our middletown facility 
we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility as of december  concurrently with the ipo  suncoke energy issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes the notes that bear interest at a rate of percent per annum and will mature in with all principal paid at maturity 
during the year ended december   net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and term loan were million  which reflected a discount reduction of million and debt issuance costs and fees of million 
the net proceeds were used to repay certain intercompany indebtedness to sunoco of million and for general corporate purposes 
following the separation date  our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash from operations and borrowings under the debt financing arrangements described above 
in connection with the closing of the partnership offering  we repaid million of our term loan  and entered into an amendment to our credit agreement 
the partnership issued million of senior notes partnership notes and entered into a million revolving credit facility

coal inventory levels were higher in due to increased purchases in the third quarter in response to force majeure events experienced by multiple coal suppliers in the first half of this decrease in inventory was partially offset by decreases in accounts payable due primarily to lower inventory purchases 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to increases in working capital in largely due to an increase in coal inventory  an increase in coke inventory to meet the projected shortfall at indiana harbor and higher receivables  offset partly by higher accounts payable related to inventory purchases 
the increase in coal inventory was due in part to the start up of middletown operations  which contributed million to the increase 
the remaining increase was in the other domestic coke segment and was primarily due to an increase in coal inventory volume that resulted from additional purchases made in the third quarter in response to tightness in coal supply due to force majeure events experienced by coal suppliers in the first and second quarters of lower net income also contributed to the decrease in cash flow from operations 
the year ended december  included a reduction in working capital largely attributable to lower receivables balances from a customer that deferred payment at december  cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  the prior year period included capital expenditures of million related to the construction of our middletown facility and million net cash used for the acquisition of the hkcc companies 
the current year period includes million of environmental remediation capital expenditures as well as million of expansion capital expenditures at indiana harbor 
in addition  a million payment to complete the hkcc acquisition was made in cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher capital expenditures primarily associated with the construction of the middletown facility and the acquisition of the hkcc companies

our capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  of which ongoing capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately million 
ongoing capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and or to extend their useful lives 
ongoing capital expenditures also include new 
table of contents equipment that improves the efficiency  reliability or effectiveness of existing assets 
ongoing capital expenditures do not include normal repairs and maintenance expenses  which are expensed as incurred 
in  we anticipate spending million for the refurbishment of the indiana harbor facility and million in environmental remediation capital to enhance the environmental performance at our haverhill and granite city cokemaking operations 
our business is capital intensive  requiring capital to fund the construction or acquisition of assets and to maintain such assets 
the level of future capital expenditures will depend on various factors  including market conditions and customer requirements  and may differ from current or anticipated levels 
material changes in capital expenditures levels may impact financial results  including but not limited to the amount of depreciation  interest expense and repair and maintenance expense 
investments in december  we announced our plan to form a cokemaking joint venture with visa steel limited in india 
the joint venture will be named visa suncoke limited and will be comprised of visa steel s heat recovery coke plant  which produces thousand metric tons of coke per year  and the plant s associated steam generation units 
we will acquire a percent interest in the joint venture  while visa steel will hold the remaining percent 
we expect this transaction to close in early and expect to invest approximately million in this joint venture 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  payment due dates total thereafter dollars in millions total debt principal interest operating leases purchase obligations coal transportation and coal handling obligations supporting financing arrangements other total our operating leases include leases for office space  land  locomotives  office equipment and other property and equipment 
operating leases include all operating leases that have initial noncancelable terms in excess of one year 
transportation and coal handling services consist primarily of railroad and terminal services attributable to delivery and handling of coal purchases and coke sales 
long term commitments generally relate to locations for which limited transportation options exist and match the length of the related coke sales agreement 
represents fixed and determinable obligations to secure coal handling services at the indiana harbor cokemaking facility 
primarily represents open purchase orders for materials and supplies 
a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our principal purchase obligations in the 
table of contents ordinary course of business consist of coal and transportation and distribution services  including railroad services 
we also have contractual obligations supporting financing arrangements of third parties  contracts to acquire or construct properties  plants and equipment  and other contractual obligations  primarily related to services and materials 
most of our coal purchase obligations are based on fixed prices 
these purchase obligations generally include fixed or minimum volume requirements 
transportation and distribution obligations also typically include required minimum volume commitments 
the purchase obligation amounts in the table above are based on the minimum quantities or services to be purchased at estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions 
accordingly  the actual amounts may vary significantly from the estimates included in the table 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the arrangements described in note to the combined and consolidated financial statements  the company has not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off balance sheet liabilities 
impact of inflation although the impact of inflation has slowed in recent years  it is still a factor in the us economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace properties  plants  and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and existing agreements  we have generally passed along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees and we expect to continue this practice 
critical accounting policies a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to the combined and consolidated financial statements 
our management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of our combined and consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions consist of properties  plants and equipment  retirement benefit liabilities  black lung benefit obligations  and deferred income taxes 
although our management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ to some extent from the estimates on which our combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared at any point in time 
despite these inherent limitations  our management believes the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and combined and consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our financial condition 
properties  plants and equipment the cost of plants and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives of assets which are depreciated on a straight line basis are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in the expected physical life of the asset  its planned use  technological advances  or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
changes in useful lives that do not result in the impairment of an asset are recognized prospectively 
the lease and mineral rights are capitalized and amortized to operations as depletion expense using the units of production method 
normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
amounts incurred that extend an asset s useful life  increase its productivity or add production capacity are capitalized 
direct costs  such as outside labor  materials  internal payroll and benefit costs  incurred during the construction of a new facility are capitalized  indirect costs are not capitalized 
repairs and maintenance costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents long lived assets  other than those held for sale  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  among other factors operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines  changes in the expected physical life of an asset  technological developments resulting in obsolescence  changes in demand for our products or in end use goods manufactured by others utilizing our products as raw materials  changes in our business plans or those of our major customers  suppliers or other business partners  changes in competition and competitive practices  uncertainties associated with the united states and world economies  changes in the expected level of capital  operating or environmental remediation expenditures  and changes in governmental regulations or actions 
additional factors impacting the economic viability of long lived assets are described under cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements 
a long lived asset that is not held for sale is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount 
such estimated future cash flows are highly subjective and are based on numerous assumptions about future operations and market conditions 
the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the impaired asset 
it is also difficult to precisely estimate fair market value because quoted market prices for our long lived assets may not be readily available 
therefore  fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets being reviewed for impairment 
we have had no significant asset impairments during the years ended december   and retirement benefit liabilities pension benefit liabilities 
we have obligations totaling million in connection with a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
during we contributed million to this plan 
effective january   benefits under this plan were frozen for all eligible participants 
in addition  we have obligations totaling million in connection with postretirement welfare benefit plans that provide health care benefits for substantially all of our current retirees 
medical benefits under these plans were also phased out or eliminated for most non mining employees with less than years of service on january  our future contributions for these plans will also be subject to an annual cap for all those who are still eligible for these benefits 
the postretirement welfare benefit plans are unfunded and have historically been paid by us subject to deductibles and coinsurance that have been the responsibility of retirees 
the principal assumptions that impact the determination of both expense and benefit obligations for our pension plan is the discount rate and the long term expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate are the principal assumptions that impact the determination of expense and benefit obligations for our postretirement health care benefit plans 
however  the impact of the health care trend rate has been greatly mitigated by the cap on our contributions 
we determine the discount rates for our pension and other postretirement welfare benefit obligations on the measurement date by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to each plans estimated future benefit payments 
the present values of our future pension and other postretirement welfare obligations were determined using discount rates of and percent  respectively  at december  and and percent  respectively  at december  our expense under these plans is generally determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the year  or using a weighted average rate when curtailments  settlements and or other events require a plan remeasurement 
the weighted average discount rate for the pension plan was  and percent for  and  respectively 
the weighted average discount rate for postretirement welfare plans was  and percent for  and  respectively 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was assumed to be percent for and percent for each of and during the second quarter of  the pension plan s investment strategy and target asset allocation for non cash investments were modified to implement an allocation of 
table of contents percent to equity securities and percent to investment grade fixed income securities 
the objective of this strategy is to maximize the long term return on plan assets at a prudent level of risk in order to ensure adequate funding for the company s pension benefit obligations 
prior to this change  the plan s investment strategy for reflected a percent allocation to investment grade fixed income securities with a weighted average duration approximately equal to the plan s benefit obligation 
following this change in asset allocation  the plan s expected return on assets increased from percent to percent and resulted in a reduction of defined benefit plan expense of million for fiscal a long term expected rate of return of percent on plan assets is anticipated to be used to determine our pension expense for the expected rate of return on plan assets is estimated utilizing a variety of factors including the historical investment return achieved over a long term period  the targeted allocation of plan assets and expectations concerning future returns in the marketplace for both equity and fixed income securities 
the long term expected rate of return for reflects the year compound average of simulated expected returns of the portfolio described above based on market conditions as of the beginning of and reflects blended reversion to long term normative assumptions 
in determining pension expense  we apply the expected rate of return to the fair market value of plan assets at the beginning of the year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption 
it generally will differ from the actual annual return  which is subject to considerable year to year variability 
in and  our pension plan assets were invested in a trust with the assets of other pension plans of sunoco 
per the separation and distribution agreement  these assets were separated from the sunoco trust in january and were transferred to a newly formed trust established for our pension plan 
for  the pension plan assets generated a positive return of percent compared to a return of percent for and a return of percent in for the year period ended december   the compounded annual investment return on our pension plan assets was a positive return of percent 
while the year period return is below our long term expected rate of return for fiscal  we believe that this is largely a result of the negative return during  which was one of the worst asset return periods in history as a result of the financial crisis in the second half of that year 
as permitted by existing accounting rules  we do not currently recognize in pension expense the difference between the expected and actual return on assets 
rather  the difference along with other actuarial gains or losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plans primarily the discount rate and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience are fully recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
if such actuarial gains and losses on a cumulative basis exceed percent of the projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets  if larger  the excess is amortized into net income as a component of pension or postretirement welfare benefits expense generally over the average remaining service period of plan participants still employed with us  which currently is approximately years for the pension plans and approximately years for the postretirement welfare benefit plans 
at december   the accumulated net actuarial loss gain for defined benefit and postretirement welfare benefit plans was million and million  respectively 
other post employment benefit liabilities 
we also have unrecognized prior service benefits attributable to our postretirement benefit plans of approximately million at december   which is primarily attributable to the phase down or elimination of retiree medical benefits described above 
most of the benefit of this liability reduction will be amortized into income through the initial health care cost trend assumptions used to compute the accumulated postretirement welfare benefit obligation were increases of percent  percent and percent at december   and  respectively 
these trend rates were assumed to decline gradually to percent in as of december  and december  and to percent in as of december   the trend assumption remains at that level thereafter 

table of contents set forth below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement welfare benefits expense and benefit obligations that would occur in from a change in the indicated assumptions change in rate expense benefit obligations dollars in millions pension benefits decrease in the discount rate decrease in the long term expected rate of return on plan assets postretirement welfare benefits decrease in the discount rate increase in the annual health care cost trend rates represents both the increase in accumulated benefit obligation and the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plan and the accumulated postretirement benefit welfare obligations for our postretirement welfare benefit plans 
certain expense and benefit obligation changes are less than million and are not reflected in the table 
black lung benefit liabilities we have obligations related to coal workers pneumoconiosis  or black lung  benefits to certain of our employees and former employees and their dependents 
such benefits are provided for under title iv of the federal coal mine health and safety act of and subsequent amendments  as well as for black lung benefits provided in the states of virginia  kentucky and west virginia pursuant to workers compensation legislation 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  which was implemented in  amended previous legislation related to coal workers black lung obligations 
ppaca provides for the automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and changes the legal criteria used to assess and award claims 
we act as a self insurer for both state and federal black lung benefits and adjust our liability each year based upon actuarial calculations of our expected future payments for these benefits 
charges against income for black lung benefits amounted to million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
our independent actuaries annually calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated black lung liability based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined based on a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds with maturities that are consistent with the estimated duration of our black lung obligations 
for the years ended december   and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability was  and percent respectively 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would have increased coal workers black lung expense by million 
the estimated liability recognized in our financial statements at december  and was million and million  respectively 
changes in actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and mortality assumptions  increased our black lung obligation by approximately million at december  for the year ended december   we paid black lung benefits of approximately million 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  deferred income taxes prior to the distribution date  suncoke energy and certain subsidiaries of sunoco were included in the consolidated federal and certain consolidated  combined or unitary state income tax returns filed by sunoco 
however  suncoke energy s provision for income taxes and the deferred income tax amounts reflected in the combined and consolidated financial statements have been determined on a theoretical separate return basis 

table of contents prior to the separation date  any current federal and state income tax amounts were settled with sunoco under a previous tax sharing arrangement 
under this previous tax sharing arrangement  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards generated on a theoretical separate return basis could be used to offset future taxable income determined on a similar basis 
such benefits were reflected in the company s deferred tax assets  notwithstanding the fact that such net operating losses and tax credits may actually have been realized on sunoco s consolidated income tax returns  or may be realized in future sunoco consolidated income tax returns for periods through the distribution date 
our consolidated balance sheets as of december  included deferred income taxes assets net of valuation allowances attributable to tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards  determined on a theoretical separate return basis  totaling million 
on the separation date  suncoke energy and sunoco entered into a new tax sharing agreement that governs the parties respective rights  responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits  tax attributes  the preparation and filing of tax returns  the control of audits and other tax proceedings and other matters regarding taxes 
under the tax sharing agreement  certain deferred tax assets attributable to net operating losses and credit carry forwards  which had been reflected in suncoke energy s balance sheets prior to the separation date on a standalone theoretical basis  are no longer realizable by suncoke energy 
accordingly  after the separation date  current and deferred tax benefits totaling million were eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding reduction in suncoke energy s equity accounts  million and million of which were eliminated in the year ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   suncoke energy estimates that all tax benefits have been settled under the provisions of the tax sharing agreement 
suncoke energy will continue to monitor the full utilization of all tax attributes when the respective tax returns are filed and will  consistent with the terms of the tax sharing agreement  record additional adjustments when necessary 
any additional adjustments will be recorded through income 
we are currently receiving federal income tax credits for coke production from our granite city cokemaking facility and received credits from the second phase of our haverhill cokemaking facility through june  these tax credits are earned for each ton of coke produced and sold and expire four years after the initial coke production at the facility 
the tax credit eligibility for coke production from the second phase of the haverhill facility expired in june and the tax credit eligibility for coke production from the granite city facility will expire in september in  and  the value of the credits was approximately per ton  per ton and per ton of coke produced at facilities eligible to receive credits  respectively 
we share with our customers a portion of the value of these credits  when utilized  through sales discounts to their respective coke prices 
sales discounts provided to our customers were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
to the extent sunoco ultimately utilizes federal income tax credits for coke production for which it qualified prior to the distribution  we expect to share a portion of the value of such credits with our customers but  pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into in connection with our separation from sunoco  we will not receive the benefits of such credits on our consolidated federal income tax return 
at december   we had million accrued related to sales discounts that had not yet been shared with our customers 
see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information 
arrangements between sunoco and suncoke energy  inc in connection with the ipo  suncoke energy and sunoco entered into certain agreements that effected the separation of suncoke energy s business from sunoco  provided a framework for its relationship with sunoco after the separation and provided for the allocation between suncoke energy and sunoco of sunoco s assets  employees  liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to  at and after suncoke energy s separation from sunoco 

table of contents separation and distribution agreement 
on the separation date  suncoke energy and sunoco entered into the separation and distribution agreement  which set forth the agreements between suncoke energy and sunoco regarding the principal corporate transactions required to effect suncoke energy s separation from sunoco  the ipo and the distribution  if any  of suncoke energy s shares to sunoco s shareholders  and other agreements governing the relationship between sunoco and suncoke energy 
the separation and distribution agreement identified assets to be transferred  liabilities to be assumed and contracts to be assigned to each of suncoke energy and sunoco as part of the separation of sunoco into two companies 
except as expressly provided  all assets were transferred on an as is  where is basis 
in general  each party to the separation and distribution agreement assumed liability for all pending  threatened and unasserted legal matters related to its own business or its assumed or retained liabilities and will indemnify the other party for any liability to the extent arising out of or resulting from such assumed or retained legal matters 
in addition  the separation and distribution agreement provides for cross indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of suncoke energy s business with suncoke energy and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of sunoco s business with sunoco 
the separation and distribution agreement allocates responsibility with respect to certain employee related matters  particularly with respect to sunoco employee benefit plans in which any suncoke energy employees participate or suncoke energy employee benefit plans which hold assets in joint trusts with sunoco 
in addition  the separation and distribution agreement provides for certain adjustments with respect to sunoco equity compensation awards that occurred when sunoco completed the distribution 
tax sharing agreement 
on the separation date  suncoke energy and sunoco entered into a tax sharing agreement that governs the parties respective rights  responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits  tax attributes  the preparation and filing of tax returns  the control of audits and other tax proceedings and other matters regarding taxes 
for a detailed discussion of the tax sharing agreement  see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements 
transition services agreement 
on the separation date  suncoke energy and sunoco entered into a transition services agreement in connection with the separation 
pursuant to the transition services agreement  sunoco provides certain support services to suncoke energy  including  among others  information technology  treasury  risk management and insurance  tax  internal audit and various other corporate services  in each case consistent with the services provided by sunoco to suncoke energy before the separation 
the charges for the transition services generally are intended to allow sunoco to fully recover the costs directly associated with providing the services  plus all out of pocket costs and expenses  generally without profit 
the services provided under the transition services agreement will terminate at various times specified in the agreement generally terminating upon completion of the distribution on january  
as of december   most services provided under this agreement have terminated  with the exception of certain information technology services and other de minimis support 
suncoke energy may terminate certain or the remaining specified services by giving prior written notice to sunoco of such services and paying any applicable termination charge 
guaranty  keep well  and indemnification agreement 
on the separation date  suncoke energy and sunoco entered into a guaranty  keep well  and indemnification agreement 
under this agreement  suncoke energy guarantees the performance of certain obligations of its subsidiaries  prior to the date that sunoco or its affiliates may become obligated to pay or perform such obligations  including the repayment of a loan from indiana harbor coke company lp  indemnifies  defends  and holds sunoco and its affiliates harmless against all liabilities relating to these obligations  and restricts the assets  debts  liabilities and business activities of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries  so long as certain obligations of such subsidiary remain unpaid or unperformed 
in addition  suncoke energy releases sunoco from its guaranty of payment of a promissory note owed by one of its subsidiaries to another of its subsidiaries 

table of contents recent accounting standards there are no recently issued accounting standards which are not yet effective that we believe would materially impact our financial statements 
non gaap financial measures in addition to the gaap results provided in the annual report on form k  we have provided a non gaap financial measure  adjusted ebitda 
reconciliation from gaap to the non gaap measurement is presented below 
our management  as well as certain investors  uses this non gaap measure to analyze our current and expected future financial performance 
this measure is not in accordance with  or a substitute for  gaap and may be different from  or inconsistent with  non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda adjusted for sales discounts and the interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization attributable to equity earnings in our unconsolidated affiliates 
ebitda reflects sales discounts included as a reduction in sales and other operating revenue 
the sales discounts represent the sharing with customers of a portion of nonconventional fuels tax credits  which reduce our income tax expense 
however  we believe our adjusted ebitda would be inappropriately penalized if these discounts were treated as a reduction of ebitda since they represent sharing of a tax benefit that is not included in ebitda 
accordingly  in computing adjusted ebitda  we have added back these sales discounts 
our adjusted ebitda also includes ebitda attributable to our unconsolidated affiliates 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or operating income under gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses 
management believes adjusted ebitda is an important measure of the operating performance of the company s net assets 
adjusted ebitda does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined by gaap  and calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies 
we believe adjusted ebitda is an important measure of operating performance and provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance 
adjusted ebitda is a measure of operating performance that is not defined by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income as determined in accordance with gaap 
set forth below is additional detail as to how we use adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating performance  as well as a discussion of the limitations of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool 
operating performance 
our management uses adjusted ebitda in a number of ways to assess our combined financial and operating performance  and we believe this measure is helpful to management in identifying trends in our performance 
adjusted ebitda helps management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on financial results 
accordingly  we believe this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely our cost structure and expenses 
limitations 
other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently then we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda also has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations include that adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  does not reflect changes in  or cash requirement for  working capital needs  
table of contents does not reflect our interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on or principal payments of our debt  does not reflect certain other non cash income and expenses  excludes income taxes that may represent a reduction in available cash  and includes net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
we explain adjusted ebitda and reconcile this non gaap financial measure to our net income  which is its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap

all forward looking statements included in this annual report on form k are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary areas of market risk include changes in the price of coal  which is the key raw material for our cokemaking business and a product of our coal mining business  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
in our coal mining segment  we expect to sell approximately million tons of coal in including transfers to our cokemaking operations 
although we have historically had limited third party sales from our coal mining operations  we generally sell coal pursuant to contracts with terms similar to the terms of the contracts pursuant to which we buy coal from third parties  including pricing 
for  approximately percent of our projected sales are committed at established selling prices 
accordingly  increases and decreases in the market price of metallurgical coal can significantly impact our coal mining segment results 
for our other domestic coke segment  the largest component of the price of our coke is coal cost 
however  under the coke sales agreements at all of our other domestic coke cokemaking facilities  coal costs are a pass through component of the coke price  provided that we are able to realize certain targeted coal to coke yields 
as such  when targeted coal to coke yields are achieved  the price of coal is not a significant determining factor in the profitability of these facilities 
beginning january   as a result of a settlement agreement with arcelormittal  the coal component of the price of coke under the jewell coke sales agreement was amended 
the coal component of the jewell coke price will now be fixed annually for each calendar year based on the weighted average contract price of third party coal purchases at our haverhill facility applicable to arcelormittal coke sales 
to the extent that contracts for third party coal purchases at our haverhill facility convert to pricing mechanisms of less than a year  then the jewell coke price will be adjusted accordingly during that year 
the fixed adjustment factor has been eliminated  and as a result  coal prices will no longer significantly affect the financial results of the jewell coke segment 
the provisions of our coke sales agreements require us to meet minimum production levels and generally require us to secure replacement coke supplies at the prevailing contract price if we do not meet contractual minimum volumes 
because market prices for coke are generally highly correlated to market prices for metallurgical coal  to the extent any of our facilities are unable to produce their contractual minimum volumes we are subject to market risk related to the procurement of replacement supplies
