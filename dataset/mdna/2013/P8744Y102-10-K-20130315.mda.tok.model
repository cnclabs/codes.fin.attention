item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto starting on page f of this annual report on form k 
overview steiner leisure limited is a worldwide provider and innovator in the fields of health  wellness and education 
we operate our business through four reportable segments spa operations  products  schools and laser hair removal 
through our spa operations segment  we offer massages and a variety of other body treatments  as well as a broad variety of beauty treatments to women  men and teenagers on cruise ships and at land based spas 
we conduct our activities pursuant to agreements with cruise lines and owners of our land based venues that  generally  give us the exclusive right to offer these types of services at those venues 
the cruise lines and land based venue owners  generally  receive compensation based on a percentage of our revenues at these respective locations and  in certain cases  a minimum annual rental or combination of both 
as of february   we provided our spa services on ships and at a total of hotel spas located in the united states  the caribbean  asia  the pacific and other locations  and at our day spas in new york city two spas  coral gables and london 
in january  we completed the acquisition of the assets of onboard 
onboard provided spa services and sold spa products on cruise ships  five of which had large spa facilities 
in connection with this transaction  the principal owners of onboard entered into consulting and non competition agreements with us 
the purchase price of this acquisition was million  including contingent consideration 
through our products segment  we develop and sell a variety of high quality beauty products under our elemis  la th rapie  bliss  rem de and laboratoire rem de brands  and also sell products of third parties  both under our packaging and labeling and otherwise 
the ingredients for these products are produced for us by several suppliers  including premier european manufacturers 
we sell our products at our shipboard and land based spas pursuant to the same agreements under which we provide spa services at those locations  as well as through third party outlets and our catalogs and websites 
on december   we acquired all of the stock of bliss inc from starwood 
bliss inc is a spa and skincare company with urban hotel and land based spa locations  offering services under the bliss and rem de brands and products under the bliss and laboratoire rem de brands 
bliss inc also operates an e commerce and catalog business and distributes its products through bloomingdale  harrods  harvey nichols  macy  neiman marcus  nordstrom  saks fifth avenue and other department stores  ulta and sephora stores and other domestic and international retail locations  as well as qvc 
the purchase price for bliss inc was million in cash  less cash acquired 
in connection with this acquisition  bliss and rem de spas and amenities will remain exclusive to starwood in the hotel category at w hotels and st 
regis hotels  respectively 
through our schools segment  we own and operate post secondary schools comprised of a total of campuses located in arizona  colorado  connecticut  florida  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  nevada  new jersey  pennsylvania  texas  utah  virginia and washington 
these schools offer programs in massage therapy and  in some cases  beauty and skin care  and train and qualify spa professionals for health and beauty positions 
among other things  in conjunction with skin care programs  we train the students at our schools in the use of our elemis  bliss and la th rapie products 
we offer full time programs as well as part time programs for students who work or who otherwise desire to take classes outside traditional education hours 
revenues from our massage and beauty schools  which consist almost entirely of student tuition payments  are derived to a significant extent from the proceeds of loans issued under the title iv programs  authorized by title iv of the hea and administered by the doe 
we must comply with a number of regulatory requirements in order to maintain the eligibility of our students and prospective students for loans under these programs 
new rules of the doe  effective july   increased our regulatory compliance obligations  have adversely affected our schools segment enrollments and continue to adversely affect our enrollment and our results of operations 
on november   we acquired the assets of cortiva 
cortiva operates seven post secondary massage therapy schools from campuses located in arizona  florida  illinois  massachusetts  new jersey  pennsylvania and washington 
steiner  through its schools division  now owns and operates a total of campuses in states with a total population of approximately  students as of february  the purchase price for this transaction was million payable in cash at closing  less cash acquired 
the purchase price was paid from existing cash 
through our laser hair removal segment  we offer a non invasive procedure for the removal of unwanted facial and body hair in a clinical setting 
on november   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of ideal image 
ideal image is a leader in the growing consumer healthcare category of laser hair removal 
as a result of our acquisition of ideal image  we operate laser hair removal treatments centers and are party to agreements with franchisees  who operate laser hair removal centers offering services under the ideal image brand in an upscale retail setting 
ideal image is subject to regulation in the states in which its facilities are located  related to  among other things  corporate entities such as ideal image practicing medicine and to the provision of the laser hair removal services 
the purchase price for this transaction was million payable in cash  less cash acquired  and was paid from existing cash and common shares and through borrowings under a credit facility entered into at the time of the acquisition 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated from our cruise ship operations 
accordingly  our success and our growth are dependent to a significant extent on the success and growth of the travel and leisure industry in general  and on the cruise industry in particular 
our hotel land based spas are dependent on the hospitality industry for their success 
these industries are subject to significant risks  more fully described above  that could affect our results of operations 
the success of the cruise and hospitality industries  as well as our business  is impacted by economic conditions 
the economic slowdown experienced in recent years in the united states and other world economies have created a challenging environment for the cruise and hospitality industries and our business  including our retail beauty products sales 
while economic conditions have shown some improvement  a number of european countries continue to experience adverse economic conditions related to unpaid debt obligations of certain of those countries 
the impact on consumers of periodic increases in fuel costs have added to the continuation of this economic turmoil 
as a consequence of these economic conditions  our results of operations and financial condition for  and were adversely affected 
a worsening of the more severe aspects of the economic slowdown or continuing increases in fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on our services and product sales 
the cruise industry also is subject to risks specific to that industry 
among other things  the highly publicized january accident involving the costa concordia adversely affected cruise ship bookings and the highly publicized february carnival triumph fire could also adversely affect cruise ship bookings in and thereafter 
other factors also can adversely affect our financial results 
the us dollar has been weak in recent years against the uk pound sterling and the euro 
this weakness affected our results of operations because we pay for the administration of recruitment and training of our shipboard personnel and the ingredients and manufacturing of many of our products in uk pounds sterling and euros  respectively 
key performance indicators spa operations 
a measure of performance we have used in connection with our periodic financial disclosure relating to our cruise line operations is that of revenue per staff per day 
in using that measure  we have differentiated between our revenue per staff per day on ships with large spas and other ships we serve 
our revenue per staff per day has been affected by the continuing requirement that we place additional non revenue producing staff on ships with large spas to help maintain a high quality guest experience 
we also utilize  as a measure of performance for our cruise line operations  our average revenue per week 
we use these measures of performance because they assist us in determining the productivity of our staff  which we believe is a critical element of our operations 
with respect to our land based spas  we measure our performance primarily through average weekly revenue over applicable periods of time 
schools 
with respect to our massage and beauty schools  we measure performance primarily by the number of new student enrollments and the rate of retention of our students 
a new student enrollment occurs each time a new student commences classes at one of our schools 
products 
with respect to sales of our products  other than on cruise ships and at our land based spas  we measure performance by revenues 
laser hair removal 
with respect to our laser hair removal centers  we measure performance primarily through average weekly revenue and new customer acquisitions 
growth we seek to grow our business by attempting to obtain contracts for new cruise ships brought into service by our existing cruise line customers and for existing and new ships of other cruise lines  seeking new venues for our land based spas  developing new products and services  seeking additional channels for the distribution of our retail products and seeking to increase the student enrollments at our post secondary massage and beauty schools  including through the opening of new school campuses  and by opening new ideal image centers 
we also consider growth  among other things  through appropriate strategic transactions  including acquisitions and joint ventures 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
this discussion is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management judgment in their application 
the impact on our business operations and any associated risks related to these policies is discussed under results of operations  below  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will be consistent with those estimates 
cost of revenues includes cost of services  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees  an allocable portion of payments to cruise lines  an allocable portion of staff related shipboard expenses  wages paid directly to land based spa employees  payments to land based spa venue owners  spa facilities depreciation  as well as  with respect to our schools and laser hair removal centers  directly attributable campus or center  as the case may be  costs such as rent  advertising and employee wages  and cost of products  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees  an allocable portion of payments to cruise lines  an allocable portion of other staff related shipboard expenses  as well as costs associated with development  manufacturing and distribution of products 
the allocations discussed above are based on the portion of maritime revenues represented by product or service revenues 
cost of revenues may be affected by  among other things  sales mix  production levels  exchange rates  changes in supplier prices and discounts  purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies  tariffs  duties  freight and inventory costs and increases in fuel costs 
certain cruise line and land based spa agreements provide for increases in the percentages of services and products revenues and or  as the case may be  the amount of minimum annual payments over the terms of those agreements 
these payments may also be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and land based spa venue owners that replace expiring agreements 
cost of products includes the cost of products sold through our various methods of distribution 
to a lesser extent  cost of products also includes the cost of products consumed in rendering services 
this amount is not a material component of the cost of services rendered and would not be practicable to identify separately 
operating expenses include administrative expenses  salaries and payroll taxes 
in addition  operating expenses include amortization of certain intangibles relating to acquisitions 
revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when services are performed and products are delivered 
tuition revenue and revenue related to certain nonrefundable fees and charges at our massage and beauty schools are recognized monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the course of study 
at the time a student begins attending a school  a liability unearned tuition is recorded for all academic services to be provided and a tuition receivable is recorded for the portion of the tuition not paid up front in cash 
revenue related to sales of program materials  books and supplies are  generally  recognized when the program materials  books and supplies are delivered 
we include the revenue related to sales of program materials  books and supplies in the services revenue financial statement caption in our consolidated statement of income 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term  we refund the portion of the tuition already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
revenue from gift certificate sales is recognized upon gift certificate redemption and upon recognition that a certificate will never be redeemed  referred to as breakage 
we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards  and our gift cards do not have an expiration date 
based on historical redemption rates  a relatively stable percentage of gift certificates will be subject to breakage 
we use the redemption recognition method for recognizing breakage related to certain gift certificates for which we had sufficient historical information 
under the redemption recognition method  revenue is recorded pro rata over the time period gift cards are actually redeemed and breakage is recognized only if we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift certificates to government agencies under the unclaimed property laws in the relevant jurisdictions 
we determine our gift certificate breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns 
at least three years of historical data  which is updated annually  is used to determine actual redemption patterns 
gift certificate breakage income is included in revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
the company recognizes ideal image center center revenues for treatment packages sold at company owned clinic locations 
treatment packages generally provide for five initial treatments which occur at up to ten week intervals and allows for up to four additional treatments  as necessary  to obtain the desired results 
center sales revenue is recognized evenly over the average number of treatments provided 
revenues collected  net of related financing fees for unperformed services is included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts are provided based on our historical collection experience  reviewed at least annually 
we extend unsecured credit to our students for tuition and fees and we record a receivable for the tuition and fees earned in excess of the payment received from or on behalf of a student 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable using historical collection experience 
we review the historical collection experience  consider other facts and circumstances  and adjust the calculation to record an allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate 
if our current collection trends were to differ significantly from our historic collection experience  however  we would make a corresponding adjustment to our allowance 
we write off the accounts receivable due from former students when we conclude that collection is not probable 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets in question 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
for certain properties  leasehold improvements are amortized over lease terms  which include renewal periods that may be obtained at our option and that are considered significant to the continuation of our operations and to the existence of leasehold improvements  the value of which would be impaired if we discontinued our use of the leased property 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset  industry practice and asset maintenance policies 
maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  based on estimated future cash flows  that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
in certain cases  the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the assets in question 
additionally  as part of our recoverability analysis  we consider whether the existing service potential useful life of the assets within the asset group remain appropriate or require adjustment 
specifically  we consider the impact of the expected use of the assets and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  among other considerations 
as of december   we concluded no adjustment to useful lives of our long lived assets was necessary 
accounting for business combinations when accounting for business combinations  we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and or pre acquisition contingencies  all of which ultimately affect the fair value of goodwill established as of the acquisition date 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date and is then subsequently tested for impairment at least annually 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in connection with our acquisitions have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired entity and are  therefore  inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include  but are not limited to  the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  the future expected cash flows from sales of products and services and related contracts and agreements  as well as discount and long term growth rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill and intangibles goodwill and intangibles is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
as of december   we had goodwill of million and unamortized intangibles of million 
our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets with definite lives and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as consumer spending habits and general economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of each of our reporting units on an annual basis as of each january  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances 
we consider our maritime  land based spas  product distribution  schools and laser hair removal segments to be individual reporting units which are also individual operating segments of the company 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach which utilizes similar companies as the basis for the valuation 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over amounts assigned to its net assets 
the step one determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other estimates 
the fair value measurement is generally determined through the use of independent third party appraisals or an expected present value technique  both of which may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what other industry members would use to price the asset or asset group 
during the year  we monitor the actual performance of our reporting units relative to the fair value assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test  including potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions 
for the year ended december   we did not identify any triggering events which required an interim impairment test subsequent to our annual impairment test on january  as of january  and  we reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of each of our reporting units and concluded for each reporting unit that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value 
the determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other key assumptions made by management  including discount rates  utilized in the valuation of certain identifiable assets 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or in our results of operations or unforeseen negative events could adversely affect our reporting units and lead to a revision of the estimates used to calculate fair value 
these key estimates and forecasted operating results may or may not occur or may be revised by management which may require us to recognize impairment losses in the future 
with respect to our schools reporting unit step one analysis  which used the discounted cash flow approach to calculate the fair value of our reporting unit  the primary examples of key estimates include our discount rate and forecasted revenue growth rates 
as a measure of sensitivity on the discounted cash flow approach  as of january   the date of our last annual impairment test  a hypothetical change in both our discount and long term revenue growth rates would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of the schools reporting unit  or approximately of the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax exposure together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax purposes and accounting purposes  respectively 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize certain of our deferred income tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred income tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
contingent rents and scheduled rent increases our land based spas  generally  are required to pay rent based on a percentage of our revenues  with others having fixed rents 
in addition  for certain of our land based spas  we are required to pay a minimum rental amount regardless of whether such amount would be required to be paid under the percentage rent agreement 
rent escalations are recorded on a straight line basis over the term of the lease agreement 
we record contingent rent at the time it becomes probable that it will exceed the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
previously recognized rental expense is reversed into income at such time that it is not probable that the specified target will be met 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
asu adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  including disaggregating and separately presenting changes in aoci balances by component and presenting significant items reclassified out of aoci either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or as a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
it does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
the asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years  and is to be applied prospectively 
we do not currently anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or related disclosures  however  we will continue to assess through the effective date the future impact  if any  of this new accounting update to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
asu amends the guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment 
under the revised guidance  entities testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the likelihood of the indefinite lived intangible asset being impaired is below a more likely than not threshold ie  a likelihood of more than  the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset 
asu does not revise the requirement to test indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment and does not amend the requirement to test these assets for impairment between annual tests if there is a change in events or circumstances 
the amendments in this asu are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we currently do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or related disclosures  however  we will continue to assess through the effective date the future impact  if any  of this guidance on our financial condition 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  testing goodwill for impairment asu 
this new guidance allows  but does not require  an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for the purpose of determining if detailed quantitative goodwill impairment testing is necessary 
the amendments in this asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  if an entity determines  on the basis of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or related disclosures 
in june  fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu 
this guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of other comprehensive income oci or two separate  but consecutive  statements 
this asu does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
we adopted asu as of january  see our consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in united states gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
asu provides a definition of fair value to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between united states gaap and ifrs and provides clarification about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the asu also expands certain other disclosure requirements  particularly pertaining to level fair value measurements 
the amendments in this asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or related disclosures

we have experienced varying degrees of seasonality  due to the seasonality experienced by certain cruise lines  as the demand for cruises is stronger in the northern hemisphere during the summer months and during holidays  resulting in the third quarter generally being the strongest quarter for us 
our product sales generally are strongest in the third and fourth quarters as a result of the december holiday shopping period 
however  historically  the revenues of ideal image are weakest during the third quarter and  if this trend continues  this could offset to some extent the strength of our shipboard operations during the summer months 
the quarterly selected statements of income data set forth below were derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of steiner leisure which  in the opinion of our management  contain all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of those statements

our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities and  in connection with major acquisitions  financing provided by our revolving credit facility and its predecessor facilities 
we believe that cash generated from operations is sufficient to satisfy the cash required to operate our current business for at least the next months 
however  if the softening in the worldwide economy most recently  particularly in europe  and the leisure industry continues  our operating cash flow and the availability and cost of capital for our business will be adversely affected 
in addition  depending on the longevity and ultimate severity of the softness of the global economy  including financial and credit markets  our ability to grow or sustain our business operations may be significantly adversely affected 
also  as a result of concerns about the general stability of financial markets  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased  as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  imposed tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms similar to existing debt or at all  and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide any new funding 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that funding in excess of that available through our working capital and current credit facility will be available to the extent required and on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to access funding when needed on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fully implement our business plans  consummate acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities  respond to competitive pressures or refinance any debt obligations that we may incur  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

inflation and economic conditions we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our revenues or results of operations 
however  public demand for activities  including cruises  is influenced by general economic conditions  including inflation 
periods of economic softness  such as has been experienced in recent years  particularly in north america where a substantial number of cruise passengers reside  could have a material adverse effect on the cruise industry and hospitality industry upon which we are dependent  and has had such an effect in recent years 
such a slowdown has adversely affected our results of operations and financial condition in recent years 
continuance of the more severe aspects of the recent adverse economic conditions  as well as continued fuel price increases  in north america and elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition during the period of such recurrence

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had million outstanding under our term loan and revolving facility 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives based upon market conditions 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we have used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes to our borrowings 
these swaps are typically entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby reducing the risk of credit loss 
a hypothetical change in our interest rate would change our results of operations by approximately million 
while our revenues and expenses are primarily represented by us dollars  they also are represented by various other currencies  primarily the uk pound sterling and the euro 
accordingly  we face the risk of fluctuations in non us currencies compared to non us dollars 
we manage this currency risk by monitoring fluctuations in foreign currencies and  when exchange rates are appropriate  purchasing amounts of those foreign currencies 
we have mitigated the risk relating to fluctuations in the uk pound sterling and the euro through the structuring of intercompany debt 
if such mitigation proves ineffective  a hypothetical change in the aggregate exchange rate exposure of the uk pound sterling and the euro to the uk dollar as of december  would change our results of operations by approximately million
