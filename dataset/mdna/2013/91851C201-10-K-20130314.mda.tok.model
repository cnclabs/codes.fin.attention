item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction vaalco owns producing properties and conducts exploration activities as an operator in gabon  west africa  conducts exploration activities as an operator in angola  west africa  conducts exploration activities as a non operator in equatorial guinea  west africa  and has conducted exploration activities as a non operator in the british north sea 
vaalco is the operator of unconventional and conventional resource properties in the united states located in montana  south dakota  and north texas 
the company also owns minor interests in conventional production activities as a non operator in the united states 
a significant component of the company s results of operations is dependent upon the difference between prices received for its offshore gabon oil production and the costs to find and produce such oil 
oil and gas prices have been and are expected in the future to be volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors beyond the control of the company 
similarly  the costs to find and produce oil and gas are largely not within the control of the company  particularly in regard to the cost of leasing drilling rigs to drill and maintain offshore wells 
a key focus of the company is to maintain oil production from the etame marin block located offshore gabon at optimal levels within the constraints of the existing infrastructure 
the company operates the etame  avouma  south tchibala and ebouri fields on behalf of a consortium of five companies 
five subsea wells plus production from two platforms are tied back by pipelines to deliver oil and associated gas through a riser system to allow for delivery  processing  storage and ultimately offloading the oil from a leased floating  production  storage and offloading vessel fpso anchored to the seabed on the block 
with the fpso limitations of approximately  bopd and  barrels of total fluids per day  the challenge is to optimize production on both a near and long term basis subject to investment and operational agreements between the company and the consortium 
as part of the near term optimization  drilling and workover campaigns are developed and executed to drill new wells  partly to replace maturing wells  and to perform workovers to replace electrical submersible pumps in existing wells 
late in  a drilling and workover campaign began with the arrival of a drilling rig to conduct a six well program 
long term optimization progress was made in by the company and its partners approving the construction of two additional production platforms 
the two production platforms are part of the future development plans for the etame marin block 
one platform will be located in the etame field and the second platform will be located in between the southeast etame and north tchibala fields 
multiple wells are expected to be drilled from each of the platforms 
the company drilled a successful exploration well in the southeast etame area in which will be developed from the second platform 
the expected cost to build and install the platforms in the timeframe is million million net to the company 
the cost of the wells is not included in the platform costs 
in the presence of hydrogen sulfide hs from two of the three producing wells in the ebouri field was discovered 
the wells were shut in for safety reasons resulting in a decrease of approximately  bopd or approximately of the gross daily production from the etame marin block 
analysis and options for re establishing production from the impacted area was undertaken in the second half of the expected outcome is that additional capital investment will be required  which is likely to include a new platform type structure with hs processing capability  and new wells to re establish production from the impacted area 
the design  cost projections and final investment decisions by the company and its partners are expected to be made in re establishing production from the area impacted by hs is expected in the first half of besides the offshore etame marin block in gabon  the company operates the mutamba iroru block located onshore gabon 
the company has a working interest in the block 
after drilling two unsuccessful

index to financial statements exploration wells on the block in  the company entered into an agreement with total gabon to continue the exploration activities 
following seismic reprocessing  a discovery well was drilled in the plan of development will be the next step undertaken which will be the focus of for this property 
development of the onshore block is expected to capitalize on synergies such as office space  warehouse and open yard space and experienced personnel from our operating base in port gentil  gabon 
an important item for the company is growth in terms of establishing meaningful production operations in more than one country 
the company routinely evaluates working interest opportunities primarily in the west african geographic area where the company has significant expertise and where the base of the foreign operations is located 
during  the company identified an opportunity to purchase a working interest in block p  equatorial guinea 
in november  the company completed the acquisition of a working interest in the block at a cost of million 
prior to the company s acquisition  two recent oil discoveries had been made on the block  and there is exploration potential on other areas of the block 
the company expects to participate in the drilling of two exploration wells in the time horizon 
with a focus on diversification and utilizing available capital resources  the company invested in three non conventional acreage acquisitions in texas and montana in late and in two wells have been drilled on the texas acreage and brought on production 
the second well began production in march in montana  four unsuccessful exploration wells were drilled on the two properties in the outcome of the fifth well drilled in montana in will be determined in the first half of with the unsuccessful results in montana and increasing opportunities available to the company internationally  the company is not expecting to focus on further domestic property acquisitions in the near term 
critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used by the company in reporting its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting  such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  the company s reported results of operations would be different should it employ an alternative accounting method 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities the sec prescribes in regulation s x the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
like many other oil and gas companies  the company has chosen to follow the successful efforts method 
management believes that this method is preferable  as the company has focused on exploration activities wherein there is risk associated with future success and as such earnings are best represented by attachment to the drilling operations of the company 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the life of the related reserves 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses applicable to undeveloped leasehold  leasehold expiration costs and delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting  the company reviews proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its oil and gas properties may not be recoverable 
when it is determined that an oil and gas property s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount  an impairment charge must be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
this may occur if a field contains lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 

table of contents 
index to financial statements impairment of unproved property the company evaluates its unproved properties for impairment on a property by property basis 
the majority of the company s unproved property consists of acquisition costs related to its undeveloped acreage in angola  equatorial guinea and in the united states 
on at least a quarterly basis  management reviews the unproved property for indicators of impairment based on the company s current exploration plans with consideration given to results of any drilling and seismic activity during the period and known information regarding exploration activity by other companies on adjacent blocks 
see item properties and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s exploration plans in angola and equatorial guinea 
in angola  any adverse developments related to the company s ability to further extend the drilling obligation date  if necessary  could result in an impairment of the company s unproved properties and other assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
in the united states  the company recorded an impairment loss of million in to write down the value of its unproved property  due to its unsuccessful exploration activities million in roosevelt county  montana  million in sheridan county  montana  and million in harding county  south dakota 
asset retirement obligations aro the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the company s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells  removing and disposing of all or a portion of offshore oil and gas platforms  and capping pipelines 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
aro associated with retiring tangible long lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable 
the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset 
the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation  and similar activities associated with the company s oil and gas properties 
the company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value

in addition to the contractual obligations described above  the company entered into a sixth exploration period extension during and is required to spend million for its share of two exploration wells and acquire process square kilometers of d seismic on the etame marin block by july one of the two exploration commitment wells was drilled in on the omangou prospect at a cost of million million net to the company 
the seismic obligation was met with the acquisition of square kilometers of d seismic in the remaining obligation is the drilling of one exploration well which is scheduled for drilling in mid as part of securing the second ten year production license with the government of gabon  the company agreed in principle to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of the offshore wells  platforms and facilities 
the agreement is not yet finalized  but calls for annual funding for the next seven years at of the abandonment estimate and for the last three years of the production license 
the amounts paid will be reimbursed through the cost account and are non refundable to the company 
the funding is expected to begin in after the agreement is finalized 
the abandonment estimate for this purpose is estimated to be approximately million net to the company on an undiscounted basis 
as in prior periods  the obligation for abandonment of the gabon offshore facilities is included in the asset retirement obligation shown on the company s balance sheet

a plan of development is expected to be completed for the n gongui field and submitted to the government of gabon in in return for funding of the work commitment seismic reprocessing and exploration well costs  total gabon earned a interest on the permit 
in  the exploration permit was successfully extended until may and an application for a further nine month extension was made in early in a letter agreement from the government of gabon  the terms of the extension to march were agreed upon  yet the extension amendment was not executed by the government of gabon 
the company and total are working with the gabon government in to finalize the extension and to obtain a further exploration extension 
however  the company can provide no assurances that such a request will be granted 
the company believes the discovery area is not impacted by the uncertainty of the extension agreement as the well was drilled during the contracted period and application of the discovery was timely made to the government of gabon 
in november  the company signed a production sharing contract for block offshore angola 
the four year primary term with an optional three year extension awards the company exploration rights to million acres offshore central angola 
the company s working interest is 
additionally  the company is required to carry the angolan national oil company  sonangol p p  for of the work program 
during the first four years of the contract the company was required to acquire and process  square kilometers of d seismic data  drill two exploration wells and expend a minimum of million million net to the company 
the company fulfilled its seismic obligation when it acquired  square kilometers of d seismic data at a cost of million million net to the company in january and square kilometers of d seismic data during the fourth quarter of at a cost of million million net to the company 
the government assigned working interest partner was delinquent paying their share of the costs several times in and consequently was placed in a default position 
by a governmental decree dated december   the former partner was removed from the production sharing contract  and a one year time extension was granted for drilling the two exploration commitment wells 
following the decree  the company and the government of angola have been working together to obtain a replacement partner 
in early  the angolan government granted a further one year extension to november  for drilling the two exploration commitment wells in accordance with the production sharing contract 
in july  the angolan government granted an additional two year extension until november  to drill the two exploration commitment wells 
in the first quarter of  the company provided the angolan government with a written offer that would allow the company to proceed with exploration activities without obtaining a new partner  subject to certain criteria including changes to the work commitment and working interest percentages 
in the second quarter of  the company identified a potential partner to acquire the available working interest and submitted the name of the interested party to the angolan government for approval 
in november  the government advised the company that it has entered into negotiations with the potential partner 
the company met with the angolan government in january and learned the negotiations are still underway 
the remaining obligation is a two well exploration commitment 
each well is subject to a million penalty million in aggregate for both wells if not drilled during the contract term 
the million is currently recorded as restricted cash and is held at a financial institution located in the united states 
because of the continuing uncertainty with the angolan government approving a replacement partner  the company has recorded a full allowance totaling million as of december   against the accounts receivable from partners for the amounts owed to the company above its working interest plus the carried interest 
the allowance recorded in the twelve months ended december  totaled million with the remainder having been recorded in the company expects the gross receivable to be paid to the company if a new partner in the block is approved
