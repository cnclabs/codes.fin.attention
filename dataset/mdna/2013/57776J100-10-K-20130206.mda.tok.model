item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed in the section titled risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a provider of integrated  radio frequency and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for broadband communications applications 
our high performance radio frequency  or rf  receiver products capture and process digital and analog broadband signals to be decoded for various applications 
these products include both rf receivers and rf receiver systems on chip  or socs  which incorporate our highly integrated radio system architecture and the functionality necessary to demodulate broadband signals 
our current products enable the display of broadband video content in a wide range of electronic devices  including cable and terrestrial set top boxes  docsis data and voice gateways  digital televisions  mobile handsets  personal computers  netbooks and in vehicle entertainment devices 
our net revenue has grown from approximately million in to million in in and  our net revenue was derived from sales of global digital rf receiver products for digital television applications  automotive navigation displays  mobile handsets  cable modems and gateways 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend  among other factors  on our ability to further penetrate existing markets  our ability to expand our target addressable markets by developing new and innovative products  and our ability to obtain design wins with device manufacturers  in particular manufacturers of set top boxes and cable modems and gateways for the cable and satellite industries 
products shipped to asia accounted for  and of our net revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant but declining portion of these sales in asia are through distributors 
although a large percentage of our products are shipped to asia  we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers and incorporating our semiconductor products are then sold outside asia 
for example  we believe revenue generated from sales of our digital terrestrial set top box products during the years ended december  and related principally to sales to asian set top box manufacturers delivering products into europe  middle east  and africa  or emea  markets 
similarly  revenue generated from sales of our cable modem products during the years ended december  and related principally to sales to asian odm s and contract manufacturers delivering products into european and north american markets 
to date  all of our sales have been denominated in united states dollars 
a significant portion of our net revenue has historically been generated by a limited number of customers 
during the year ended december   arris and pace accounted for and  respectively  of our net revenue  and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
during the year ended december   panasonic and arris accounted for and  respectively  of our net revenue  and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
for certain customers  we sell multiple products into disparate end user applications such as cable modems and cable set top boxes 
our business depends on winning competitive bid selection processes  known as design wins  to develop semiconductors for use in our customers products 
these selection processes are typically lengthy  and as a result  our sales cycles will vary based on the specific market served  whether the design win is with an existing or a new customer and whether our product being designed in our customer s device is a first generation or subsequent generation product 
our customers products can be complex and  if our engagement results in a 
table of contents design win  can require significant time to define  design and result in volume production 
because the sales cycle for our products is long  we can incur significant design and development expenditures in circumstances where we do not ultimately recognize any revenue 
we do not have any long term purchase commitments with any of our customers  all of whom purchase our products on a purchase order basis 
once one of our products is incorporated into a customer s design  however  we believe that our product is likely to remain a component of the customer s product for its life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative chip 
product life cycles in our target markets will vary by application 
for example  in the digital set top box market a design in can have a product life cycle of to months 
in the automotive sector  the product life cycle of a design in can range from to months 
in the mobile television sector  the product life cycle can range from to months 
in march  we completed the initial public offering  or ipo  of our class a common stock in which we sold and issued million shares of class a common stock  including million shares related to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds in the ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
immediately prior to the closing of the ipo  all shares of our then outstanding convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into million shares of our class b common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  production masks  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
we believe that the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue is generated from sales of our integrated circuits 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title to product transfers to customers either when it is shipped to or received by the customer  based on the terms of the specific agreement with the customer 
revenue is recorded based on the facts at the time of sale 
transactions for which we cannot reliably estimate the amount that will ultimately be collected at the time the product has shipped and title has transferred to the customer are deferred until the amount that is probable of collection can be determined 
items that are considered when determining the amounts that will be ultimately collected are a customer s overall creditworthiness and payment history  customer rights to return unsold product  customer rights to price protection  customer payment terms conditioned on sale or use of product by the customer  or extended payment terms granted to a customer 

table of contents a portion of our revenues are generated from sales made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or stock rotation rights of return 
revenues from our distributors accounted for of net revenue for the year ended december  revenues from our distributors accounted for of net revenue in the year ended december  pricing credits to our distributors may result from our pricing credit and unit rebate provisions  among other factors 
these pricing credits and or stock rotation rights prevent us from being able to reliably estimate the final sales price of the inventory sold and the amount of inventory that could be returned pursuant to these agreements 
as a result  for sales to distributors  we have determined that it does not meet all of the required revenue recognition criteria at the time we deliver our products to distributors as the final sales price is not fixed or determinable 
for these distributor transactions  revenue is not recognized until product is shipped to the end customer and the amount that will ultimately be collected is fixed or determinable 
upon shipment of product to these distributors  title to the inventory transfers to the distributor and the distributor is invoiced  generally with day terms 
on shipments to our distributors where revenue is not recognized  we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieving the inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record the corresponding deferred profit in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of deferred revenue  representing the difference between the receivable recorded and the cost of inventory shipped 
future pricing credits and or stock rotation rights from our distributors may result in the realization of a different amount of profit included in our future consolidated statements of operations than the amount recorded as deferred profit in our consolidated balance sheets 
we record reductions in revenue for estimated pricing adjustments related to price protection and unit rebate agreements with our end customers in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
price protection pricing adjustments are recorded at the time of sale as a reduction to revenue and an increase in our accrued liabilities 
we may enter into unit rebate agreements with end customers based on volume purchases 
we estimate that all of the unit rebates will be achieved based on the history of these programs  reduce the average selling price of the product sold under the rebate program and defer revenue for the difference between the amount billed to the customer and the adjusted average selling price 
once the targeted level is achieved  the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as rebated products are shipped to the end customer 
deferred revenue associated with rebate programs is included in deferred revenue and deferred profit in the consolidated balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based on each customers credit worthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been insignificant  we may experience higher credit loss rates in the future than we have in the past 
our receivables are concentrated in relatively few customers 
therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one significant customer could make collection of our accounts receivable more difficult  require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and negatively affect our working capital 
inventory valuation we continually assess the recoverability of our inventory based on assumptions about demand and market conditions 
forecasted demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market reflects current replacement cost eg net replacement value which cannot exceed net realizable value or fall below net realizable value less an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
we reduce our inventory to its lower of cost or market on a part by part basis to account for its obsolescence or lack of marketability 
reductions are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and its market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our 
table of contents operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross profits when products are sold 
production masks production masks with alternative future uses or discernible future benefits are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life of two years 
to determine if the production mask has alternative future uses or benefits  we evaluate risks associated with developing new technologies and capabilities  and the related risks associated with entering new markets 
production masks that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as research and development costs 
intangible assets technologies acquired or licensed from other companies are capitalized and amortized over the greater of the terms of the agreement  or estimated useful life  not to exceed three years 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying amount of our long lived assets  as well as the useful lives  to determine whether indicators of impairment may exist which warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
should impairment exist  the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value 
income taxes we provide for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes generally represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes result from the differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when a judgment is made that is considered more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
a decision to record a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense or a decrease in income tax benefit 
if the valuation allowance is released in a future period  income tax expense will be reduced accordingly 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
stock based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity incentive awards  including stock options  employee stock purchase rights  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards based on the grant date 
table of contents fair value of the award 
we use the black scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase rights granted to employees 
we calculate the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards based on the fair market value of our class a common stock on the grant date 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight line method and classify these amounts in the statements of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports 
we calculate the weighted average expected life of options using the simplified method as prescribed by guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission 
this decision is based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited historical experience 
we will continue to assess the appropriateness of the use of the simplified method as we develop a history of option exercises 
we account for stock options issued to non employees in accordance with authoritative guidance for equity based payments to non employees 
stock options issued to non employees are accounted for at their estimated fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of options granted to non employees is re measured as they vest  and the resulting increase in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
we calculate the fair value of restricted stock units issued to non employees based on the fair market value of our class a common stock on the grant date and the resulting stock based compensation expense is recognized over the period during which the non employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
results of operations the following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations 
net revenue 
net revenue is generated from sales of our rf receivers and rf receiver socs 
a significant but declining portion of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors 
although we actually sell the products to  and are paid by  the distributors  we refer to these end customers as our customers 
cost of net revenue 
cost of net revenue includes the cost of finished silicon wafers processed by third party foundries  costs associated with our outsourced packaging and assembly  test and shipping  costs of personnel  including stock based compensation  and equipment associated with manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance  amortization of certain production mask costs  cost of production load boards and sockets  and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
research and development 
research and development expense includes personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation  new product engineering mask costs  prototype integrated circuit packaging and test costs  computer aided design software license costs  intellectual property license costs  reference design development costs  development testing and evaluation costs  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
research and development activities include the design of new products  refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense includes personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation  distributor and other third party sales commissions  field application engineering support  travel costs  professional and consulting fees  legal fees  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
interest income 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense consists primarily of imputed interest on i the purchase of licensed technology and ii property and equipment capital leases 
other income expense 
other income expense generally consists of income expense generated from minor non operating transactions 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes and the realizability of assets in future years 
income tax expense for the year ended december  primarily relates to income tax in foreign jurisdictions 
income tax expense for the year ended december  is primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the net federal deferred tax asset in the third quarter of the income tax benefit for the year ended december  includes the reversal of our valuation allowance previously offsetting our federal deferred tax assets

we expect sales of our hybrid tv tuner and cable products to account for a substantial portion of our revenue growth  if any  in the demand for our terrestrial and cable tv products will depend on several 
table of contents factors  including the rate of worldwide transition from analog to digital terrestrial and cable tv broadcast  and the growth in demand  if any  for high speed broadband connectivity and multimedia content and services 
net revenue for the year ended december  increased by million from primarily due to an increase in sales revenue from cable products of million  offset by a decrease in revenue derived from consumer terrestrial tv set top box and mobile handset applications of million 
cost of net revenue and gross profit years ended december  change dollars in thousands cost of net revenue of net revenue gross profit of net revenue cost of net revenue increased by million from to gross profit increased by million from to  accompanied by a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to 
the increase in gross profit was driven primarily by the million increase in our cable product revenue  which more than offset revenue declines of million in terrestrial applications  the vast majority of the declines were related to our higher margin automotive  mobile handset  and digital only tv tuners 
the decrease in the gross profit percentage was largely due to the above noted changes in product mix related to significant declines in our higher margin legacy mobile and automotive handset applications 
we currently expect that gross profit percentage will fluctuate in the future  from quarter to quarter  based on changes in product mix  average selling prices  and average manufacturing costs 
cost of net revenue increased by million from to gross profit decreased by million from to  with an accompanying decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to 
the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to declines in japan digital television applications that were only partially offset by cost reductions  and the impact of mix changes related to growth in lower margin cable products that were ramping aggressively in specifically  mix significantly influenced gross profit and gross profit percentage  as revenues derived from higher margin products addressing japanese digital only tv  pctv  and mobile handset applications declined approximately million  and were offset by a roughly equal amount of growth in significantly lower margin cable applications 
research and development years ended december  change dollars in thousands research and development of net revenue research and development expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in a combination of payroll related items of million and prototyping and mask expenses of million  partially offset by a reduction in spending on embedded intellectual property ip licensing of million 
payroll related expenses including stock based compensation increased due to increases in our average full time equivalent headcount compared to prior year  expenses related to the employee bonus plan and an increase in employee healthcare costs 
also contributing to the increase were additional expenses related to our first nanometer mask set and computer aided design and 
table of contents related software licensing costs 
in the past  we have entered into technology license agreements based on management review and determinations concerning market opportunities 
we cannot predict whether we will enter into more of these types of licenses or the magnitude or timing of any such license agreements 
absent these types of licensing events  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to focus on expanding our product portfolio and enhancing existing products 
research and development expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of new rf receiver soc product development and existing product enhancement initiatives 
the increase in research and development expense also includes a new initiative to develop moca  or multimedia over coax alliance  solutions for inside the home data  and video network connectivity 
investments in intellectual property and software related to connectivity technologies  including the acquisition of certain moca intellectual property and connectivity related software licenses  increased by million compared to the prior year 
salary and benefits expense including stock based compensation increased million compared to the prior year 
the increase in salary and benefits is primarily due to an increase in our average full time equivalent employee headcount compared to the prior year 
also contributing to the increases  compared to the prior year  were additional expenses for computer aided design and related software license costs  new product engineering mask costs  supplies  travel and other costs 
selling  general and administrative years ended december  change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative of net revenue selling  general and administrative expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from this cost was primarily attributable to increase costs associated with the need for larger scale operations to support increase in demand for our products 
specifically  the increase was primarily attributable in part to additional million of incremental payroll related expense including stock based compensation due to an increase in our average full time equivalent headcount  expenses related to the employee bonus plan and increases in employee healthcare costs 
also contributing to these increases were incremental professional and legal expenses of million including significant incremental legal expenses related to a previously disclosed export compliance matter as well as our initiation and defense of litigation with silicon laboratories  or silicon labs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we expand our sales and marketing organization to enable expansion into existing and new markets  as we continue to build our international administrative infrastructure 
future selling  general  and administrative expenses could also be affected by legal expenses associated with the lawsuit filed against silicon labs and related actions 
we have not recorded any accrual for loss contingencies associated with silicon labs litigation  determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible  or determined that the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from this increase was primarily attributable to increase in costs associated with the need for larger scale operations to support the increase in demand for our products  and increased expenses associated with regulatory compliance initiatives  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
specifically  the increase was attributable in part to an additional million of incremental salary and benefit expenses in including stock based compensation 
also contributing to the increases were incremental legal  accounting and other professional expenses  consulting expenses  travel related costs  and occupancy expenses

the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was primarily related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against our net federal deferred tax asset in the third quarter of we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to offset the federal and california deferred tax assets as realization of such assets does not meet the more likely than not threshold required under accounting guidelines 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating positive and negative evidence that may exist 
until such time that we remove the valuation allowance against our federal and california deferred tax assets  our provision for income taxes will primarily consist of taxes associated with our foreign subsidiaries 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million or approximately of pre tax loss compared to a benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate in the year ended december  is primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the net federal deferred tax asset in the third quarter of the income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  includes the reversal of our valuation allowance previously offsetting our federal deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources in march  we received net proceeds from our ipo of approximately million after underwriters discounts of million and additional offering related costs of approximately million 
prior to the ipo  
table of contents our primary sources of cash were  historically  proceeds from issuances of convertible preferred stock and cash collections from customers 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  long term investments of million and net accounts receivable of million 
our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses  purchases of inventory and the acquisition of property and equipment 
cash used to fund operating expenses excludes the impact of non cash items such as depreciation and stock based compensation and is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our primary sources of cash are cash receipts on accounts receivable from our shipment of products to distributors and direct customers 
aside from the growth in amounts billed to our customers  net cash collections of accounts receivable are impacted by the efficiency of our cash collections process  which can vary from period to period depending on the payment cycles of our major distributor customers 
following is a summary of our working capital and cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated years ended december  in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents stock repurchase in the year ended december   our board of directors and the audit committee of our board of directors approved the repurchase and retirement of million shares of our class a common stock and the repurchase and retirement of million shares of our class b common stock

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total and thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations other obligations inventory purchase obligations total contractual obligations other obligations represent purchase commitments for software licensing agreements  information systems infrastructure and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when or if cash settlement with taxing authorities will occur for our unrecognized tax benefits 
therefore  our unrecognized tax benefits of million are not included in the table above 
warranties and indemnifications in connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business  we often make representations affirming  among other things  that our products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  and agree to indemnify customers against third party claims for such infringement 
further  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our officers and directors against any action that may arise out of their services in that capacity  and we have also entered into indemnification agreements with respect to all of our directors and certain controlling persons 
as of december   we incurred expenses of million under such provisions related to a previously disclosed export compliance matter 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
recent accounting pronouncements for additional information regarding recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained within this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk to date  our international customer and vendor agreements have been denominated almost exclusively in united states dollars 
accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
the functional currency of certain foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
accordingly  the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of these foreign subsidiaries operations are accounted for as translation gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
we do not believe that a change of in such foreign currency exchange rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   which was held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these investments as a result of changes in interest rates due to their short term nature 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
investments risk our investments  consisting of us treasury and agency obligations and corporate notes and bonds  are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
in the event that there are differences between fair value and cost in any of our available for sale securities  unrealized gains and losses on these investments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates
