the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition for the three fiscal years ended march  the discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 

table of contents except for the historical information contained herein  the discussions in this document contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under the item a  risk factors and  from time to time  in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
business overview we are a leading global manufacturer of a wide variety of tantalum  multilayer ceramic  solid and electrolytic aluminum and film capacitors 
capacitors are electronic components that store  filter  and regulate electrical energy and current flow 
as an essential passive component used in most circuit boards  capacitors are typically used for coupling  decoupling  filtering  oscillating and wave shaping and are used in communication systems  data processing equipment  personal computers  cellular phones  automotive electronic systems  defense and aerospace systems  consumer electronics  power management systems and many other electronic devices and systems basically anything that plugs in or has a battery 
we manufacture a broad line of capacitors in many different sizes and configurations using a variety of raw materials 
our product line consists of over  distinct part configurations distinguished by various attributes  such as dielectric or insulating material  configuration  encapsulation  capacitance at various tolerances  voltage  performance characteristics and packaging 
most of our customers have multiple capacitance requirements  often within each of their products 
our broad product offering allows us to meet the majority of those needs independent of application and end use 
in fiscal year and we shipped billion capacitors each year 
we believe the long term demand for various types of capacitors we offer will grow on a regional and global basis due to a variety of factors  including increasing demand for and complexity of electronic products  growing demand for technology in emerging markets and the ongoing development of new solutions for energy generation and conservation

many of our professionals have developed unparalleled experience in building leadership positions in new markets  as well as successfully integrating acquisitions 
our member executive management team has an average of over years of experience with us and an average of over years of experience in the manufacturing industry 
business strategy our strategy is to use our position as a leading  high quality manufacturer of capacitors to capitalize on the increasingly demanding requirements of our customers 
key elements of our strategy include one kemet campaign 
we continue to focus on improving our business capabilities through various initiatives that all fall under our one kemet campaign 
the one kemet campaign aims to ensure that we as a company are focused on the same goals and working with the same processes and systems to ensure consistent quality and service 
this effort was launched to ensure that as we continue to grow we not only remain grounded in our core principles but that we use those principles  operating procedures and systems as the foundation from which to expand 
these initiatives include our global oracle software implementation which we expect to complete in the first half of fiscal year  our 
table of contents lean and six sigma culture evolution and our global customer accounts management program  which is now implemented and will be expanding 
develop our significant customer relationships and industry presence 
we intend to continue to be responsive to our customers needs and requirements and to make order entry and fulfillment easier  faster  more flexible and more reliable for our customers  by focusing on building products around customers needs  by giving decision making authority to customer facing personnel and by providing purpose built systems and processes 
continue to pursue low cost production strategy 
we continue to evaluate and are actively pursuing measures that will allow us to maintain our position as a low cost producer of capacitors with facilities close to our customers 
we have shifted and will continue to shift production to low cost locations in order to reduce material and labor costs 
we have expanded our manufacturing to macedonia which has low production costs 
additionally  we are focused on developing more cost efficient manufacturing equipment and processes  designing manufacturing plants for more efficient production and reducing work in process wip inventory by building products from start to finish in one factory 
furthermore  we continue to implement the lean and six sigma methodology to drive towards zero product defects so that quality remains a given in the minds of our customers

we continue to leverage our technological competence to introduce new products in a timely and cost efficient manner and generate an increasing portion of our sales from new and customized solutions to meet our customers varied and evolving capacitor needs as well as to improve financial performance 
we believe that by continuing to build on our strength in the higher growth and higher margin specialty segments of the capacitor market  we will be well positioned to achieve our long term growth objectives while also improving our profitability 
during fiscal year  we introduced  new products of which  were first to market  and specialty products accounted for of our revenue over this period 
further expand our broad capacitance capabilities 
we identify ourselves as the electronic components company and strive to be the supplier of choice for all our customers capacitance needs across the full spectrum of dielectric materials including tantalum  ceramic  solid and electrolytic aluminum  film and paper 
while we believe we have the most complete line of capacitor technologies across these primary capacitor types  we intend to continue to research and pursue additional capacitance technologies and solutions in order to maximize the breadth of our product offerings 
selectively target complementary acquisitions and equity investments 
as strategic opportunities are identified  we will evaluate and possibly pursue them if they would enable us to enhance our competitive position and expand our market presence 
our strategy is to acquire complementary capacitor and other related businesses that would allow us to leverage our business model  potentially including those involved in other passive components that are synergistic with our customers technologies and our current product offerings 
for example  in fiscal year  we acquired cornell dubilier foil  llc whose name was subsequently changed to kemet foil manufacturing  llc kemet foil and niotan incorporated whose name was subsequently changed to kemet blue powder corporation which has allowed us to vertically integrate certain manufacturing processes within film and electrolytic and tantalum  respectively 
in addition  on february  kec  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired a economic interest in nec tokin  a manufacturer of tantalum capacitors and electro magnetic  electro mechanical and access devices

global sales marketing strategy 
our motto think global act local describes our approach to sales and marketing 
each of our three sales regions americas  emea and apac has account managers  field application engineers and strategic marketing managers in the region 
in addition  we also have local customer and quality control support in each region 
this organizational structure allows us to respond to the needs of our customers on a timely basis and in their native language 
the regions are managed locally and report to a senior manager who is on the kemet leadership team 
furthermore  this organizational structure ensures the efficient communication of our global goals and strategies and allows us to serve the language  cultural and other region specific needs of our customers 
kemet is organized into three business groups tantalum  ceramic  and film and electrolytic 
each business group is responsible for the operations of certain manufacturing sites as well as all related research and development efforts 
the sales  marketing and corporate functions are shared by each of the business groups 
see note  segment and geographic information to our consolidated financial statements 
recent developments and trends sales in fiscal year have decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year average selling prices for capacitors decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of excess capacity in the market  a general softening of the markets and a shift in sales from europe  emea to apac 
to offset the decrease in sales  we have continued to shift production to lower cost locations and to restructure our operations 
through our recent acquisition and equity investment activity we believe we can enhance our competitive position 
these trends are described in more detail below 
equity investment on march   kemet electronics corporation kec  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  entered into a stock purchase agreement the stock purchase agreement to acquire of the common stock which represents a economic interest of nec tokin corporation nec tokin  a manufacturer of tantalum capacitors  electro magnetic  electro mechanical and access devices  the initial purchase from nec corporation nec of japan 
the transaction closed on february   at which time kec paid a purchase price of million for new shares of common stock of nec tokin the initial closing 
the company accounts for the equity investment using the equity method in a non consolidated variable interest entity since kec does not have the power to direct significant activities of nec tokin 
in connection with kec entry into the stock purchase agreement  kec entered into a stockholders agreement the stockholders agreement with nec tokin and nec  which provides for restrictions on transfers of nec tokin capital stock  certain tag along and first refusal rights on transfer  restrictions on nec ability to convert the preferred stock of nec tokin held by it  certain management services to be provided to nec tokin by kec or an affiliate of kec and certain board representation rights 
kec holds four of seven nec tokin director positions 
however  nec has significant board rights 
the stockholders agreement also contemplates a loan from nec to nec tokin in connection with nec tokin rebuilding of its operations in thailand as a result of flooding that occurred in concurrent with entry into the stock purchase agreement and the stockholders agreement  kec entered into an option agreement the option agreement with nec whereby kec may purchase 
table of contents additional shares of nec tokin common stock from nec tokin for a purchase price of million resulting in an economic interest of approximately while maintaining ownership of of nec tokin common stock the first call option by providing notice of the first call option between the initial closing and august  upon providing such notice  kec may also exercise an option to purchase all outstanding capital stock of nec tokin from its stockholders  primarily nec  for a purchase price based on the greater of six times ltm ebitda as defined in the option agreement less the previous payments and certain other adjustments  or the outstanding amount of nec tokin debt obligation to nec the second call option by providing notice of the second call option by may  from august  through may   nec may require kec to purchase all outstanding capital stock of nec tokin from its stockholders  primarily nec 
however  nec may only exercise this right the put option from august  through april  if nec tokin achieves certain financial performance 
the purchase price for the put option will be based on the greater six times ltm ebitda less previous payments and certain other adjustments  or the outstanding amount of nec tokin debt obligation to nec as of the date the put option is exercised 
the purchase price for the put option is reduced by the amount of nec tokin debt obligation to nec which kec will assume 
the determination of the purchase price will be modified in the event there is an unresolved agreement between nec and us under the stockholders agreement 
in the event the put option is exercised  nec will be required to maintain in place the outstanding debt obligation owed by nec tokin to nec 
impairment charge consistent with prior years  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of may st 
due to reduced earnings and cash flows caused by macro economic factors and excess capacity issues in our industry  we revised our earnings forecast  as a result  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal year  which represents all of the goodwill related to the kemet foil manufacturing  llc kemet foil reporting unit 
write down of long lived assets during fiscal year and corresponding with a restructuring of our tantalum operations in the evora  portugal manufacturing facility  we incurred impairment charges totaling million 
this restructuring is expected to be completed during the quarter ending march  as a part of our ongoing commitment to expand our polymer capacity we will be moving tantalum manufacturing operations from the evora  portugal facility to a manufacturing facility in mexico and the equipment in portugal will be disposed 
we used an income approach to estimate the fair value of the assets to be disposed 
also in fiscal year and in connection with the consolidation of two film and electrolytic manufacturing facilities within italy  we incurred impairment charges totaling million 
appraisals for these manufacturing facilities indicated there was a decrease in market value and  therefore  the carrying amounts of these manufacturing facilities were reviewed for recoverability 
it was determined that the carrying amounts of the manufacturing facilities were not recoverable since they exceeded the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset asset group 
the impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset asset group exceeded its fair value 
restructuring in fiscal year  we initiated the first phase of a plan to restructure film and electrolytic and to reduce overhead within the company as a whole 
since that time the restructuring plan has been expanded to all business groups and includes implementing programs to make the company more competitive by removing excess capacity  moving production to lower cost locations and eliminating 
table of contents unnecessary costs throughout the company 
restructuring charges in the fiscal year ended march  include personnel reduction costs of million and manufacturing relocation costs of million 
these personnel reduction costs are comprised of the following million in termination benefits associated with converting the landsberg  germany manufacturing facility into a technology center  million in termination benefits associated with converting the weymouth  united kingdom manufacturing facility into a technology center  million for reductions in production workforce in mexico  million for reductions in production workforce in portugal  million for headcount reductions at an innovation center  million for reductions in administrative overhead primarily in the corporate headquarters and million for reductions in production workforce and administrative overhead across the entire company 
construction has commenced on a new manufacturing facility in pontecchio  italy  that will allow for the closure and consolidation of multiple manufacturing operations located in italy 
in addition to these personnel reduction costs  we incurred manufacturing relocation costs of million for the relocation of equipment to bulgaria  china  macedonia and mexico and for the consolidation of manufacturing operations within italy and million in lease termination costs related to the relocation of a sales office 
during the remainder of this restructuring plan  we expect to incur charges of million for relocation  severance and other restructuring related costs in film and electrolytic 
in addition  on may   the company expanded the global restructuring plan to include additional headcount reductions which will affect approximately employees 
the company has recorded a charge to earnings related to severance expenses of million in fiscal year as a result of this action  which was reflected in the paragraph above 
the company expects to incur an additional charge of million in the upcoming quarter ending june  the expected total cash expenditures are estimated to be million for the termination benefits related termination benefits for these employees 
in addition  we expect to incur million of costs primarily related to capital spending related to the construction of a new manufacturing facility in pontecchio  italy 
as the two existing facilities in italy are vacated  we will offer these properties for sale 
we expect the restructuring plan to result in a million reduction in our operating cost structure in europe in fiscal year compared to fiscal year we anticipate that benefits from the restructuring plan will continue to grow during fiscal years and during fiscal year  we expect to realize the full potential of the restructuring plan  achieving total annualized operational cost reductions of million to million versus fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements as of march   other than operating lease commitments as described in note  commitments and contingencies  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are summarized in note  organization and significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
the following identifies a number of policies which require significant judgments and estimates  or are otherwise deemed critical to our financial statements 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical data and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in addition  they affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

table of contents our judgments are based on our assessment as to the effect certain estimates  assumptions  or future trends or events may have on the financial condition and results of operations reported in the consolidated financial statements 
readers should understand that actual future results could differ from these estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available  can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors 
the amounts used to assess sensitivity ie    etc 
are included to allow readers of this annual report on form k to understand a general cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent our predictions of variability 
for all of these estimates  it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and estimates require regular review and adjustment 
we believe the following critical accounting policies contain the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we ship products to customers based upon firm orders and revenue is recognized when the sales process is complete 
this occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of an agreement of sale  there is a fixed or determinable selling price  title and risk of loss have been transferred and collectability is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
a portion of sales is related to products designed to meet customer specific requirements 
these products typically have stricter tolerances making them useful to the specific customer requesting the product and to customers with similar or less stringent requirements 
we recognize revenue when title to the products transfers to the customer 
a portion of sales is made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by distributors 
our distributor policy includes inventory price protection and ship from stock and debit sfsd programs common in the industry 
the price protection policy protects the value of the distributors inventory in the event we reduce our published selling price to distributors 
this program allows the distributor to debit us for the difference between our list price and the lower authorized price for specific parts 
we establish price protection reserves on specific parts residing in distributors inventories in the period that the price protection is formally authorized by kemet 
the sfsd program provides a mechanism for the distributor to meet a competitive price after obtaining authorization from the local company sales office 
this program allows the distributor to ship its higher priced inventory and debit us for the difference between our list price and the lower authorized price for that specific transaction 
we establish reserves for our sfsd program based primarily on historical sfsd activity and certain distributors actual inventory levels comprising approximately of the total global distributor inventory related to customers which participate in the sfsd program 
estimates are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
if these estimates were changed by in fiscal year  net sales would be impacted by million 
the establishment of these reserves is recognized as a component of the line item net sales on the consolidated statements of operations  while the associated reserves are included in the line item accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
estimates used in determining sales allowances are subject to various factors 
this includes  but is not limited to  changes in economic conditions  pricing changes  product demand  inventory levels in the supply chain  the effects of technological change  and other variables that might result in changes to our estimates 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for most of the inventory  cost is determined under the first in  first out method 
for tool crib  a component of our raw material inventory  cost is determined under the average cost method 
the valuation of inventories requires us to make estimates 
we also must assess the prices at which we believe the finished 
table of contents goods inventory can be sold compared to its cost 
a sharp decrease in demand could adversely impact earnings as the reserve estimates could increase 
pension and post retirement benefits 
our management  with the assistance of actuarial firms  performs actuarial valuations of the fair values of our pension and post retirement plans benefit obligations 
we make certain assumptions that have a significant effect on the calculated fair value of the obligations such as the weighted average discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation  salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on post retirement obligations  and medical cost inflation used to calculate the impact future medical costs will have on post retirement obligations 
we understand that these assumptions directly impact the actuarial valuation of the obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the income or expense that flows through the consolidated statements of operations 
we base our assumptions on either historical or market data that we consider reasonable 
variations in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reported in consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations 
the most critical assumption relates to the discount rate 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in changes to the projected benefit obligation of million and million  respectively 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
we perform our impairment test during the first quarter of each fiscal year and when otherwise warranted 
we evaluate our goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
this requires us to estimate the fair value of the reporting units based on the future net cash flows expected to be generated 
the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit  with the corresponding carrying amounts 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill being measured exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the amounts assigned to identified net assets 
as a result  the implied fair value of goodwill is generally the residual amount that results from subtracting the value of net assets including all tangible assets and identified intangible assets from the fair value of the reporting unit fair value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income based  discounted cash flow dcf analysis  and market based approaches guideline publicly traded company method and guideline transaction method which examine transactions in the marketplace involving the sale of the stocks of similar publicly owned companies  or the sale of entire companies engaged in operations similar to kemet 
in addition to the above described reporting unit valuation techniques  our goodwill impairment assessment also considers our aggregate fair value based upon the value of our outstanding shares of common stock 
long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset classified as held for sale is initially measured and reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

table of contents long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the long lived asset is disposed of 
tests for the recoverability of a long lived asset to be held and used are performed by comparing the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows  we use future projections of cash flows directly associated with  and which are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
these assumptions include  among other estimates  periods of operation and projections of sales and cost of sales 
changes in any of these estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if it is determined that the book value of a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value 
the fair value is calculated as the discounted cash flows of the underlying assets 
historically  we performed impairment tests on our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life during the first quarter of each fiscal year and when otherwise warranted 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  due to reduced earnings and cash flows caused by macro economic factors and excess capacity issues in our industry  the company recorded a million goodwill impairment charge  which represented all of the goodwill related to the kemet foil reporting unit 
as described in note  goodwill and intangible assets  the quarter ended december  the company voluntarily changed the test date of its annual goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test from may st to january st 
the company completed its impairment test on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as of january  and concluded that no impairment existed 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate used in the valuation would have resulted in changes in the fair value of million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions will not be realized  based on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the recent history of cumulative losses  and the insufficient evidence of projected future taxable income to overcome the loss history 
we have provided a valuation allowance related to any benefits from income taxes resulting from the application of a statutory tax rate to the deferred tax assets 
we continue to have net deferred tax assets future tax benefits in several jurisdictions which we expect to realize assuming  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient taxable income can be generated to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional tax expense 
the accounting rules require that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
any accruals for estimated interest and penalties would be recorded as a component of income tax expense 

table of contents to the extent that the provision for income taxes changed by of income before income taxes  consolidated net income would change by million in fiscal year results of operations historically  revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results due to various economic and other factors

film and electrolytic  ceramic and tantalum sales decreased by million  million and million  respectively 
average selling prices for capacitors decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to excess capacity in the market  a general softening of the markets and a shift in sales from emea to apac 
in addition  within film and electrolytic the machinery division decreased net sales by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year 
table of contents in fiscal years and  net sales by region were as follows dollars in millions fiscal year fiscal year net sales of total net sales of total americas americas apac apac emea emea in fiscal years and  the percentages of net sales by channel to total net sales were as follows fiscal year fiscal year net sales of total net sales of total distributors distributors ems ems oem oem gross margin gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to of net sales from of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
the primary contributor to the gross margin decline was a million gross margin decrease in film and electrolytic for the fiscal year compared to fiscal year corresponding with a decrease in unit sales volume of which created unfavorable fixed cost absorption and lower plant capacity utilization which led to lower efficiencies 
in addition  excess capacity in the market led to a decrease in average selling prices in tantalum and ceramics which decreased gross margin 
in addition  we incurred million of plant start up costs in the year ended march  compared to million in the year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal year compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal year the million decrease in sg a expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year includes the following decreases million in selling and incentive expenses consistent with the decrease in sales  million in human resources and information technology expenses due to cost savings initiatives  and a million decrease in marketing activities and projects 
partially offsetting these decreases were a million increase in incentive compensation related to stock based compensation  and an increase of million related to our investment in nec tokin 
in addition  in fiscal year  we incurred a million expense related to our investment to improve the health and educational facilities in the community of the katanga province of the democratic republic of the congo 
restructuring charges restructuring charges in the fiscal year ended march  include personnel reduction costs of million and manufacturing relocation costs of million 
the personnel reduction costs are comprised of the following million in termination benefits associated with converting the landsberg  germany manufacturing facility into a technology center  million in termination benefits associated with converting the weymouth  united kingdom manufacturing facility into a technology center  million for reductions in production workforce in mexico  million for 
table of contents reductions in production workforce in portugal  million for headcount reductions at an innovation center  million for reductions in administrative overhead primarily in the corporate headquarters and million for reductions in production workforce and administrative overhead across the entire company 
in addition to these personnel reduction costs  we incurred manufacturing relocation costs of million for relocation of equipment to bulgaria  china  macedonia and mexico and for the consolidation of manufacturing operations within italy and million in lease termination costs related to the relocation of a sales office 
the restructuring charges in fiscal year included termination benefits of million related to facility closures in italy that commenced during fiscal year and charges of million that were incurred by the company to participate in a plan to save labor costs whereby a company may temporarily lay off employees while the government continues to pay their wages for a certain period of time 
these charges are a continuation of our european restructuring plan  primarily within film and electrolytic 
construction has commenced on a new manufacturing facility in pontecchio  italy  that will allow for the closure and consolidation of multiple manufacturing operations located in italy 
in addition  we incurred million in personnel reduction costs primarily due to headcount reductions within tantalum operations in mexico 
in addition to these personnel reduction costs  we incurred manufacturing relocation costs of million for relocation of equipment to china and mexico 
research and development research and development expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal year  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal year the million decrease resulted from headcount reductions taken in fiscal year to align the r d expenses within an acceptable percentage of net sales 
write down of long lived assets during fiscal year and corresponding with a restructuring of our tantalum operations in the evora  portugal manufacturing facility  we incurred impairment charges totaling million 
this restructuring is expected to be completed during the quarter ending march  as a part of our ongoing commitment to expand our polymer capacity we will be moving tantalum manufacturing operations from the evora  portugal facility to a manufacturing facility in mexico and the equipment in portugal will be disposed 
we used an income approach to estimate the fair value of the assets to be disposed 
also in fiscal year and in connection with the consolidation of two film and electrolytic manufacturing facilities within italy  we incurred impairment charges totaling million 
appraisals for these manufacturing facilities indicated there was a decrease in market value and  therefore  the carrying amounts of these manufacturing facilities were reviewed for recoverability

the impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset asset group exceeded its fair value 
in addition  in fiscal year we incurred a million charge related to the write off of a trademark which is no longer utilized 
during fiscal year  we incurred impairment charges of million related to tantalum equipment which was disposed of since the equipment could not meet customer demands for lower esr capacitors

we believe that adjusted operating income  adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda are complements to us gaap amounts and such measures are useful to investors 
the presentation of these non gaap measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity

we use adjusted operating income to facilitate our analysis and understanding of our business operations and believe that adjusted operating income is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the company 
adjusted operating income should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted net income represents net income loss  excluding adjustments which are more specifically outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided above 
we use adjusted net income to evaluate the company operating performance and believe that adjusted net income is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the company 
adjusted net income should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted ebitda represents net income loss before income tax expense  interest expense  net  and depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude the following items restructuring charges  write down of long lived assets  erp integration costs  plant start up costs  stock based compensation expense  acquisition related fees  goodwill impairment  net curtailment and settlement gain on benefit plans  gain loss on sales and disposals of assets  net foreign exchange gain loss  registration related fees  gain loss on the early extinguishment of debt  inventory write downs and gain on licensing of patents 
we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance and ability to service debt 
we also present adjusted ebitda because we believe such measure is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 

table of contents we believe adjusted ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are  by definition  available to pay interest and tax expense is inversely correlated to interest expense because tax expense goes down as deductible interest expense goes up  depreciation and amortization are non cash charges 
the other items excluded from adjusted ebitda are excluded in order to better reflect our continuing operations 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda  one should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments noted above 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these types of adjustments 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
our adjusted ebitda measure has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  it does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and our adjusted ebitda measure does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  it is not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows  it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  it does not reflect limitations on or costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us  and other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 
you should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance removes the presentation options in accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income  and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income 
asu defers the requirement in asu 
table of contents that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of aoci in both oci and net income on the face of the financial statements 
asu requires companies to continue to present amounts reclassified out of aoci on the face of the financial statements or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
asu also defers the requirement to report reclassification adjustments in interim periods and requires companies to present only total comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two consecutive statements in interim periods 
asu and asu will be effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december  the company elected to early adopt this asu as of march  in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
asu requires registrants to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we will reflect the impact of these amendments beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the period ending june  as the new standard does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements  our financial position  results of operations or cash flows will not be impacted 
there are currently no other accounting standards that have been issued that will have a significant impact on the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption 
effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of labor  equipment  and raw materials 
we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our business over the past three fiscal years except for the following discussion in commodity price risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our other borrowing activities  which had an outstanding balance as of march   of million 
this other debt has a variable interest rate and a change in the interest rate would yield a million change in interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk given our international operations and sales  we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates 
of these  the most significant are currently the euro and the mexican peso 
a portion of our sales to our customers and operating costs in europe are denominated in euro creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
also  a portion of our costs in our operations in mexico are denominated in mexican pesos  creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
additionally  certain of our non us subsidiaries make sales denominated in us dollars which expose them to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
historically  in order to minimize our exposure  we periodically entered into forward foreign exchange contracts in which the future cash flows were hedged against the us dollar 
the company does not presently have in place any forward foreign exchange contracts  but does periodically evaluate the use of such contracts as a means of hedging its foreign exchange exposure 

table of contents commodity price risk as a result of our tantalum vertical integration efforts which began in fiscal year  we have reduced our exposure to price volatility and supply uncertainty in the tantalum supply chain 
a majority of our tantalum needs are now met through our direct sourcing of conflict free tantalum ore or tantalum scrap reclaim  which is then processed into the intermediate product potassium heptafluorotantalate commonly known as k salt at our own facility in mexico or at a subcontractor site in south africa  before final processing into tantalum powder at blue powder 
price increases for tantalum ore  or for the remaining tantalum powder that we source from third parties  could impact our financial performance as we may be unable to pass all such price increases on to our customers 
palladium is a precious metal used in the manufacture of multilayer ceramic capacitors and is mined primarily in russia and south africa 
we continue to pursue ways to reduce palladium usage in ceramic capacitors in order to minimize the price risk 
the amount of palladium that we require has generally been available in sufficient quantities  however the price of palladium is driven by the market which has shown significant price fluctuations 
for instance  in fiscal year the price of palladium fluctuated between and per troy ounce 
price increases and the possibility of our inability to pass such increases on to our customers could have an adverse effect on profitability 
silver and aluminum have generally been available in sufficient quantities  and we believe there are a sufficient number of suppliers from which we can purchase our requirements 
an increase in the price of silver and aluminum that we are unable to pass on to our customers  however  could have an adverse effect on our profitability
