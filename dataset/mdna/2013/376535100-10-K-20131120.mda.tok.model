item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
historical financial condition and results of operations and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of financial condition or results of operations for any future periods 
except per share amounts  dollar amounts are in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
overview general we were incorporated under the maryland general corporation law on may  we operate as an externally managed  closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company bdc under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
in addition  for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ric under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
as a bdc and a ric  we are subject to certain constraints  including limitations imposed by the act and the code 
we were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private business operating in the united states us 
our investment objectives are to achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses  make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time  and provide our stockholders with long term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains 
to achieve our investment objectives  our investment strategy is to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities  with each investment generally ranging from million to million  although investment size may vary  depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment 
we also aim to maintain a portfolio allocation of approximately debt investment and equity investment  at cost 
we focus on investing in small and medium sized private businesses in the us that meet certain criteria  including  but not limited to  the following the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and  to a lesser extent  the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
we invest by ourselves or jointly with other funds and or management of the portfolio company  depending on the opportunity 
if we are participating in an investment with one or more co investors  our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone 
in general  our investments in debt securities have a term of no more than seven years  accrue interest at variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor and  to a lesser extent  at fixed rates 
we seek debt instruments that pay interest monthly or  at a minimum  quarterly  have a success fee or deferred interest provision and are primarily interest only with all principal and any accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity 
generally  success fees accrue at a set rate and are contractually due upon a change of control in the business 
some debt securities have deferred interest whereby some portion of the interest payment is added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind pik interest 
typically  our equity investments consist of common stock  preferred stock  limited liability company interests  or warrants to purchase the foregoing 
often  these equity investments occur in connection with our original investment  recapitalizing a business  or refinancing existing debt 
we are externally managed by our investment advisor  gladstone management corporation the adviser  a securities and exchange commission sec registered investment adviser and an affiliate of ours  pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement the advisory agreement 
the adviser manages our investment activities 
we have also entered into an administration agreement the administration agreement with gladstone administration  llc the administrator  an affiliate of ours and the adviser  whereby we pay separately for administrative services 
our shares of common stock and term preferred stock are traded on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the trading symbols glad and gladp  respectively 
business environment the strength of the global economy and the us economy in particular  continues to be uncertain and volatile 
recently  we experienced the first us government shutdown in years along with a stalemate in the us congress over whether to raise the debt ceiling 
the us government budget concerns remain until early when the us congress will revisit the debt ceiling debate again 
prior to this recent us fiscal crisis  economic conditions generally appeared to be improving  albeit slowly  since the recession 
we have continued to remain cautious about a long term economic recovery 
the impacts from the recession in general  and the resulting disruptions in the capital markets in particular  have had lingering effects on our liquidity options and increased our cost of debt and equity capital 
many of our portfolio companies  as well as those small and medium sized companies that we evaluate for investment  are still feeling the adverse impacts of these political and economic conditions  and if these conditions persist  it may affect their ability to repay our loans or engage in a liquidity event  such as a sale  recapitalization or initial public offering 
these political and economic conditions could also disproportionately impact some of the industries in which we have invested  causing us to be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio  which could cause the number of our non performing assets to increase and the fair market value of our portfolio to decrease 
in addition  there has been increased competitive pressure in the bdc and investment company marketplace for senior and senior subordinated debt  resulting in lower yields for increasingly riskier investments 
we believe we are in a protracted economic recovery  however  we do not know if market conditions will continue to improve or if adverse conditions will again intensify  and we do not know the full extent to which the inability of the us government to address its fiscal condition in the near and long term will affect us 
if market instability persists or intensifies  we may experience difficulty in raising capital 
in summary  we believe that are in a protracted economic recovery  but that the recent us fiscal crisis has temporarily suppressed that recovery 
we do not know the full extent to which the impact of the lingering recessionary economic conditions will affect us or our portfolio companies 
portfolio activity while conditions remain somewhat challenging in the marketplace  we are seeing a number of new investment opportunities that are consistent with our investment objectives and strategies 
during the year ended september   we invested in new proprietary and syndicate investments totaling million  however  we experienced a net contraction in our overall portfolio of three portfolio companies  primarily due to portfolio companies paying off early during the year  for an aggregate of million in unscheduled payoffs 
subsequent to september   we invested million in one new proprietary investment  as discussed under investment highlights 
in addition  in july  the sec granted us an exemptive order that expands our ability to co invest with certain of our affiliates by permitting us  under certain circumstances  to co invest with gladstone investment corporation gladstone investment and any future business development company or closed end management investment company that is advised by the adviser or sub advised by the adviser if it controls the fund or any combination of the foregoing subject to the conditions in the sec s order 
we believe this ability to co invest will enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies 
we co invested with gladstone investment in two new proprietary investments one in each of may and october  as discussed under investment highlights 
regulatory compliance challenges in the current market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the code and the act  as well as contractual restrictions under the agreement governing our million revolving line of credit our credit facility  described more fully under revolving credit facility below that further constrain our ability to access the capital markets 
to qualify to be taxed as a ric  we must distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of our net short term capital gains over net long term capital losses 
because we are required to satisfy the ric annual stockholder distribution requirement  and because the illiquidity of many of our investments makes it difficult for us to finance new investments through the sale of current investments  our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing 
our external financing sources include the issuance of equity securities  debt securities or other leverage  such as borrowings under our credit facility 
our ability to seek external debt financing  to the extent that it is available under current market conditions  is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the act that require us to have an asset coverage ratio as defined in section h of the act of at least on our senior securities representing indebtedness and our senior securities that are stock  to which we refer collectively as senior securities 
we believe that market conditions have affected the trading price of our common stock and our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity 
on november   the closing market price of our common stock was  a discount to our september   net asset value nav per share of 
when our stock trades below nav per common share  as it has consistently traded over the last four years  our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the act  which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock below nav per common share without stockholder approval  other than through sales to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on february   our stockholders approved a proposal which authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current nav per common share subject to certain limitations including  but not limited to  that the number of shares issued and sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale for a period of one year from the date of approval  provided that our board of directors our board of directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale 
at the upcoming annual stockholders meeting scheduled for february   our stockholders will again be asked to vote in favor of renewing this proposal for another year 
the current uncertain and volatile economic conditions may also continue to cause the value of the collateral securing some of our loans to fluctuate  as well as the value of our equity investments  which has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
additionally  our credit facility contains covenants regarding the maintenance of certain minimum loan concentrations and net worth  which are affected by the decrease in value of our portfolio 
failure to meet these requirements would result in a default which  if we are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders  would cause an acceleration of our repayment obligations under our credit facility 
as of september   we were in compliance with all of our credit facility s covenants 
we expect that  given these regulatory and contractual constraints in combination with current market conditions  debt and equity capital may be costly for us to access in the near term 
however  we believe that our recent amendments to our credit facility to decrease the interest rate on advances and extend its maturity until and our ability to co invest with gladstone investment and certain other affiliated investment funds  should increase our ability to make investments in businesses that we believe will be generally resistant to a recession and  as a result  will be likely to achieve attractive long term returns for our stockholders 
see recent developments for more information on these transactions 
going into fiscal  we will continue to focus on building our pipeline and making investments that meet our objectives and strategies and that provide appropriate returns  given the risks

during the year ended september   we paid million of dividends on our term preferred stock 
we classify these dividends as dividend expense on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there was no preferred stock dividends paid in the year ended september   as our term preferred stock offering occurred in november interest expense increased by million for the year ended september   as compared to the prior year  due primarily to increased borrowings under our credit facility to facilitate the increased investment activity during the year 
the weighted average balance outstanding on our credit facility during the year ended september   was approximately million  as compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
other expenses increased by million during the year ended september   as compared to the prior year  primarily due to expenses of million being recognized for the termination of an equity distribution agreement  discussed in detail under liquidity and capital resources equity further below and also due to increases in bad debt expense related to receivables from certain portfolio companies 
the decrease of million in net incentive fees earned by the adviser during the years ended september   as compared to the prior year  was due primarily to the increase in the incentive fee waiver in the fiscal year 
incentive fees were earned by the adviser during the years ended september  and  however  the incentive fees were partially waived by the adviser to ensure distributions to stockholders were covered entirely by net investment income during both years

during the quarter ended march   we restructured our investment in sunshine and took a controlling position 
in addition  there was unrealized depreciation on newhall of million  viapack of million and lindmark of million  all primarily due to a decline in the financial and operational performance of these portfolio companies during the year ended september  partially offsetting the unrealized depreciation was the unrealized appreciation of million on defiance  which resulted from an improvement in portfolio company performance and in certain comparable multiples 
of note  subsequent to september   newhall and viapack were sold and substantially all of lindmark s assets were sold and its debt outstanding at the time was repaid in full at par 
as of september   the fair value of our investment portfolio was less than its cost basis by approximately million  and our entire investment portfolio was valued at of cost  as compared to cumulative net unrealized depreciation of million and a valuation of our entire portfolio at of cost as of september  this increase year over year in the cumulative unrealized depreciation on investments represents net unrealized depreciation of million for the year ended september  of the investment portfolio as of september   portfolio companies originated before december   which represented of the entire cost basis of the portfolio  were valued at of cost and included the six investments that were on non accrual status 
of the investment portfolio as of september   portfolio companies that originated after december   representing of the entire cost basis of our portfolio  were valued at of cost and none of which were on non accrual status 
we believe that our aggregate investment portfolio was valued at a depreciated value as of september   primarily due to the lingering effects of the recession that began in and its affect on the performance of certain of our portfolio companies and also because we were invested in certain industries that have been disproportionately impacted by the recession 
the cumulative net unrealized depreciation of our investments does not have an impact on our current ability to pay distributions to stockholders  however  it may be an indication of future realized losses  which could ultimately reduce our income available for distribution to stockholders 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation of borrowings net unrealized appreciation depreciation of borrowings is the net change in the fair value of our credit facility during the year  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains and losses are realized

liquidity and capital resources operating activities our cash flows from operations generally come from the interest payments on debt securities that we receive from our portfolio companies  as well as cash proceeds received through repayments or sales of our investments 
we utilize this cash primarily to pay interest payments on our credit facility  distributions to our stockholders  management fees to the adviser  and other operating expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september   was million as compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in repayments on investments  partially offset by an increase in purchases of investments during the year ended september  for the year ended september   net cash used in operating activities was million  which was primarily driven by increased new investment activity during fiscal year as of september   we had loans to  syndicated participations in and or equity investments in private companies  with an aggregate cost basis of approximately million

these financing activities were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of our term preferred stock of million in november net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  was million and primarily consisted of net borrowings on our credit facility of million  partially offset by distributions to common stockholders of million 
distributions to stockholders common stock distributions to qualify to be taxed as a ric and thus avoid corporate level federal income tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required to distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least of our investment company taxable income 
in accordance with these requirements  we declared and paid monthly cash distributions of per common share for each month during the years ended september   and  which totaled an aggregate of million  million and million  respectively 
in october  our board of directors declared a monthly distribution of per common share for each of october  november and december our board of directors declared these distributions to our stockholders based on our estimates of net investment income for the fiscal year ending september  additionally  the covenants in our credit facility restrict the amount of distributions to stockholders that we can pay out to be no greater than our net investment income in each fiscal year 
as of september   we have paid consecutive monthly cash distributions and prior to that  we paid consecutive quarterly cash distributions 
for each of the years ended september  and  common stockholder distributions declared and paid exceeded our current and accumulated earnings and profits after taking into account our term preferred stock dividends  which resulted in a partial return of capital of approximately million and million  respectively 
the returns of capital resulted primarily from accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap realized losses being recognized as ordinary losses for federal income tax purposes in each of those fiscal years 
our accumulated earnings and profits exceeded common stockholder distributions declared and paid for the year ended september   and we therefore elected to treat million of common distributions paid in fiscal year as having been paid in fiscal year preferred stock distributions we also declared and paid monthly cash distributions of per share of term preferred stock for each month during the year ended september   which totaled an aggregate of million 
in october  our board of directors declared a monthly distribution of per share of term preferred stock for each of october  november and december during the year ended september   we declared and paid monthly cash distributions of per share of term preferred stock for a prorated period in november and for each month from december through september  which totaled an aggregate of million 
in accordance with gaap  we treat these monthly distributions to preferred stockholders as an operating expense 
for federal income tax purposes  distributions paid by us to preferred stockholders generally constitute ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
dividend reinvestment plan we offer a dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders through our transfer agent  computershare  inc this is an opt in dividend reinvestment plan  meaning that common stockholders may elect to have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock 
common stockholders who do not so elect will receive their dividends in cash 
common stockholders who receive distributions in the form of stock will be subject to the same federal  state and local tax consequences as stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash 
the common stockholder will have an adjusted basis in the additional common shares purchased through the plan equal to the amount of the reinvested distribution 
the additional shares will have a new holding period commencing on the day following the date on which the shares are credited to the common stockholder s account 
we do not have a dividend reinvestment plan for our preferred stock stockholders 
equity registration statement on november   we filed our registration statement on form n file no 
that was amended on january   and which the sec declared effective on january  our registration statement is a universal shelf registration statement and permits us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities  consisting of common stock  preferred stock  subscription rights  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock  including through a combined offering of such securities 
we have not issued any securities to date under our registration statement 
common stock on may   we and the adviser entered into an equity distribution agreement the agreement with bb t capital markets  a division of scott stringfellow  llc the agent  under which we could  from time to time  issue and sell through the agent  as sales agent  up to million shares of our common stock  par value per share 
in october  we terminated this agreement 
no shares were ever issued pursuant to this agreement 
prepaid costs of million related to the origination of this agreement were expensed in the three months ended september  we anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future 
however  we cannot determine the terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us  or at all 
additionally  when our common stock is trading below nav  as it has consistently over the last four years  the act restricts our ability to obtain additional capital by issuing common stock 
generally  the act provides that we may not issue and sell our common stock at a price below our then current nav per common share  other than to our then existing common stockholders pursuant to a rights offering  without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors 
as of september   our nav per common share was and as of november  our closing market price was per common share 
to the extent that our common stock continues to trade at a market price below our nav per common share  we will generally be precluded from raising equity capital through public offerings of our common stock  other than pursuant to stockholder approval or a rights offering to existing common stockholders 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on february   our stockholders approved a proposal that authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current nav per common share for a period of one year from the date of such approval  provided that our board of directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale 
at the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for february   our stockholders will again be asked to vote in favor of renewing this proposal for another year 
we have not issued any common stock since february and have never issued common stock below the then current nav per common share 
term preferred stock pursuant to our prior registration statement  in november  we completed an offering of million shares of term preferred stock at a public offering price of per share 
gross proceeds totaled million and net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses borne by us were approximately million and were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we incurred million in total offering costs related to these transactions  which have been recorded as an asset in accordance with gaap and amortized over the redemption period ending december  no preferred stock had been issued prior to this issuance and we have not issued any additional preferred stock since november our term preferred stock provides for a fixed dividend equal to per year  payable monthly which equates to approximately million per year 
we are required to redeem all of our outstanding term preferred stock on december  for cash at a redemption price equal to per share plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends  if any  to the date of redemption 
our term preferred stock has a preference over our common stock with respect to these dividends  whereby no distributions are payable on our common stock unless the stated dividends  including any accrued and unpaid dividends  on our term preferred stock have been paid in full 
in addition  the two other potential redemption triggers for our term preferred stock are as follows if we fail to maintain an asset coverage ratio as calculated under section h of the act of at least  we are required to redeem a portion of our outstanding term preferred stock or otherwise cure the ratio redemption trigger  and at our sole option  at any time on or after december  no redemptions of our outstanding term preferred stock have been made to date 
our term preferred stock has been recorded as a liability in accordance with gaap and  as such  affects our asset coverage  exposing us to additional leverage risks 
in addition  our term preferred stock is not convertible into our common stock or any other security 
our term preferred stock is currently traded on the nasdaq with a trading symbol of gladp 
revolving credit facility on april   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  business loan  entered into amendment no

our million revolving credit facility was arranged by key equipment finance inc key equipment as administrative agent 
keybank national association keybank  branch banking and trust company and ing capital llc also joined our credit facility as committed lenders 
subject to certain terms and conditions  our credit facility may be expanded from to a maximum of million through the addition of other committed lenders to the facility 
the interest rates on advances under our credit facility generally bear interest at a day libor plus per annum  with a commitment fee of per annum on undrawn amounts when our facility is drawn more than and per annum on undrawn amounts when our facility is drawn less than 
if our credit facility is not renewed or extended by the maturity date  all principal and interest will be due and payable on or before november  we incurred fees of million in april in connection with this amendment  which are being amortized through the maturity date of our credit facility 
all other terms of our credit facility remained generally unchanged at the time of this amendment 
prior to the april  amendment  on january   we  through business loan  amended our credit facility to remove the libor minimum of on advances 
in addition  on january   we  through business loan  amended our credit facility to extend the then current maturity date of our revolving line of credit from march  to january   which has subsequently been amended to january   as described above 
we incurred fees of million in january and million in january in connection with these amendments  which are being amortized through the maturity date of our credit facility 
all other terms of our credit facility remained generally unchanged at the time of these amendments 
interest is payable monthly during the term of our credit facility 
available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed under our credit facility  based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by business loan  which varies as loans are added and repaid  regardless of whether such repayments are prepayments or made as contractually required 
our credit facility also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with key equipment as custodian 
key equipment  who also serves as the trustee of the account  generally remits the collected funds to us once a month 
our credit facility contains covenants that require business loan to maintain its status as a separate legal entity  prohibit certain significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies 
our credit facility also limits payments of distributions to our stockholders to aggregate net investment income for each of the twelve month periods ending september     and business loan is also subject to certain limitations on the type of loan investments it can apply as collateral towards the borrowing base in order to receive additional borrowing availability under our credit facility  including restrictions on geographic concentrations  sector concentrations  loan size  interest rate type  payment frequency and status  average life and lien property 
our credit facility further requires business loan to comply with other financial and operational covenants  which obligate business loan to  among other things  maintain certain financial ratios  including asset and interest coverage and a required minimum number of obligors in the borrowing base of our credit facility 
additionally  we are subject to a performance guaranty that requires us to maintain i a minimum net worth defined in our credit facility to include our term preferred stock of million plus of all equity and subordinated debt raised after january   which equates to million as of september   ii asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least  in accordance with section of the act and iii our status as a bdc under the act and as a ric under the code 
as of september   and as defined in the performance guaranty of our credit facility  we had a net worth of million  an asset coverage of and an active status as a bdc and ric 
in addition  we had obligors in the borrowing base of our credit facility as of september  as of september   we were in compliance with all of our credit facility covenants 
on july   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  business loan  entered into an interest rate cap agreement with keybank  effective july  and expiring january   for a notional amount of million that effectively limits the interest rate on a portion of our borrowings under our revolving line of credit pursuant to the terms of our credit facility 
the one month libor cap is set at 
we incurred a premium fee of in conjunction with this agreement 
beginning with the quarter ending september   we have recorded the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement in other assets in our accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and the change in the fair value based on the current market valuations at quarter end in net unrealized appreciation depreciation of other in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we have lines of credit with certain of our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn 
since these commitments have expiration dates and we expect many will never be fully drawn  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
in addition to the lines of credit with our portfolio companies  we  from time to time  have also extended certain guarantees on behalf of some our portfolio companies during the normal course of business 
as of september   we were not party to any guarantees 
when investing in certain private equity funds  we may have uncalled capital commitments depending on the agreed upon terms of our committed ownership interest 
these capital commitments usually have a specific date in the future set as a closing date  at which time the commitment is either funded or terminates 
as of september   we had uncalled capital commitments related to our partnership interest in leeds novamark capital i  lp we estimate the fair value of our unused line of credit and uncalled capital commitments and our guarantee as of september  to be minimal  and therefore  they are not recorded on our accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities 
the following table shows our contractual obligations as of september  at cost payments due by period contractual obligations a less than year years years more than years total credit facility b term preferred stock interest expense on debt obligations c total a excludes our unused line of credit and uncalled capital commitments to our portfolio companies in an aggregate amount of million as of september  b principal balance of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  based on the current contractual maturity due to the revolving nature of the facility 
c includes estimated interest payments on our credit facility and dividend obligations on our term preferred stock 
the amount of interest expense calculated for purposes of this table was based upon rates and balances as of september  dividend payments on our term preferred stock assume quarterly dividend declarations and monthly dividend distributions through the date of mandatory redemption 
of our interest bearing debt investments as of september   had a success fee component  which enhances the yield on our debt investments 
unlike pik income  we do not recognize success fees as income until they are received in cash 
as a result  as of september   we have an aggregate off balance sheet success fee receivable of million  or approximately per common share  on our accruing debt investments that would be owed to us based on our current portfolio if fully paid off 
due to their contingent nature  there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect all of these success fees or know the timing of such collections 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the years reported 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified our investment valuation process as our most critical accounting policy 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our accompanying consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
the financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurement and disclosures  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
asc provides a consistent definition of fair value that focuses on exit price in the principal  or most advantageous  market and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
asc also establishes the following three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active or inactive markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs are in those markets for which there are few transactions  the prices are not current  little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers  and level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
unobservable inputs are those inputs that reflect assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and can include the adviser s assumptions based upon the best available information 
our investment portfolio is comprised of debt and equity securities of privately held companies for which quoted prices or other inputs falling within the categories of level and level are generally not available 
therefore  as of september  and  all of our investments were valued using level inputs 
see note investments in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our application of asc the adviser uses generally accepted valuation techniques to value our portfolio unless it has specific information about the value of an investment to determine otherwise 
from time to time  the adviser may accept an appraisal of a business in which we hold securities 
these appraisals are expensive and occur infrequently but provide a third party valuation opinion that may differ in results  techniques and scopes used to value our investments 
when these specific third party appraisals are engaged or accepted  the adviser would use estimates of value provided by such appraisals and its own assumptions including estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities  as of the measurement date  to value our investments 
the recorded fair values of our investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
general valuation policy in determining the value of our investments  the adviser has established an investment valuation policy the policy 
the policy has been approved by our board of directors  and each quarter our board of directors reviews whether the adviser has applied the policy consistently and votes whether or not to accept the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
the adviser values our investments in accordance with the requirements of the act 
as discussed more fully below  the adviser values securities for which market quotations are readily available and reliable at their market value 
the adviser values all other securities and assets at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
the policy  which is summarized below  applies to the following categories of securities publicly traded securities  securities for which a limited market exists  and securities for which no market exists 
valuation method publicly traded securities the adviser determines the value of publicly traded securities based on the closing price for the security on the exchange or securities market on which it is listed and primarily traded on the valuation date 
to the extent that we own a restricted security that is not freely tradable  but for which a public market otherwise exists  the adviser will use the market value of that security adjusted for any decrease in value resulting from the restrictive feature 
as of september  and  we did not have any investments in publicly traded securities 
securities for which a limited market exists the adviser values securities that are not traded on an established secondary securities market  but for which a limited market for the security exists  such as certain participations in  or assignments of  syndicated loans  at the quoted bid price  which are non binding 
in valuing these assets  the adviser assesses trading activity in an asset class  evaluates variances in prices and other market insights to determine if any available quote prices are reliable 
if the adviser concludes that quotes based on active markets or trading activity may be relied upon  firm bid prices are requested  however  if a firm bid price is unavailable  the adviser bases the value of the security upon the indicative bid price ibp offered by the respective originating syndication agent s trading desk  or secondary desk  on or near the valuation date 
to the extent that the adviser uses the ibp as a basis for valuing the security  it may take further steps to consider additional information to validate that price in accordance with the policy  including but not limited to reviewing a range of indicative bids to the extent it has ready access to such qualified information 
in the event these limited markets become illiquid such that market prices are no longer readily available  the adviser will value our syndicated loans using alternative methods  such as estimated net present values of the future cash flows or discounted cash flows dcf 
the use of a dcf methodology follows that prescribed by asc  which provides guidance on the use of a reporting entity s own assumptions about future cash flows and risk adjusted discount rates when relevant observable inputs  such as quotes in active markets  are not available 
when relevant observable market data does not exist  the alternative outlined in asc is the valuation of investments based on dcf 
for the purposes of using dcf to provide fair value estimates  the adviser considers multiple inputs such as a risk adjusted discount rate that incorporates adjustments that market participants would make both for nonperformance and liquidity risks 
as such  the adviser develops a modified discount rate approach that incorporates risk premiums including  among others  increased probability of default  or higher loss given default  or increased liquidity risk 
the dcf valuations applied to the syndicated loans provide an estimate of what the adviser believes a market participant would pay to purchase a syndicated loan in an active market  thereby establishing a fair value 
the adviser applies the dcf methodology in illiquid markets until quoted prices are available or are deemed reliable based on trading activity 
as of september  and  the adviser determined that the ibps were reliable indicators of fair value for our syndicate investments 
however  because of the private nature of this marketplace meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported  we believe that these valuation inputs are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc securities for which no market exists the valuation methodology for securities for which no market exists falls into four categories a portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities  b portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of securities  which can include debt and equity securities  c portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities  and d portfolio investments comprised of non publicly traded non control equity securities of other funds 
a portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities debt securities that are not publicly traded on an established securities market  or for which a limited market does not exist non public debt securities  and that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity or equity like securities  are fair valued utilizing estimates of value submitted to the adviser by standard poor s securities evaluations  inc spse and its own assumptions in the absence of observable market data  including synthetic credit ratings  estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date 
the adviser may also submit pik interest to spse for their evaluation when it is determined that pik interest is likely to be received 
in the case of non public debt securities  the adviser has engaged spse to submit opinions of value for our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies in which we own no equity  or equity like securities 
spse will only evaluate the debt portion of our investments for which the adviser specifically requests evaluation  and may decline to make requested evaluations for any reason at its sole discretion 
upon completing the adviser s collection of data with respect to the investments which may include the information described below under credit information  the risk ratings of the loans described below under loan grading and risk rating and the factors described hereunder  this valuation data is forwarded to spse for review and analysis 
spse makes its independent assessment of the data that the adviser has assembled and assesses its independent data to form an opinion as to what they consider to be the market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  spse has issued the following paragraph spse provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what spse believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects spse s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  however  spse cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimates thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  spse cannot guarantee their accuracy 
spse opinions of value of our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity or equity like securities are submitted to our board of directors along with the adviser s supplemental assessment and recommendation regarding valuation of each of these investments 
the adviser generally accepts the opinion of value given by spse  however  in certain limited circumstances  such as when the adviser may learn new information regarding an investment between the time of submission to spse and the date of the board assessment the adviser s conclusions as to value may differ from the opinion of value delivered by spse 
our board of directors then reviews whether the adviser has followed its established procedures for determinations of fair value  and votes to accept or reject the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
the adviser and our management recommended  and the board of directors voted to accept  the opinions of value delivered by spse on the loans in our portfolio as denoted on our consolidated schedule of investments included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
because there is a delay between when we close an investment and when the investment can be evaluated by spse  new loans are not valued immediately by spse  rather  the adviser makes its own determination about the value of these investments in accordance with our valuation policy using the methods described herein 
b portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities the fair value of these investments is determined based on the total enterprise value tev of the portfolio company  or issuer  utilizing a liquidity waterfall approach 
for non public debt securities and equity or equity like securities eg preferred equity  common equity  or other equity like securities that are purchased together as part of a package  where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security  both the debt and equity securities of the portfolio investment would exit in the mergers and acquisitions market as the principal market  generally through a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
we generally exit the debt and equity securities of one issuer together 
applying the liquidity waterfall approach to all of the investments of an issuer  the adviser first calculates the tev of the issuer by incorporating some or all of the following factors the issuer s ability to make payments  the earnings of the issuer  recent sales to third parties of similar securities  the comparison to publicly traded securities  and dcf or other pertinent factors 
in gathering the sales to third parties of similar securities  the adviser may reference industry statistics and use outside experts  tev is only an estimate of value and may not be the value received in an actual sale 
once the adviser has estimated the tev of the issuer  it subtracts the value of all the debt securities of the issuer  which are valued at the contractual principal balance 
fair values of these debt securities are discounted for any shortfall of tev over the total debt outstanding for the issuer 
once the values for all outstanding senior securities which include the debt securities have been subtracted from the tev of the issuer  the remaining amount  if any  is used to determine the value of the issuer s equity or equity like securities 
if  in the adviser s judgment  the liquidity waterfall approach does not accurately reflect the value of the debt component  the adviser may recommend that we use a valuation by spse or  if that is unavailable  a dcf valuation technique 
c portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities the adviser values non public debt securities that are purchased together with equity or equity like securities from the same portfolio company  or issuer  for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  using a hypothetical secondary market as our principal market 
in accordance with asc as amended by the fasb s accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  asu  the adviser has defined our unit of account at the investment level either debt or equity and therefore it determines the fair value of these non control investments assuming the sale of an individual security using the stand alone premise of value 
as such  the adviser estimates the fair value of the debt component using estimates of value provided by spse and its own assumptions in the absence of observable market data  including synthetic credit ratings  estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date 
for equity or equity like securities of investments for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  the adviser estimates the fair value of the equity based on factors such as the overall value of the issuer  the relative fair value of other units of account including debt  or other relative value approaches 
consideration also is given to capital structure and other contractual obligations that may impact the fair value of the equity 
furthermore  the adviser may utilize comparable values of similar companies  recent investments and indices with similar structures and risk characteristics or dcf valuation techniques and  in absence of other observable market data  its own assumptions 
d portfolio investments comprised of non publicly traded non control equity securities of other funds the adviser generally values any uninvested capital of the non control fund at par value and value any invested capital at the nav provided by the non control fund 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly and materially from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that the adviser might reasonably expect us to receive upon the current sale of the security in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
valuation considerations from time to time  depending on certain circumstances  the adviser may use the following valuation considerations  including but not limited to the nature and realizable value of the collateral  the portfolio company s earnings and cash flows and its ability to make payments on its obligations  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  the comparison to publicly traded companies  and dcf and other relevant factors 
because such valuations  particularly valuations of private securities and private companies  are not susceptible to precise determination  may fluctuate over short periods of time  and may be based on estimates  the adviser s determinations of fair value may differ from the values that might have actually resulted had a readily available market for these securities been available 
credit information the adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
generally  we  through the adviser  participate in periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold voting securities and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements 
using these statements or comparable information and board discussions  the adviser calculates and evaluates the credit statistics 
loan grading and risk rating as part of the adviser s valuation procedures above  it risk rates all of our investments in debt securities 
the adviser does not risk rate our equity securities 
for syndicated loans that have been rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro as defined in rule a under the act  the adviser uses the nrsro s risk rating for such security 
for all other debt securities  the adviser uses a proprietary risk rating system 
the adviser s risk rating system uses a scale of to  with being the lowest probability of default 
this system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the expected loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
for the debt securities for which the adviser does not use a third party nrsro risk rating  the adviser seeks to have its risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations  such as those provided by an nrsro 
while the adviser seeks to mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that the adviser s risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as an nrsro for these securities 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of the adviser s risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because the adviser s system rates debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro  there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
the adviser believes its risk rating would be higher than a typical nrsro risk rating because the risk rating of the typical nrsro is designed for larger businesses 
however  the adviser s risk rating has been designed to risk rate the securities of smaller businesses that are not rated by a typical nrsro 
therefore  when the adviser uses its risk rating on larger business securities  the risk rating is higher than a typical nrsro rating 
the adviser believes the primary difference between its risk rating and the rating of a typical nrsro is that the adviser s risk rating uses more quantitative determinants and includes qualitative determinants that it believes are not used in the nrsro rating 
it is the adviser s understanding that most debt securities of medium sized companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on an nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  the adviser s scale begins with the designation as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a bbb from an nrsro  however  no assurance can be given that a on the adviser s scale is equal to a bbb on an nrsro scale 
the scale below gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
adviser s system first nrsro second nrsro description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set forth are for a ten year term debt security 
if a debt security is less than ten years  then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period  which may move the security higher on our risk rating scale 
the following table lists the risk ratings for all non syndicated loans in our portfolio at september  and  representing approximately and  respectively  of the principal balance of all debt investments in our portfolio at the end of each year as of september  rating highest average weighted average lowest for syndicated loans that are currently rated by an nrsro  the adviser risk rates such loans in accordance with the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations  such as those provided by an nrsro

at september  and  these loans represented and  respectively  of the principal balance of all debt investments in our portfolio at the end of each year as of september  rating highest average weighted average lowest tax status we intend to continue to maintain our qualification as a ric under subchapter m of the code for federal income tax purposes 
as a ric  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to our stockholders 
to maintain our qualification as a ric  we must meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements 
in addition  in order to qualify to be taxed as a ric  we must also meet certain annual stockholder distribution requirements 
to satisfy the ric annual distribution requirement  we must distribute to stockholders at least of our investment company taxable income 
our policy generally is to make distributions to our stockholders in an amount up to of our investment company taxable income 
in an effort to limit certain federal excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute to our stockholders  during each calendar year  an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gain net income for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year  and any ordinary income and capital gain net income from preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
under the ric modernization act the ric act  we are permitted to carryforward capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after september   for an unlimited period 
however  any losses incurred during those future taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to the losses incurred in pre enactment taxable years  which carry an expiration date 
as a result of this ordering rule  pre enactment capital loss carryforwards may be more likely to expire unused 
additionally  post enactment capital loss carryforwards will retain their character as either short term or long term capital losses rather than being considered all short term as permitted under the previous regulation 
we sought and received approval for a change in accounting method from the internal revenue service related to our tax treatment for success fees 
as a result  we  in effect  will continue to account for the recognition of income from the success fees upon receipt  or when the amount becomes fixed 
however  starting january   the tax characterization of the success fee amount was and will continue to be treated as ordinary income 
prior to january   we had treated the success fee amount as a capital gain for tax characterization purposes 
the approved change in accounting method does not require us to retroactively change the capital gains treatment of the success fees received prior to january  revenue recognition interest income recognition interest income  adjusted for amortization of premiums  acquisition costs and amendment fees and the accretion of original issue discounts oid  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
generally  when a loan becomes days or more past due or if our qualitative assessment indicates that the debtor is unable to service its debt or other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
however  we remain contractually entitled to this interest 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to the cost basis depending upon management s judgment 
generally  non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid and  in management s judgment  are likely to remain current  or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
at september   two portfolio companies were on non accrual status with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately million  or of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio  and an aggregate fair value of approximately million  or of the fair value of all debt investments in our portfolio 
at september   six portfolio companies were either fully or partially on non accrual status with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately million  or of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio  and an aggregate fair value of approximately million  or of the fair value of all debt investments in our portfolio 
we currently hold  and we expect to hold in the future  some loans in our portfolio that contain oid or pik provisions 
we recognize oid for loans originally issued at discounts and recognize the income over the life of the obligation based on an effective yield calculation 
pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in a loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of a loan and recorded as income over the life of the obligation 
thus  the actual collection of pik income may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment 
to maintain our ability to be taxed as a ric  we may need to pay out both of our oid and pik non cash income amounts in the form of distributions  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
as of september  and  we had and oid loans  respectively  primarily from the syndicated loans in our portfolio 
we recorded oid income of million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the unamortized balance of oid investments as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively 
as of september   we had three investments which had a pik interest component and as of september   we had one investment which had a pik interest component 
we recorded pik interest income of million  and for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we collected no pik interest in cash for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we also transfer past due interest to the principal balance as stipulated in certain loan amendments with portfolio companies 
there were no such transfers during the years ended september  and we transferred past due interest to the principal balance of million for the year ended september  other income recognition we generally record success fees upon receipt of cash 
success fees are contractually due upon a change of control in a portfolio company 
we received an aggregate of million in success fees during the year ended september   which resulted from the early payoffs at par of westlake for million in december and cmi for million in september we received an aggregate of million in success fees during the year ended september   which resulted from the early payoffs at par of winchester for million  gmt for million  rcs for million and northern contours for million 
during the year ended september   we received an aggregate of million in success fees from the early payoffs at par of pinnacle for million and interfilm for million and also a prepaid success fee of million from westlake 
as of september  and  we had an aggregate off balance sheet success fee receivable of approximately million and million  respectively  on our accruing debt investments 
we generally record prepayment fees upon receipt of cash 
prepayment fees are contractually due at the time of an investment s exit  based on the prepayment penalty fee schedule 
during the year ended september   we received an aggregate of million in prepayment fees  which resulted from the early payoffs of eight of our syndicated investments at par during the fiscal year 
we received an aggregate of million in prepayment fees during the year ended september   which resulted from the early payoffs of five of our syndicated investments at par during the fiscal year  and no prepayment fees were received during the year ended september  dividend income on preferred equity investments is accrued to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected and if we have the option to collect such amounts in cash 
during the years ended september   and we did not record or collect any dividend income on our preferred equity investments 
success fees  prepayment fees and dividend income are all recorded in other income in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we received an aggregate of million from two legal settlements related to portfolio companies during the year ended september   that were also recorded in other income during the fiscal year 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a description and our application of recent accounting pronouncements 
our adoption of these recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands  unless otherwise indicated market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events  including those directly involving the companies whose securities are owned by us  conditions affecting the general economy  overall market changes  local  regional or global political  social or economic instability  and interest rate fluctuations 
the primary risk we believe we are exposed to is interest rate risk 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
we use a combination of debt and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques from time to time to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we target to have approximately of the loans in our portfolio at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates or variable rates with a floor 
as of september   our portfolio consisted of the following variable rates with a libor or prime rate floor fixed rates variable rates without a floor total all of our variable rate loans have rates generally associated with either the current libor or prime rate 
in july  we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  business loan  entered into an interest rate cap agreement with keybank  effective july  and expiring january   for a notional amount of million that effectively limits the interest rate on a portion of our borrowings under our revolving line of credit pursuant to the terms of our credit facility 
this agreement will entitle us to receive payments  if any  equal to the amount by which interest payments on the current notational amount at the one month libor exceed the payments on the current notional amount at 
the agreement therefore helps mitigate our exposure to increases in interest rates on our borrowings on the credit facility  which are at variable rates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments interest rate cap agreement for further discussion 
as of september   the interest rate cap agreement had a minimal fair value 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations  we have performed the following hypothetical analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet and interest rates remain constant as of september  and no further actions are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
basis point change a increase in interest income increase decrease in interest expense net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points a as of september   our effective average libor was 
although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from those in the hypothetical analysis in the table above 
we may also experience risk associated with investing in securities of companies with foreign operations 
some of our portfolio companies have operations located outside the us these risks include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  imposition of foreign taxes  changes in exportation regulations and political and social instability
