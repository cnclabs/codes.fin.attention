these factors include  but are not necessarily limited to those risks set forth in item a of this annual report on form k 
words such as projects  believe  plan  anticipate and expect and similar expressions are intended to qualify as forward looking statements 
medifast  inc cautions investors not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only to management expectations on this date 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements even if actual results may differ from projections 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management develops  and changes periodically  these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management considers the following accounting estimates to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized net of discounts  rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  and estimated returns and upon transfer of title and risk to the customer which occurs at shipping fob terms 
upon shipment  the company has no further performance obligations and collection is reasonably assured as the majority of sales are paid for prior to shipping 
medifast weight control centers program fees are recognized over the estimated service period 
the balance of deferred revenue on the balance sheet is million as of december   an increase of million in comparison to december  impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets we continually assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and our operating performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and the carrying values of fixed and intangible assets may be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss would be limited to the value of net fixed and intangible assets 
income taxes the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
we evaluated our tax positions and determined that we did not have any material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition of a liability 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense 
for the twelve months ended december  and  no material estimated interest or penalties were recognized for the uncertainty of certain tax positions 
we file income tax returns in the united states and various states jurisdictions 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before reserves for returns we review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time 
to estimate reserves for returns  we consider actual return rates in preceding periods 
to the extent the estimate of returns changes  we will adjust the reserve  which will impact the amount of product sales revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment 
our estimates for returns have not differed materially from our actual returns 
the provision for estimated returns as of december  and were  and  respectively 
operating leases medifast leases retail stores  distribution facilities  and office space under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
we commence recording rent expense on the date of initial possession  which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements to properties for our intended use 
for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays  we record a deferred rent liability on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the consolidated statements of income 
for scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy  we record minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases on the consolidated statements of income 
several leases provide for contingent rents  which are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels 
we record a contingent rent liability on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when we determine achieving specified levels is probable
