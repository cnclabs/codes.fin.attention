item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
despite the relative increase in capital project spending in certain limited markets  we believe that overall  client spending continues to be limited  which we believe may be due to the uncertainty experienced by businesses regarding the political climate in washington dc and the sluggish improvement in the economy overall 
in addition  pricing continues to be very competitive 
however  we have an ongoing  extremely focused marketing effort and we have seen an increase in proposal activity  as well as an increase in backlog 
in particular  we are focused on both international expansion as well as significant projects located inside of the united states 

table of contents item business continued on october   we announced that our board of directors had initiated a process to explore and consider possible strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value and supporting the company long term financial strength 
the board of directors retained simmons co 
simmons as its financial advisor during this process 
we continue to take actions to streamline our operations  including the divestiture of our field solutions segment  the implementation of expense reduction initiatives  and the retention of a management consultant to perform advisory services 
we have not made any decision to engage in any specific strategic alternative at this time  and the exploration of strategic alternatives may not result in any specific action or transaction 
englobal does not intend to provide updates or make any further comment regarding its exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives unless and until the board of directors has approved a definitive course of action

in addition to internal growth  historically  our segments have grown through strategic acquisitions  which also served to augment management expertise 
percentage of revenues segments engineering and construction automation engineering and construction segment selected financial data for this segment is summarized as follows dollars in thousands revenue operating profit loss total assets 
table of contents item business continued general the engineering and construction segment provides services relating to the development  management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project services primarily to the midstream and downstream sectors throughout the united states 
our engineering and construction segment offers feasibility studies  engineering  design  procurement and construction management 
the engineering and construction segment includes the government services group  which provides engineering  design  installation and operation and maintenance of various government  public sector and international facilities 
the engineering and construction segment offers a wide range of services as a single source provider 
englobal engineering staff has the capability of developing a project from the initial planning stages through detailed design and construction management 
our services include conceptual studies  project definition  cost estimating  engineering design  environmental compliance  material procurement  project and construction management  and facility inspection 
the engineering and construction segment currently operates through englobal wholly owned subsidiaries  englobal us  inc englobal us and englobal government services  inc englobal us  focuses on providing its services to the midstream and downstream segments of the oil and gas industry  chemical and petrochemical manufacturers  utilities and alternative energy developers 
it also provides its services via in plant personnel assigned to client locations throughout the united states 
englobal us  inc also focuses on energy infrastructure projects in the united states by offering personnel and services primarily in the areas of construction  construction management  process plant turnaround management  plant asset management  commissioning and start up 
the engineering and construction segment has existing blanket service contracts under which it provides clients either with services on a time and material basis or with services on a fixed price basis 
the company strives to establish longer term alliance or preferred provider relationships with its clients that can be expected to provide a steadier stream of work 
in addition  this segment provides outsourced personnel to englobal clients  a service that contributes to a more stable business mix for the company 
our engineering and construction segment operates out of offices in baton rouge and lake charles  louisiana  beaumont  houston  deer park and freeport  texas  tulsa  oklahoma  chicago  illinois  and denver  colorado 
englobal government services  inc primarily provides automated fuel handling systems and maintenance services to branches of the us military and public sector entities 
other clients of this division are government agencies  refineries  petrochemical and process industry customers worldwide 
government services provides electrical and instrument installation  technical services  on going maintenance and calibration and repair services 
as a service based business  the engineering and construction segment is more labor than capital intensive 
this segment s results primarily depend on our ability to generate revenue and collect cash in excess of any cost for employees and benefits  material  equipment and subcontracts  plus our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
the engineering and construction segment derives revenue primarily from time and material fees charged for professional and technical services  but its net income is derived primarily from services it provides to the oil and gas industry  utilities and alternative energy developers 
the segment also enters into contracts providing for the execution of projects on a fixed price basis  whereby some  or all  of the project activities related to engineering  material procurement and construction epc are performed for a fixed price amount 

table of contents item business continued as a result of dramatic decreases in prices for energy commodities  lower profit spreads for downstream operators and a more difficult financing environment  we experienced a dramatic decrease in spending by the majority of our clients during this reduction was most evident in the domestic refining and petrochemical industries  so that much of our work in this area consisted of maintenance  small capital retrofit and safety  regulatory and compliance driven work 
competition also increased greatly for the limited amount of project work 
as a result of stabilization of the economy in  we experienced a stabilization of our revenues with projects consisting mainly of maintenance work in both and operating profits decreased million in  primarily due to a million goodwill impairment 
competition our engineering and construction segment competes with a large number of public and private firms of various sizes  ranging from the industry largest firms  which operate on a worldwide basis  to much smaller regional and local firms 
many of our competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them than we do 
however  the largest firms in our industry are sometimes our clients  as they perform as program managers for very large scale projects and then subcontract a portion of their work to englobal 
we also have many competitors who are smaller than us and who  as a result  may be able to offer services at more competitive prices 
competition is centered on performance and the ability to provide the engineering  planning and project delivery skills required for completing projects in a timely  cost efficient manner 
the expertise of our management and technical personnel and the timeliness and quality of our support services are key competitive factors 
automation segment selected financial data for this segment is summarized as follows dollars in thousands revenue operating profit total assets general the automation segment provides services related to the design  fabrication and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems  advanced automation  information technology and heat tracing projects primarily to the upstream and downstream sectors throughout the united states as well as specific projects in the middle east and central asia 
this segment also designs  assembles  integrates and services control and instrumentation systems for specific applications in the energy and processing related industries 
these services are offered to clients in the petroleum refining  petrochemical  pipeline  production  process and pulp and paper industries throughout the united states and canada as well as the middle east and the caribbean 
the automation segment operates through englobal wholly owned subsidiary  englobal us  inc and derives revenue from both time and material fees and fees charged for professional and technical services on a fixed price basis 
as a service provider  our automation segment is more labor than capital intensive 
the segment results primarily depend on our ability to accurately estimate costs on fixed price contracts  generate revenue and collect amounts due under time and material contracts in excess of the cost of employees and benefits  material  equipment  subcontracts  and applicable sg a expenses 
our automation segment operates out of offices in baton rouge  louisiana  beaumont and houston  texas  and mobile  alabama 
as a result of dramatic decreases in prices for energy commodities  lower profit spreads for downstream operators  the upstream sector and a more difficult financing environment  we experienced a dramatic decrease in spending by the majority of our clients during this reduction was most evident in the domestic refining and petrochemical industries and decreased exploration and production industries  so that much of our work in this area consisted of smaller projects

the technical expertise of our management team and technical personnel and the timeliness and quality of our support services are key competitive factors 
discontinued operations during and early  we divested the field solutions segment 
this segment had been declining in net revenue contribution over the last four years 
selected financial data for this segment is summarized as follows dollars in thousands revenue operating profit total assets general our field solutions segment provided inspection  land management  right of way  environmental compliance  legislative affairs support and governmental regulatory compliance services primarily to the midstream sector  including pipeline  utility and telecommunications companies and other owner operators of infrastructure facilities throughout the united states 
the need to transport new sources of energy was the primary driver that resulted in demand for our rights of way and inspection services  including pipelines and electric power transmission lines  as well as their related facilities 
for example  rights of way are required for pipelines that transport oil and gas from imported sources and from newly developed oil reserve basins in the us rights of way are also required for new electric power transmission lines needed to decongest circuits near population centers and to transport a growing amount of wind and solar power located in remote areas 
in most cases  these rights of ways are acquired prior to the construction phase of the project 
once the construction phase of the project commenced  englobal provided qualified certified inspectors through our inspection division 
included within the scope of our inspection services was construction management  welding inspection  coating and lining inspection  valves and assembly  pressure vessels  mechanical and associated plant and field process equipment oversight  structural fabrication  field fabrication  shop fabricated skid packages  turnkey responsibility for third party interpretations  process safety management data  ultrasonic thickness and flaw detection  magnetic particle examination  liquid penetrate examination  hydrostatic testing and pigging  holiday testing and vacuum testing 
the field solutions segment derived revenue from time and material fees charged for professional and technical services and  as a service company  was more labor than capital intensive 
results for the field solutions segment primarily depended on its ability to generate revenue and collect cash under time and material contracts in excess of costs for employees and benefits  material  equipment  subcontracts  and sg a expenses 

table of contents item business continued competition the field solutions segment competed with a range of small and mid size firms that provide right of way mapping  title assistance  appraisals  landowner negotiations and inspection services 
competition was centered on retaining experienced inspectors  landsmen and other qualified professionals 
inspection personnel must have knowledge of integrity services to serve oil and gas pipelines and related facilities 
in addition  inspection specialists must have a thorough understanding of governmental and public regulatory factors  as well as a firm grasp on health and safety issues that are involved in any construction environment 
inspectors must hold certifications for welding  field fabrication and shop fabricated packages  pressure vessels  valves and assemblies and structural fabrication 
land and right of way specialists must have a thorough understanding of governmental and public regulatory requirements 
these professionals must consider socioeconomic and environmental factors and coordinate planning for the relocation of utilities  displaced persons and businesses 
also  they must often assist in developing replacement housing units  which may involve the expenditure of large sums  condemnation  damages  restriction of access and similar complicating factors 
retaining these qualified  skilled professionals was crucial to the operation of our field solutions segment 
acquisitions and divestitures in the past  we have expanded our business through both internal initiatives and through strategic acquisitions 
these acquisitions allowed us to i expand our client base and the range of services that we provide to our clients  ii add new technical capabilities that can be marketed to our existing client base  iii grow our business geographically  and iv capture more of each project value 
in  we did not target acquisitions as we believed the time and expense required would take away from the successful execution of our company strategy 
in and early  because of the significant decline in our operations  we divested our less profitable businesses  including the electrical services group and field solutions segment 
as of the date of this report  we believe we have stabilized operations and do not expect any further divestitures in seasonality our revenues are generated by services  and therefore holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for services and capital expenditures during the year 
our clients annual budget process is normally completed in the first quarter  which can slow the award of new work at the beginning of the year 
principally due to these factors  our first and fourth quarters are typically less robust than our second and third quarters 
business strategy our primary objective continues to be strengthening our position as a leading full service provider of project delivery services to the energy industry by enhancing our overall range of capabilities in the areas of engineering and construction and automation services 
because of the significant decline in our operations during  we have been focused on downsizing our operations  maintaining our core business strengths and repairing our financing relationships with our lenders 
specifically  we have executed and are focused on the following downsizing the divestiture of our field solutions segment resulted in the reduction of approximately personnel 
in addition  we have closed two offices and undertaken a review of our continuing operations 
currently  we are in process of streamlining our back office support  reducing the cost of outside consultants and limiting general and administrative expenditures 
business strengths we are implementing the recommendations of our consultants and focusing our efforts on our core business segments  engineering and construction e c and automation 
going forward  we expect to continue our relationships with our repeat clients and forge new relationships within our core expertise and experience 
financial relationships we are attempting to repair our banking relationship with the lenders under the pnc credit facility by seeking to obtain the cure or waiver of existing defaults on our debt covenants and maintaining compliance with all terms of the pnc credit facility in the future 
in addition  we are attempting to accomplish the same objectives with our ex im credit facility so we can operate our business in the future on similar terms as our competitors

table of contents item business continued sales and marketing englobal derives revenue primarily from three sources business development  preferred provider alliance agreements with strategic clients  and referrals from existing customers and industry members 
our senior vice president of business development supervises our in house business development assigned to clients and territories within the united states 
client relationships are nurtured by our geographic advantage of having office locations near our larger customers 
by having clients in close proximity  we are able to provide single  dedicated points of contact 
our growth depends in large measure on our ability to attract and retain qualified business development managers and business development personnel with a respected reputation in the energy industry 
management believes that in house marketing allows for more accountability and control  thus increasing profitability 
our business development focuses on building long term relationships with customers and clients in order to provide solutions throughout the life cycle of their facilities 
additionally  we seek to capitalize on cross selling opportunities between our engineering and construction and automation segments 
sales leads are often jointly developed and pursued by the business development personnel from these segments 
products and services are also promoted through trade advertising  participation in industry conferences and on line internet communication via our corporate home page at www 
englobal 
com 
the englobal website provides information about our operating segments and illustrates our company full range of services and capabilities 
we use internal and external resources to maintain and update our website on an ongoing basis 
through the englobal website  we seek to provide visitors and investors with a single point of contact for obtaining information about englobal services 
englobal develops preferred provider and alliance agreements with clients in order to facilitate repeat business 
these preferred provider agreements  also known as master services agreements or umbrella agreements  are typically two to three years in length 
although the agreement is not a guarantee for work under a certain project  englobal generally offers a slightly reduced billing structure to clients willing to commit to arrangements that are expected to provide a steady stream of work 
with the terms of the contract settled  add on projects with these customers are easier to negotiate and can be accepted quickly  without the necessity of a bidding process 
management believes that these agreements can serve to stabilize project centered operations in the engineering and construction segment 
much of our business is repeat business and we are introduced to new customers in many cases by referrals from existing customers and industry members 
management believes referral marketing provides the opportunity for increased profitability because referrals do not involve direct selling 
rather  they allow satisfied customers to sell our services and products on our behalf 
englobal strives to develop our clients trust  and then benefits by word of mouth referrals 
our past acquisition program has provided the benefit of expanding our existing customer base and range of services 
management believes that cross selling among our businesses is an effective way to build client loyalty by solidifying the client relationship  thereby reducing attrition and increasing the lifetime profitability of each project 
the company also believes that cross selling can help ensure more predictable revenue and can be a cost effective way to grow our business as customers are able to realize efficiencies as well as leverage results from using a single supplier for multiple products and services 
customers our customer base consists primarily of fortune companies in the energy industry 
while we do not have continuing dependence on any single client or a limited group of clients  one or a few clients may contribute a substantial portion of our revenue in any given year or over a period of several consecutive years due to the longevity of major projects  such as facility upgrades or expansions 
englobal may work for many different subsidiaries or divisions of our clients  which involves multiple parties to material contracts 
the loss of a single contract award would not likely have a material impact on our financial results but the loss of a single large customer  including all of its subsidiaries or divisions  or the reduction in demand for our services by several customers in the same year would likely have such an effect 
the company continues to focus substantial attention on improving customer services in order to enhance satisfaction and increase customer retention 
revenue generated through sources such as in plant staffing and preferred provider relationships are longer term in nature and are not typically limited to one project 
for example  our engineering and construction segment provides outsourced technical and other personnel that are assigned to work at client locations 
in the past  these assignments often span multiple projects and multiple years  and although these engagements involve a lower margin  they help contribute to a steady stream of work 

table of contents item business continued a major long term trend among our clients and their industry counterparts has been outsourcing engineering services 
this trend has fostered the development of ongoing  longer term client arrangements  rather than one time limited engagements 
these arrangements vary in scope  duration and degree of commitment 
while there is typically no guarantee that work will result from these agreements  often the arrangements form the basis for a longer term client relationship 
despite their variety  we believe that these partnering relationships have a stabilizing influence on our revenue 
these engagements may provide for any of the following a minimum number of work man hours over a specified period  the provision of at least a designated percentage of the client requirements  the designation of the company as the client sole or preferred source of services at specific locations or on specific projects  or a non binding preference or intent  or a general contractual framework  for what the parties expect will be an ongoing relationship 
overall  our ten largest customers  who vary from one period to the next  accounted for of our total revenues for and of our total revenues for most of our projects are specific in nature and we generally have multiple projects with the same clients 
if we were to lose one or more of our significant clients and were unable to replace them with other customers or other projects  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our top three clients in were the caspian pipeline consortium  the us government and basf corporation 
even though we frequently receive work from repeat clients  our client list may vary significantly from year to year 
our potential revenue in all segments is dependent on continuing relationships with our customers 
engineering and construction segment in the engineering and construction segment  our ten largest customers vary from one year to the next 
this segment top three clients in were basf corporation  chevron and conoco phillips 
these customers accounted for of our total segment revenues for and of total revenue for although the engineering and construction segment frequently receives work from repeat clients  its client list may vary significantly from year to year 
in order to generate revenue in future years  we must continue efforts to obtain new engineering and construction management projects 
the in plant division within the engineering and construction segment generates the majority of its revenue through in plant staffing and construction related staffing at field locations 
we consider all of these longer term in nature and not typically limited to one project 
automation segment in the automation segment  our ten largest customers vary from one year to the next 
this segment top three clients in were the caspian pipeline consortium  mississippi power company and norco refinery 
these customers accounted for of our total segment revenues for  and of total revenues for foreign customers accounted for of our automation segment revenues for and of automation segment revenues for although the automation segment frequently receives work from repeat clients  its client list may vary significantly from year to year 
the automation segment clients are primarily in the midstream and downstream process industries  and their needs result primarily from requirements to upgrade obsolete distributed control systems or process analytical equipment 
until  we provided industrial electrical maintenance services  expert supervision and craft labor to our clients in downstream power generation facilities 
this division was classified as a discontinued operation in september contracts we generally enter into two principal types of contracts with our clients time and material contracts and fixed price contracts 
our mix of net revenue between time and material and fixed price contracts is shown in the table below 
our clients typically determine the type of contract to be utilized for a particular engagement  with the specific terms and conditions of a contract resulting from a negotiation process between the company and our client 
time and material fixed price revenue revenue dollars in thousands engineering and construction automation total 
table of contents item business continued time and material under our time and material contracts  we are paid for labor at either negotiated hourly billing rates  a multiple of our actual labor rate or through reimbursement for allowable hourly rates and other expenses 
we are paid for material and contracted services at an agreed upon multiplier of our cost  and at times we pass non labor costs for equipment  materials and subcontractor services through with no profit 
profitability on these contracts is driven by billable headcount  the amount of non labor related services and cost control 
many of these contracts have upper limits  referred to as not to exceed amounts 
generally  our scope is not defined under a not to exceed agreement  and we are not under any obligation to provide services beyond the limits of the contract  but if we generate costs and billings that exceed the upper limits of the contract ceiling or are not allowable  we may be unable to obtain reimbursement for the excess cost 
further  the continuation of each contract partially depends upon the customer discretionary periodic assessment of our performance on that contract 
fixed price under a fixed price contract  we provide the customer a total project for an agreed upon price  subject to project circumstances and changes in scope 
fixed price projects vary in size and may include engineering activities and related services  responsibility for the procurement of materials and equipment  and oversight of the construction through a subcontractor 
fixed price contracts carry certain inherent risks  including risks of losses from underestimating costs  delays in project completion  problems with new technologies  the impact of the economy on labor shortages  increases in equipment and materials costs  natural disasters  and other events and changes that may occur over the contract period 
another risk is our ability or inability to secure written change orders prior to commencing work on contract changes in scope  without which we may not receive payment for work performed 
consequently  the profitability of fixed price contracts may vary substantially 
backlog continuing operations backlog represents an estimate of gross revenues of all awarded contracts that have not been completed and will be recognized as revenue over the life of the project 
although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
further  most contracts with clients may be terminated by either party at will  in which case the client would only be obligated to us for services provided through the termination date 
as a result  no assurances can be given that the amounts included in backlog will ultimately be realized 
in addition  it is not clear how our backlog will be impacted by current or future economic conditions 
at december   our backlog was approximately million compared to an estimated million at december  we expect the majority of our backlog to be completed during the backlog at december  consisted of million with commercial customers and million with the united states government 
backlog on federal programs includes only the portion of the contract award that has been funded 
the backlog for each of our segments at december  was as follows engineering and construction million automation million backlog includes gross revenue under two types of contracts contracts for which work authorizations have been received on a fixed price basis or time and material projects that are well defined  and time and material evergreen contracts at an assumed month run rate  under which we place employees at our clients site to perform day to day project efforts 
there is no assurance as to the percentage of backlog that will be recognized under these contracts 
customer service and support we provide service and technical support to our customers in varying degrees depending upon the business line and on customer contractual arrangements 
the company technical staff provides initial telephone support services for its customers 
these services include isolating and verifying reported failures and authorizing repair services in support of customer requirements 
we also provide on site engineering support if a technical issue cannot be resolved over the telephone 
on projects for which we have provided engineered systems  we provide on site factory acceptance tests and worldwide start up and commissioning services 
we also pass through the manufacturers limited warranty coverage for products we re sell 
the company seeks to provide experienced customer service representatives in order to achieve increased client satisfaction and loyalty 
dependence on suppliers our ability to provide clients with services and systems in a timely and competitive manner depends on the availability of products and parts from our suppliers at competitive prices and on reasonable terms 
our suppliers are not obligated to have products on hand for timely delivery nor can they guarantee product availability in sufficient quantities to meet our demands 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary supplies at prices or on terms we find acceptable 
however  in an effort to maximize availability and maintain quality control  we generally procure components from multiple distributors on our clients behalf and in some cases we can take advantage of national agreements our clients may have entered into 

table of contents item business continued for example  all of the product components used by our automation segment are fabricated using components and materials that are available from numerous domestic manufacturers and suppliers 
there are approximately five principal suppliers of distributed control systems  each of which can be replaced by an equally viable competitor  and our clients typically direct the selection of their preferred supplier 
no one manufacturer or vendor provides products that account for more than of our revenue 
thus  in the vast majority of cases  we anticipate little or no difficulty in obtaining components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner to support our manufacturing and assembly operations in the automation segment 
units produced through the automation segment are normally not produced for inventory and component parts  rather  they are typically purchased on an as needed basis 
by being vendor neutral  englobal is able to provide quality technology and platforms for the design of plant systems such as d modeling  process simulation and other technical applications 
despite the foregoing  our automation segment relies on certain suppliers for necessary components and there can be no assurance that these components will continue to be available on acceptable terms 
if a vendor does not continue to contract with us  it may be difficult to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in our ability to provide products and services to our customers 
while we do not believe that such a disruption is likely  if it did occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
patents  trademarks  licenses our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology  which we do primarily through protection of our trade secrets and confidentiality agreements 
in addition  the us patent and trademark office registered our integrated rack tm patent application in our trade names are protected by registration as well as by common law trademark rights 
our trademark for the use of englobal in connection with our products is registered with the us patent and trademark office and we claim common law trademark rights for englobal tm in connection with our services 
we also have pending trademark applications for engineered for growth and we claim common law trademark rights for global thinking global solutions tm  cares communicating appropriate responses in emergency situations tm  flare mon tm  purchased data tm  vimac tm  englobal vu tm  rifat tm  and englobal power islands tm 
there can be no assurance that the protective measures we currently employ will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of our technology  or the independent third party development of the same or similar technology 
although our competitive position to some extent depends on our ability to protect our proprietary and trade secret information  we believe that other factors  such as the technical expertise and knowledge base of our management and technical personnel  as well as the timeliness and quality of the support services we provide  will also help us to maintain our competitive position 
employees as of december   the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately  individuals on a full time equivalent basis 
we believe that our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled and experienced technical  sales and management personnel has been and will continue to be critical to our ability to execute our business plan 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that relations with our employees are good 
government regulations englobal and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various foreign  federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to our business and operations  and various health and safety regulations established by the occupational safety and health administration osha 
the company and our professional staff are subject to a variety of state  local and foreign licensing  registration and other regulatory requirements governing the practice of engineering and other professional disciplines 
for example  osha requires process safety management to prevent the release of hazardous chemicals  the department of transportation dot requires that pipeline operators are in full compliance with pipeline safety regulations  and the environmental and protection agency epa provides incentives to reduce chemical emissions 
currently  we are not aware of any situation or condition relating to the regulation of the company  its subsidiaries  or personnel that we believe is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and that upon the occurrence of any of these events  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our business  industry and strategy significant losses and defaults under our credit facilities raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  the company has suffered losses from operations and is in default under its credit facilities 
these issues raise substantial doubt about the company ability to continue as a going concern

risk factors continued if we are unable to regain compliance with the nasdaq minimum bid requirement for continued listing  the value and liquidity of our common stock may decline significantly 
on october   we received notification from the nasdaq stock market that we were not in compliance with nasdaq s continued listing rule a because the closing bid price for a share of our common stock was below for consecutive trading days 
on april   nasdaq approved our application to transfer our stock listing from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market  effective with the opening of trading on april  in connection with our transfer to the nasdaq capital market  we have been afforded days  or until september   to regain compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement for continued listing  including curing the deficiency by effecting a reverse stock split  if necessary 
in order to regain compliance by september   the closing bid price for a share of our common stock must be at least for ten consecutive trading days 
if we are unable to regain compliance prior to september  or do not comply with the terms of the day extension  our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq capital market  subject to our right to appeal the delisting to a hearings panel 
the delisting of our common stock from trading on nasdaq may have a material adverse effect on the market for  and liquidity and price of  our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital 
delisting from nasdaq could also have other negative results  including  without limitation  the potential loss of confidence by customers and employees  the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities 
if our common stock is delisted from trading on nasdaq  trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over the counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the otc markets or otc bulletin board 
in such event  it could become more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations for the price of our common stock  and there may also be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline further 
failure to obtain an extension of the forbearance periods under the pnc credit facility and ex im bank facility or to otherwise obtain the cure or waiver of the defaults thereunder  could result in all indebtedness outstanding under the pnc credit facility and ex im bank facility becoming immediately due and payable 
if that should occur  we may not be able to pay all such amounts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
even if new financing were then available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could accelerate the maturity of the debt or proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such defaulted debt 
in such an event  our business would be materially and adversely affected and we may be forced to sharply curtail or cease operations 
our indebtedness will limit our ability to finance future operations or engage in other business activities and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
as of december   the aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness was approximately million  all of which related to borrowings outstanding under the pnc credit facility  which could have important consequences 
historically  we have relied on credit facilities  including the pnc credit facility and the ex im bank facility  to provide us with adequate working capital to operate our business 
as described above  effective march   the maximum revolving amount as defined in the pnc credit facility was reduced from million to million 
as of march   the balance outstanding on the pnc credit facility was million 
this reduction in availability under the pnc credit facility will limit our ability to expand or engage in other business activities  and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
our future revenue depends on our ability to consistently bid and win new contracts  provide high quality  cost effective services  and to maintain and renew existing contracts 
our failure to effectively obtain future contracts could adversely affect our profitability 
our future revenue and overall results of operations require us to successfully bid on new contracts  provide high quality  cost effective services  and renew existing contracts 
contract proposals and negotiations are complex and frequently involve a lengthy bidding and selection process  which is affected by a number of factors  such as market conditions  financing arrangements and required governmental approvals 
for example  a client may require us to provide a bond or letter of credit to protect the client should we fail to perform under the terms of the contract 
when negative market conditions arise  or if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or required governmental approvals  we may not be able to pursue particular projects  which could adversely affect our profitability 
these factors have impacted our operations in the past several years and may continue to do so 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued the failure to attract and retain key professional personnel would materially adversely affect our business 
our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel even in an environment where the contracting process is more difficult 
we are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial  technical and business development personnel 
in particular  competition for key management personnel continues to be intense 
we cannot be certain that we will retain our key managerial  technical and business development personnel or be able to attract or assimilate key personnel in the future 
failure to attract and retain such personnel would materially adversely affect our businesses  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect us 
one or a few clients have in the past and may in the future contribute a significant portion of our consolidated revenue in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years 
in  our top three clients  the caspian pipeline consortium  the us government and basf corporation  accounted for approximately  and of our revenue  respectively 
as our backlog frequently reflects multiple projects for individual clients  one major customer may comprise a significant percentage of our backlog at any point in time 
because these significant customers generally contract with us for specific projects  we may lose them in other years as their projects with us are completed 
if we do not continually replace them with other customers or other projects  our business could be materially adversely affected 
also  the majority of our contracts can be terminated at will 
although we have long standing relationships with many of our significant customers  our contracts with these customers are on a project by project basis and the customers may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time 
in addition  dissatisfaction with the results of a single project could have a much more widespread impact on our ability to get additional projects from a single major client 
the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future revenue or earnings 
as of december   our backlog was approximately million 
we cannot assure investors that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
projects currently in our backlog may be canceled or may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time prior to project execution and  once project execution begins  it may occur unevenly over the current and multiple future periods 
in addition  project terminations  suspensions or reductions in scope occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog  reducing the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog 
future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn 
these adjustments are exacerbated by current economic conditions 
our dependence on subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect us 
we rely on third party subcontractors as well as third party suppliers and manufacturers to complete our projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire supplies or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion may be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed price or time and material contracts  we could experience losses on these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or supplier is unable to deliver its services or materials according to the negotiated contract terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition or over commitment of its resources  we may be required to purchase the services or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services or materials were needed 
if we are unable to collect our receivables  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed and materials supplied 
we bear the risk that our clients will pay us late or not at all 
though we evaluate and attempt to monitor our clients financial condition  there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess their creditworthiness 
even if they are credit worthy  they may delay payments in an effort to manage their cash flow 
financial difficulties or business failure experienced by one or more of our major customers has had and could  in the future  continue to have a material adverse effect on both our ability to collect receivables and our results of operations 
liability claims could result in losses 
providing engineering and design services involves the risk of contract  professional errors and omissions and other liability claims  as well as adverse publicity 
further  many of our contracts require us to indemnify our clients not only for our negligence  if any  but also for the concurrent negligence of our clients 
we currently maintain liability insurance coverage  including coverage for professional errors and omissions 
however  claims outside of or exceeding our insurance coverage may be made 
a significant claim could result in unexpected liabilities  take management time away from operations  and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued we may incur significant costs in providing services in excess of original project scope without having an approved change order 
after commencement of a contract  we may perform  without the benefit of an approved change order from the customer  additional services requested by the customer that were not contemplated in our contract price due to customer changes or to incomplete or inaccurate engineering  project specifications  and other similar information provided to us by the customer 
our construction contracts generally require the customer to compensate us for additional work or expenses incurred under these circumstances as long as we obtain prior written approval 
a failure to obtain adequate written approvals prior to performing the work could require us to record an adjustment to revenue and profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage of completion accounting method 
any such adjustments  if substantial  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly for the period in which such adjustments are made 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining  through negotiation  arbitration  litigation or otherwise  approved change orders in an amount sufficient to compensate us for our additional  unapproved work or expenses 
failure to maintain adequate internal controls could adversely affect us 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
our internal controls over financial reporting may not be adequate and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their adequacy 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
if we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting  our business and our stock price could be adversely affected 
we have  in the past  identified material weaknesses in our internal controls  and while these have been cured  if we determine that we have further material weaknesses  it could affect our ability to ensure timely and reliable financial reports 
our business and operating results could be adversely affected by our inability to accurately estimate the overall risks  revenue or costs on a contract 
revenue recognition for a contract requires judgment relative to assessing the contracts estimated risks  revenue and costs and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of overall risk  revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
changes in underlying assumptions  circumstances or estimates have in the past and may continue to adversely affect future period financial performance 
force majeure events such as natural disasters could negatively impact the economy and the industries we service  which may negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
force majeure events  such as hurricanes  could negatively impact the economies of the areas in which we operate 
for example  during  hurricanes gustav and ike caused considerable damage along the gulf coast not only to the refining and petrochemical industry  but also the commercial segment which competes for labor  materials and equipment resources needed throughout the entire united states 
in some cases  we remain obligated to perform our services after a natural disaster even though our contracts may contain force majeure clauses 
in those cases  if we are not able to react quickly and or negotiate contractual relief on favorable terms to the company  our operations may be significantly and adversely affected  which would have a negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unsatisfactory safety performance can affect customer relationships  result in higher operating costs and result in high employee turnover 
our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing services on construction sites and industrial facilities 
even with proper safety precautions  these hazards can lead to personal injury  loss of life  damage to  or destruction of property  plant and equipment  and environmental damages 
we are intensely focused on maintaining a safe environment and reducing the risk of accidents across all of our job sites 
however  poor safety performance may limit or eliminate potential revenue streams from many of our largest customers and may materially increase our future insurance and other operating costs 
in hiring new employees  we normally target experienced personnel  however  we also hire inexperienced employees 
even with thorough safety training  inexperienced employees have a higher likelihood of injury which could lead to higher operating costs and insurance rates

in order to regain compliance by september   the closing bid price for a share of our common stock must be at least for ten consecutive trading days 
if we are unable to regain compliance prior to september  or do not comply with the terms of the day extension  our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq capital market  subject to our right to appeal the delisting to a hearings panel 
the delisting of our common stock from trading on nasdaq may have a material adverse effect on the market for  and liquidity and price of  our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital 
delisting from nasdaq could also have other negative results  including  without limitation  the potential loss of confidence by customers and employees  the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities

our board of directors may authorize future sales of englobal common stock  which could result in a decrease in the market value to existing stockholders of the shares they hold 
our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to an additional  shares of common stock and an additional  shares of blank check preferred stock as of the date of filing 
these shares may be issued without stockholder approval unless the issuance is or more of our outstanding common stock  in which case the nasdaq requires stockholder approval 
we may issue shares of stock in the future in connection with acquisitions or financings 
in addition  we may issue restricted stock or options under our equity incentive plan 
future issuances of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that these sales could occur  may affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the ability of the board of directors to issue additional stock may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control of the company  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock 
our stock price could be volatile  which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in particular  the market price of our common stock  like that of the securities of other energy companies  has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
during  the sales price of our stock ranged from a low of per share on october  to a high of per share on april  
factors such as announcements concerning our financial and operating results  the availability of capital  and economic and other external factors  as well as period to period fluctuations and financial results  may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
from time to time  there has been limited trading volume in our common stock 
in addition  there can be no assurance that there will continue to be a trading market or that any securities research analysts will continue to provide research coverage with respect to our common stock 
it is possible that such factors will adversely affect the market for our common stock 
a small number of stockholders own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock  thus limiting the extent to which other stockholders can effect decisions subject to stockholder vote 
directors  executive officers and principal stockholders of englobal and their affiliates  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis

these factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in management or voting control of the company 
future issuances of our securities in connection with financing transactions or under equity incentive plans could dilute current stockholders ownership

we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future issuances of debt  our common stock  other equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or other equity securities or the availability of any of the foregoing for future sale  will have on the market price of our common stock 
the issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or the conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding now or in the future  or the perception that such issuances could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the substantial losses we incurred in and the resulting defaults under our credit facilities raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
while englobal experienced a difficult and continues to face a number of challenges  we are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for because of the losses in and  we have divested our least attractive businesses and are now focused on our core business segments  engineering and construction and automation 
in this regard  we have reduced our expenses by reducing employee headcount  closing offices and creating an enhanced operational focus on cost controls 
in addition  we are seeing an increase in capital project spending in limited markets in although we are in default under the pnc credit facility and the ex im bank facility  we continue to discuss with our lenders the terms under which the defaults may be cured or waived 
despite the relative increase in capital project spending in certain limited markets  we believe that overall  client spending continues to be limited  which we believe may be due to the uncertainty experienced by businesses regarding the political climate in washington dc and the sluggish improvement in the economy overall 
in addition  pricing continues to be very competitive 
however  we have an ongoing  extremely focused marketing effort and we have seen an increase in proposal activity  as well as an increase in backlog 
in particular  we are focused on both international expansion as well as significant projects located inside of the united states 
on october   we announced that our board of directors had initiated a process to explore and consider possible strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value and supporting the company long term financial strength 
the board of directors retained simmons co 
simmons as its financial advisor during this process 
we continue to take actions to streamline our operations  including the divestiture of our field solutions segment  the implementation of expense reduction initiatives  and the retention of a management consultant to perform advisory services 
we have not made any decision to engage in any specific strategic alternative at this time  and the exploration of strategic alternatives may not result in any specific action or transaction 
englobal does not intend to provide updates or make any further comment regarding its exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives unless and until the board of directors has approved a definitive course of action 
amounts reported as continuing operations in and are reported for the two segments that we continue to operate engineering and construction and automation 
results reported as discontinued operations electrical services and field solutions are the result of management s decision to divest from these operations 
results of continuing operations the company revenue from continuing operations is composed of engineering  procurement and construction management epcm services revenue and the sale of fabricated engineered automation systems 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as the services are performed 
the majority of the company engineering services have historically been provided through time and material contracts whereas a majority of the company engineered automation system sales are earned on fixed price contracts 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide materials and equipment and may provide construction or construction management services on a subcontractor basis 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed  along with handling fees  which in total are at margins lower than those of our normal core business 
in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  all such costs and fees are included in revenue 
the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  therefore  changes in revenue and gross profit  sg a expense and operating income as a percent of revenue may not be indicative of the company core business trends 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating sg a expense includes management  business development and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel  bad debt and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment operations

overall revenue decreased in as a result of less project work from new clients 
in addition  revenues were impacted by existing projects that were either finished or experienced significantly diminished activity during the month period 
our clients are continuing to perform smaller maintenance projects but not new capital expansions 
competition for the project work continues to be intense 
gross profit the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in relative to was caused by several factors including reduced revenues  higher material costs as a function of current project requirements and higher variable labor costs due to an operational focus on utilization  resulting in higher margins 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the decrease in operating sg a expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the comparable period  is primarily the result of decreases of million in salaries and employee related expenses and decreases of million in professional services  offset by an increase of million due to software upgrades and maintenance expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses increased to for the year ended december   from for the comparable prior year period 
goodwill impairment because of deteriorating market conditions in  our declining financial performance and the decision to sell several of our assets  we performed an interim assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill as of september  we reviewed a number of factors on a segment by segment basis  including market conditions  projected cash flows  cost of capital  growth rates and other factors that could significantly impact the reported value of our goodwill 
as a result of this review  we recorded a goodwill impairment of approximately million as of december  of this amount  approximately million related to continuing operations and approximately million relating to discontinued operations 
operating income loss the increase in operating loss for the year ended december   as compared to the comparable period  was attributable to an impairment of goodwill in the engineering and construction segment of million  lower revenue levels as well as increased costs for both travel expenses and variable labor 
these increased costs also contributed to increased operating loss as a percentage of revenue

discontinued operations during the third quarter of  as part of its strategic evaluation of operations  the company determined that the expected future profitability of the electrical services group was not sufficient to support maintaining it as a viable business and that it did not fit within the future strategic plan due to its operational differences 
as a result  effective july   the company initiated a plan to sell the operations of its electrical services group 
the company was unable to sell the electrical services group as planned and decided to dispose of substantially all of the group s remaining assets 
during the third quarter of  the company completed the disposal of the group s remaining assets concurrent with the completion of the last remaining lump sum project 
the company has no continuing involvement with these operations 
on september   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its field solutions segment 
the field solutions segment includes the land and right of way and inspection divisions  primarily serving pipeline and electric power companies 
on november   the company completed the divestiture of its land and right of way division of its field solutions segment effective october  the transaction was valued at approximately million  consisting of approximately million in retained working capital and a million promissory note payable to the company over four years 
effective january   the company completed the divestiture of the inspection division 
the transaction was valued at approximately million  consisting of million cash at closing  million in retained working capital and a million promissory note payable to the company over four years 
the operations of the electrical services group and the field solutions segment have been classified as discontinued operations and accordingly  are presented as discontinued operations in the company re cast consolidated financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources overview the company defines liquidity as its ability to pay liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations and availability under our credit facilities  including the pnc credit facility and the ex im bank facility 
as a result of the defaults under the pnc credit facility and the ex im bank facility described below  additional borrowings under the pnc credit facility are at the sole discretion of pnc bank 
as of december   we had million in working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities 
as of march   unrestricted cash on hand totaled approximately million 
as of march   one million letter of credit was outstanding under the ex im bank facility and collateralized by million in cash 
as a result  the company ability to pay liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations  currently depends primarily on cash flow from operations and the timely collection of outstanding invoices 
cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if outstanding invoices billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner  circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices  we lose one or more of our major customers  we are unable to win new projects that we can perform on a profitable basis  we are unable to obtain the cure or waiver of the defaults under the pnc credit or ex im bank facilities  or the availability of borrowings under the pnc credit facility is further reduced 
if any such event occurs and continues without remedy  we would be required to consider alternative financing options

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accounts receivable management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the number of days sales outstanding for trade accounts receivable increased from days at december  to days at december  bad debt expense was approximately and of revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million or and of trade accounts receivable balance for each of the years and  respectively 
we continue to manage this portion of our business very carefully 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially face liability for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the sole or concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality our revenues are generated by services  and therefore holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for services and capital expenditures during the year 
our clients annual budget process is normally completed in the first quarter  which can slow the award of new work at the beginning of the year 
principally due to these factors  our first and fourth quarters are typically less robust than our second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition a large portion of the company revenue is recognized under time and material contracts 
significant estimates are generally not involved in determining revenue recognition for these types of contracts 
significant estimates are involved in determining revenue recognition for fixed price contracts 
most of our contracts are with fortune companies 
as a result  collection risk is generally not a relevant factor in the recognition of revenue 
however  timing of accounts receivable collections could have a serious impact in the company liquidity 
we have instituted policies to determine the creditworthiness of new customers 
adverse changes in the economy are likely to impact smaller companies ability to undertake and finance projects 
our revenue is largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts 
some contracts have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
the contract is awarded with the maximum aggregate revenue  referred to as the not to exceed amount 
the company does not earn revenue over the not to exceed amount unless we obtain a change order 
the current amount of revenue deferred for these reasons is million 
the company is not obligated to complete the contract once the not to exceed amount has been reached 
however  if the company performs work over the not to exceed amount prior to obtaining a valid change order  our gross profit margins are negatively impacted 
billings on time and material contracts are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
revenue and cost for these types of purchases are not included in total revenue and cost 
for financial reporting  this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
we had million of pass through transactions in and none in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue on fixed price contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage of completion cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue on long term contracts is recognized in the ratio that contract costs incurred bear to total estimated contract costs 
revenue and gross margin on fixed price contracts are subject to revision throughout the lives of the contracts and any required adjustments are made in the period in which the revisions become known 
to manage unknown risks  management uses contingency amounts to increase the estimated costs  therefore  lowering the earned revenues until the risks are better identified and quantified or have been mitigated 
we currently have million in contingency 
losses on contracts are recorded in full as they are identified 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed price contracts 
the company inability to manage significant levels or increases in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts could have a serious impact on the company cash flow 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on fixed price contracts 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is more likely than not that the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be reliably estimated 
goodwill goodwill has an indefinite useful life 
goodwill is not amortized but  instead  tested at least annually for impairment 
because of deteriorating market conditions  declining financial performance and the decision to sell several of our assets  we made a decision to perform an interim assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill as of september  asc topic requires a two step process  determining the fair value of the reporting units and measuring the amount of the impairment if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
in determining fair value of the reporting segments  we reviewed cash flow projections  the weighted average cost of capital and the sustainable growth rate 
as a result of this review  we concluded the carrying amount exceeded the fair value of our engineering and construction segment and the land and right of way division in our field solutions segment and recorded a goodwill impairment of approximately million as of september  of this amount  approximately million related to continuing operations and approximately million relating to discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter  we divested approximately million in goodwill in the field solutions segment as a result of the closing of the sale of the land and right of way division 
summarized financial information for goodwill is shown below description of segment balance at december  impairments and divestitures balance at december  dollars in thousands engineering and construction automation field solutions discontinued operations total amounts are included in assets held for sale and loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes income taxes the company accounts for deferred income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method  whereby deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of its assets and liabilities 
the provision for income taxes represents the current taxes payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the tax effect of the net change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets when their recovery is doubtful 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company had net deferred tax asset balances of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
these net deferred tax assets are identified in footnote to the financial statements 
asc topic  income taxes requires all available evidence  both positive and negative  be considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
based upon the company recent performance  management determined the realization of deferred tax assets is uncertain as the company is unable to consider tax planning strategies or projections of future taxable income in its evaluation of the realizability of its deferred tax assets as of december  under these circumstances  deferred tax assets may only be realized through future reversals of taxable temporary differences and carryback of net operating losses to available carryback periods 
we have performed such an analysis and a valuation allowance of approximately million has been provided against deferred tax assets as of december  the company had a federal net operating loss carry forward at december  of approximately million which will be available for carryforward through the company also has a foreign net operating loss carry forward at december  of approximately million 
this loss is available for utilization through  however  application of the net operating loss is restricted to the income of englobal canada  ulc 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary market risk relates to its variable rate line of credit debt obligation  which totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
assuming a increase in the interest rate on this variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   to an average interest rate of  annual interest expense would have been approximately  higher in based on our annual average line of credit obligations 
due to the significant losses we incurred during  we have defaulted on certain financial covenants under the pnc credit facility  resulting in an increase of the interest rates in that agreement 
this increase not only resulted in the increased annual interest expense but also additional fees related to the forbearance agreements under the pnc credit facility and the ex im bank facility 
the company does not have any interest rate swap or exchange agreements
