item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview denny s corporation is one of america s largest family style restaurant chains 
our fiscal year ends on the wednesday in december closest to december of each year 
as a result  a fifty third week is added to a fiscal year every five or six years 
 and each included weeks of operations 
our revenues are derived primarily from two sources the sale of food and beverages at our company restaurants and the collection of royalties and fees from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the denny s name 
sales and customer traffic at both company operated and franchised restaurants are affected by the success of our marketing campaigns  new product introductions and customer service  menu pricing  as well as external factors including competition  economic conditions affecting consumer spending and changes in guest tastes and preferences 
sales at company restaurants and royalty income from franchise restaurants are also impacted by the opening of new restaurants  the closing of existing restaurants and the sale of company restaurants to franchisees 
our operating costs are exposed to volatility in two main areas product costs and payroll and benefit costs 
many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility 
this volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable 
in general  we purchase food products based on market prices or we set firm prices in purchase agreements with our vendors 
our ability to lock in prices on certain key commodities is imperative to control food costs in an environment in which many commodity prices are on the rise 
in addition  our continued success with menu management helps us to offer menu items that provide a compelling value to our customers while maintaining consistent product costs and appropriate profitability 
the volatility of payroll and benefit costs results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses  such as medical benefit costs and workers compensation costs 
a number of our employees are paid the minimum wage 
accordingly  substantial increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs 
additionally  changes in guest counts and investments in store level labor impact payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales 
during  we completed fgi  a strategic initiative to increase franchise restaurant development through the sale of certain geographic clusters of company restaurants to both current and new franchisees 
in  as a result of our fgi  we sold restaurant operations to franchisees 
as of december   we have sold company restaurants since our fgi program began in early while we now consider the fgi program to be complete  we may  from time to time  continue to sell restaurants to franchisees where geographically and economically beneficial to the company 
additionally  we have negotiated development agreements for new domestic restaurants  of which have opened 
the majority of the remaining restaurants in the development agreement pipeline are expected to open over the next five years 
while the majority of the restaurants to be opened under these agreements are on schedule  from time to time some of our franchisees ability to grow and meet their development commitments is hampered by the economy and the difficult lending environment 
as a result of the development efforts described above  over the past five years we have transitioned from a restaurant portfolio mix of franchised and company operated to a restaurant portfolio mix of franchised and company operated at december  now that we have achieved our mix target  we expect that our percentage of company operated restaurants will gradually decrease  as the majority of our future unit growth will be through franchised restaurants 
specifically  our focus on fgi has impacted our financial performance as follows company restaurant sales have decreased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the sale of restaurants to franchisees 
the decline in company restaurant revenues is partially offset by increased royalty income derived from the growth in the franchise restaurant base resulting from both traditional development and the conversion of restaurants 
as a result  royalty income  which is included as a component of franchise and license revenue  has increased from million in to million in the resulting net reduction in total revenue related to our fgi is generally recovered by the benefits of a lower cost structure related to franchise and license revenues  a decrease in depreciation and amortization due to the sale of restaurant related assets to franchisees from million in to million in and a reduction in interest expense resulting from the use of proceeds to reduce debt from million in to million in 
see also debt and refinancing and reductions below 
initial franchise fees  included as a component of franchise and license revenue  are generally recognized in the period in which a restaurant is sold to a franchisee or when a new unit is opened 
these initial fees are completely dependent on the number of restaurants sold to or opened by franchisees during a particular period and  as a result  can cause fluctuations in our total franchise and license revenue from year to year 
occupancy revenues  also included as a component of franchise and license revenue  result from leasing or subleasing restaurants to franchisees 
as a result of our fgi  occupancy revenues have increased from million in to million in additionally  when restaurants are sold and leased or subleased to franchisees  the occupancy costs related to these restaurants moves from costs of company restaurant sales to costs of franchise and license revenue to match the related occupancy revenue 
as subleases with franchisees end over time  franchise occupancy revenue and costs could decrease if franchisees enter into direct leases with landlords 
gains on sales of assets are primarily dependent on the number of restaurants sold to franchisees during a particular period  and as a result  can cause fluctuations in net income from year to year 
with the completion of our fgi  gains on sales of assets are expected to decrease 
debt refinancing and reductions interest expense has a significant impact on our net income as a result of our indebtedness 
however  over the past several years  we have continued to reduce interest expense through a series of debt refinancings and repayments using the proceeds generated from our fgi transactions  sales of real estate and cash flow from operations 
these repayments resulted in an overall debt reduction of approximately million during  million in and million in during the second quarter of  we refinanced our credit facility the new credit facility principally to take advantage of lower interest rates available in the senior secured debt market 
borrowings for the new term loan bear a tiered interest rate based on the company consolidated leverage ratio and was initially set at libor plus basis points 
the new credit facility does not contain an interest rate floor for either the term loan or the revolver 
it includes an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the size of the facility to million 
a commitment fee of basis points is paid on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
in accordance with the debt covenants  the reduction in term loan debt resulted in a decrease in the interest rate and the commitment fee 
the interest rate is currently set at libor plus basis points and the commitment fee was reduced to basis points 
for more information  see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facility 
the combination of lower debt balances and lower overall interest rates on our debt should continue to positively benefit our financial performance on an ongoing basis 
share repurchases our credit facility permits the payment of cash dividends and or the purchase of denny s stock subject to certain limitations 
during  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million 
as of december   there are million shares remaining to be repurchased under the current repurchase program

at december   the remaining valuation allowance was approximately million

liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facility as described below and  in recent years  cash proceeds from the sale of restaurant operations to franchisees and sales of surplus properties  to the extent allowed by our credit facility 
principal uses of cash are operating expenses  capital expenditures  debt repayments and  recently  the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
the following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents we believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for  combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility  will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december  these cash flows include million in proceeds from asset sales and collections of notes receivable of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million  acquisition of a restaurant unit of million and issuances of notes receivable of million 
the notes receivable primarily consist of notes from franchisees related to the system wide roll out of new coffee equipment 
of these notes receivable  approximately million are due within the next months 
our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the following fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands facilities new construction remodeling information technology other capital expenditures the decrease in new construction is primarily the result of the conversion of restaurants at pilot flying j travel centers during the prior year 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  including approximately remodels at company restaurants 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   which included net debt reduction of million  stock repurchases of million  deferred financing costs of million and debt transactions costs of million 
our working capital deficit was million at december  compared with million at december  the increase in working capital deficit is primarily related to the timing of payments impacting prepaid and payable balances 
we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash and cash equivalent basis with a low level of accounts receivable  rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories  and accounts payable for food  beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales 
refinancing of credit facility on april   denny corporation and certain of its subsidiaries refinanced our credit facility the old credit facility and entered into a new five year senior secured credit agreement in an aggregate principal of million the new credit facility 
the new credit facility is comprised of a million senior secured term loan and a million senior secured revolver with a million letter of credit sublimit 
a commitment fee of basis points is paid on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
borrowings for the term loan bear a tiered interest rate based on the company consolidated leverage ratio and was initially set at libor plus basis points 
the new credit facility does not contain an interest rate floor for either the term loan or the revolver 
it includes an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the size of the facility to million 
the maturity date for the new credit facility is april  the new credit facility was used to refinance the old credit facility and is available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
the new credit facility is guaranteed by denny corporation and its material subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the assets of denny corporation and its subsidiaries  including the stock of the company subsidiaries 
it includes negative covenants that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type 
the new credit facility also includes certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated fixed charged coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditures 
the term loan under the new credit facility amortizes million annually  payable in quarterly installments  with all remaining amounts due on the maturity date 
we will be required to make certain mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances and will have the option to make certain prepayments under the new credit facility 
the optional prepayments can be applied against future amortization 
the new credit facility includes events of default and related remedies  including acceleration and increased interest rates following an event of default that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type 
on april   we entered into interest rate hedges that cap the libor rate on borrowings for the term loan under the new credit facility during the first two years of the term loan 
the basis point libor cap applies to million of term loan borrowings during the first year and million of term loan borrowings during the second year 
as a result of the debt refinancing  we recorded million of losses on early extinguishment of debt  consisting primarily of million of transaction costs  million from the write off of deferred financing costs and million from the write off of an original issue discount oid related to the old credit facility 
these losses are included as a component of other nonoperating expense in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   under the new credit facility  we had outstanding term loan borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving letter of credit facility of million 
there were no revolving loans outstanding at december  these balances resulted in availability of million under the revolving facility 
the weighted average interest rate under the term loan was as of december  in accordance with the debt covenants  the reduction in term loan debt since the refinancing resulted in a decrease in the interest rate 
the rate is currently set at libor plus basis points and the commitment fee was reduced to basis points 
contractual obligations our future contractual obligations and commitments at december  consisted of the following payments due by period total less than year years years years and thereafter in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations interest obligations a pension and other defined contribution plan obligations b purchase obligations c total a interest obligations represent payments related to our long term debt outstanding at december  for long term debt with variable rates  we have used the rate applicable at december  to project interest over the periods presented in the table above 
the capital lease obligation amounts above are inclusive of interest 
b pension and other defined contribution plan obligations are estimates based on facts and circumstances at december  amounts cannot currently be estimated for more than one year 
c purchase obligations include amounts payable under purchase contracts for food and non food products 
many of these agreements do not obligate us to purchase any specific volumes and include provisions that would allow us to cancel such agreements with appropriate notice 
for agreements with cancellation provisions  amounts included in the table above represent our estimate of purchase obligations during the periods presented if we were to cancel these contracts with appropriate notice 
unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the contractual obligations table as these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
at december   there were no unrecognized tax benefits including potential interest and penalties 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to self insurance liabilities  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring and exit costs  income taxes and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements self insurance liabilities 
we record liabilities for insurance claims during periods in which we have been insured under large deductible programs or have been self insured for our medical and dental claims and workers compensation  general product and automobile insurance liabilities 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence  ranges from million to million per individual claim for workers compensation and for general product and automobile liability 
the liabilities for prior and current estimated incurred losses are discounted to their present value based on expected loss payment patterns determined by independent actuaries using our actual historical payments 
these estimates include assumptions regarding claims frequency and severity as well as changes in our business environment  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact our overall self insurance costs 
total discounted workers compensation and general liability insurance liabilities at december  and december  were million reflecting a discount rate and million reflecting a discount rate  respectively 
the related undiscounted amounts at such dates were million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the restaurant level on a quarterly basis  when assets are identified as held for sale or whenever changes or events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment of restaurant level assets based on the operating cash flows of the restaurant  expected proceeds from the sale of assets and our plans for restaurant closings 
generally  all restaurants with negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months at each quarter end are included in our assessment 
in performing our assessment  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from similar asset sales  and other factors to determine both the recoverability and the estimated fair value of the respective assets 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant are not recoverable based upon estimated future  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million  and million  respectively  for underperforming restaurants  including restaurants closed and company restaurants classified as held for sale 
these charges are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in our consolidated statements of income 
at december   we had a total of two restaurants with an aggregate net book value of approximately million  after taking into consideration impairment charges recorded  which had negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months 
restructuring and exit costs 
as a result of changes in our organizational structure and in our portfolio of restaurants  we have recorded charges for restructuring and exit costs 
these costs consist primarily of the costs of future obligations related to closed restaurants and severance and other restructuring charges for terminated employees 
these costs are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in our consolidated statements of income 
discounted liabilities for future lease costs and the fair value of related subleases of closed restaurants are recorded when the restaurants are closed 
all other costs related to closed restaurants are expensed as incurred 
in assessing the discounted liabilities for future costs of obligations related to closed restaurants  we make assumptions regarding amounts of future subleases 
if these assumptions or their related estimates change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
exit costs recorded for each of the periods presented include the effect of such changes in estimates 
the most significant estimate included in our accrued exit costs liabilities relates to the timing and amount of estimated subleases 
at december   our total discounted liability for closed restaurants was approximately million  net of million related to existing sublease agreements and million related to properties for which we expect to enter into sublease agreements in the future 
if any of the estimates noted above or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
income taxes 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets do not include future tax benefits that we deem likely not to be realized 
during the quarter ended december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets will be utilized 
as a result  we released the majority of our valuation allowance  recognizing a tax benefit of million 
the release of our valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of asc  which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such an assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
our historical operating income and continuing projected income represented sufficient evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
share based compensation 
stock based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of this option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
the fair value of restricted stock units containing a market condition is determined using the monte carlo valuation method  which utilizes multiple input variables to determine the probability of the company achieving the market condition 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
recent accounting pronouncements see the new accounting standards section of note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for further details of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes 
specifically  as of december   borrowings under our term loan and revolver bore interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread of basis points per annum 
up to million of the term loan borrowings has a basis point libor point cap 
based on the levels of borrowings under the credit facility  if interest rates changed by basis points  our annual cash flow and income before taxes would change by approximately million 
this computation is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the credit facility  taking into consideration the interest rate cap 
however  the nature and amount of our borrowings under the credit facility may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
we also have exposure to interest rate risk related to our pension plan  other defined benefit plans and self insurance liabilities 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate would increase or decrease our projected benefit obligation related to our pension plan by approximately million and would impact the pension plan net periodic benefit cost by approximately million 
the impact of a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate would decrease or increase our projected benefit obligation related to our other defined benefit plans by less than million while the plans net periodic benefit cost would remain flat 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate related to our self insurance liabilities would result in a decrease or increase of million  respectively 
commodity price risk we purchase certain food products  such as beef  poultry  pork  eggs and coffee  and utilities such as gas and electricity  which are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control and which are generally unpredictable 
changes in commodity prices affect us and our competitors generally and often simultaneously 
in general  we purchase food products and utilities based upon market prices established with vendors 
although many of the items purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  the majority of our purchasing arrangements are structured to contain features that minimize price volatility by establishing fixed pricing and or price ceilings and floors 
we use these types of purchase arrangements to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  competitive circumstances could limit such actions and  in those circumstances  increases in commodity prices could lower our margins 
because of the often short term nature of commodity pricing aberrations and our ability to change menu pricing or product delivery strategies in response to commodity price increases  we believe that the impact of commodity price risk is not significant 
we have established a policy to identify  control and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and other relevant rates and prices 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes
