this item provides material historical and prospective disclosures enabling investors and other users to assess our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
overview we are a medical device company incorporated in  engaged in the design  development  sales and marketing of an implantable medical device  the vns therapy system  which provides neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and treatment resistant depression trd 
we are also investigating neuromodulation therapy for other indications  including chronic heart failure  and developing non implantable device solutions for the management of epilepsy 
our proprietary vns therapy system includes the following an implantable pulse generator to provide appropriate stimulation to the vagus nerve  a lead that connects the pulse generator to the vagus nerve  surgical instrument equipment to assist with the implant procedure  equipment to enable the treating physician to set the pulse generator stimulation parameters for the patient  instruction manuals  and magnets to suspend or induce stimulation manually 
the vns therapy pulse generator and lead are surgically implanted  generally during an outpatient procedure 
the battery contained in the generator has a finite life  which varies according to the generator model and the stimulation parameters used for each patient 
if a physician determines that a patient s battery is at or near the end of its useful life or that the generator should be replaced for clinical reasons  a patient or a patient s caregiver may choose to implant a new generator 
the generator may be replaced with or without replacing the original lead 
we sell the vns therapy system to hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers ascs on payment terms that are generally days from the shipment date 
in addition to maintaining regulatory approval  our ability to successfully expand the commercialization of the vns therapy system depends on obtaining and maintaining favorable insurance coverage  coding and reimbursement for the device  the implant procedure and follow up care 
this coverage allows our customers to invoice and be paid by third party payers 
currently  we have broad coverage  coding and reimbursement for vns therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy 
cms  which we estimate pays for approximately of the vns therapy system implants  issues an annual update to the reimbursement amounts to be received by our customers 
the reimbursement rates vary by geographic area 
a decrease in reimbursement rates or a change in reimbursement methodology by cms could have an adverse impact on our business and our future operating results 
we continue to invest in and support the development of future generations of our vns therapy system  including generators employing new stimulation paradigms  cardiac based seizure detection  rechargeable battery technology  wireless communication technology and for the integration of mri compatibility with our leads 
we also continue to fund and develop other devices that support our focus on device solutions for epilepsy management  such as seizure monitoring  logging and notification technology using external heart monitoring and movement related sensor advancements 
in addition  we are investing in a pilot study related to the use of vns therapy for the treatment of chronic heart failure 
we also sponsor post marketing studies in refractory epilepsy and support a variety of studies for our product development efforts or to build clinical evidence for vns therapy 

table of contents following a february limited commercial release of our aspirehc generator and then an august recall of our aspirehc generator and investigational aspiresr generator  we received ce mark approval in november and fda approval in december for our redesigned aspirehc generator  and we resumed our full commercial release in the us and europe 
the aspirehc generator  with its enhanced battery life  is the platform for our aspiresr generator 
in april  we commenced a european clinical study designated e to support regulatory approval in europe of our aspiresr generator 
the aspiresr generator employs a cardiac based seizure detection system and delivers responsive vns therapy 
we suspended this study with the august product withdrawal  restarted it in june  and we continue to enroll patients 
in september  we submitted an investigational device exemption ide request to the fda for the purpose of conducting a us pilot study of the aspiresr generator designated e 
the ide was approved in december  and our clinical team is working with research sites and institutional review boards to complete activities necessary to initiate the first implant 
proprietary protection for our products is important to our business 
we seek us and foreign patents on selected inventions  acquire licenses under selected patents of third parties  and enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  vendors and consultants with respect to technology that we consider important to our business 
we also rely on trade secrets  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our epilepsy related patents have expired in both the us and europe 
we are aware of several neuromodulation based medical devices approved for the treatment of epilepsy in the european market  and it is possible that one or more companies may enter the us market for the treatment of epilepsy 
we do not have indication specific patent coverage for vagus nerve stimulation for epilepsy or for neuropsychiatric disorders depression in the us or europe 
we continuously evaluate whether to out license or to in license intellectual property rights to optimize our portfolio 
this includes identifying our intellectual property rights for indications we do not have plans to develop and determining whether these rights can be licensed or otherwise granted to third parties 
it also involves assessing the intellectual property rights owned by third parties to determine whether we should attempt to license or otherwise acquire those rights 
we have entered into several license and investment agreements that may involve substantial future payments  see note commitments and contingencies license agreements in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
to secure our future in our current manufacturing and headquarters facility and to realize operating efficiencies  we purchased the building in which we are headquartered during the quarter ended october in order to accommodate expected growth of our business  during the quarter ended october   we created the following subsidiaries cyberonics holdings llc  cybx netherlands cv  cyberonics spain  cv and cyberonics latam  srl in september  our subsidiary  cyberonics latam  srl  contracted to purchase land and construct a manufacturing facility in costa rica 
we have commenced construction  and we intend for this facility to be fully operational for the manufacture of our products for international markets in fiscal year 
table of contents significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation  or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical intangible assets intangible assets  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  consisted of purchased licenses of patents and technology rights that are feasible and ready to integrate into our products 
the technology rights are purchased from our collaborative partners and pertain primarily to seizure detection  wireless communication  rechargeable battery technology  external charging accessory hardware and associated software  the integration of mri compatibility with our leads and micro processor technologies 
we amortize our intangible assets on a straight line basis  over an average period of years  beginning with the effective date of the license agreement and ending with the shorter of either the expiration of the license or with the estimated end of the useful life of the product 
we evaluate our intellectual property each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances indicate either a different amortization period or impairment 
the intangible asset is impaired if the technology no longer factors into our product commercialization plans 
the risks associated with achieving commercialization include  but are not limited to  failure of the acquired technology to function as planned  failure to obtain regulatory approvals for clinical trials  failure of clinical trials  failure to obtain regulatory approval to market  failure to obtain insurance reimbursement and patent litigation 
amortization and impairment are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment 
if we change our estimate of the useful lives of our intellectual property  we amortize the carrying amount over the revised remaining useful life 
if we identify an impairment indicator  we test the intellectual property for recoverability  and if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  impairment is recognized 
the carrying value of our intangible assets amounted to million at april  investments in equity securities we invested in two privately held start up entities with a total carrying value of million as of april  the investments consist of convertible preferred shares accounted for under the cost method 
we own less than of the equity of these entities and do not exercise significant influence 
the carrying value of these entities are reviewed each period for impairment 
as of april  we have not impaired these investments because there have been no identified events or changes in circumstances that indicate a significant adverse effect on the carrying value 
impairment adjustments are subject to a high degree of management judgment as these investments do not have quoted market prices 
we cannot guarantee that such investments will be successful or will not adversely affect our consolidated balance sheet  statement of income or cash flow 
see note investments and note fair value measurements  for further details of these investments 

table of contents investments in debt securities we invested million in the convertible debt of a privately held medical start up entity in the quarter ended october   which we accounted for at fair value as an available for sale debt security 
we reviewed this investment for impairment on a reoccurring basis 
impairment of this investment was subject to a high degree of management judgment as this investment did not have a quoted market price 
in the quarter ended july   we recorded an impairment loss and reduced the carrying value of this investment in the amount of million 
in the quarter ended april   we foreclosed on the debt and took possession of assets equal to the carrying value of the debt 
see note investments and note fair value measurements  for further details of this investment 
revenue recognition product revenue we sell our products through a direct sales force in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in international markets 
we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfers to customers or our independent distributors and maintain policies for sales returns and exchanges 
we estimate sales returns based on historical data and record a reduction in sales and a return reserve when we sell the initial product 
the balance of our reserve for sales returns for the fiscal years ending april  and april  was million and million  respectively 
our increasing business activity  new product introductions and variations in product utilization could cause product returns to differ from our estimates 
license revenue we amortize upfront payments received under license agreements over the life of our obligations under the agreements to prosecute the licensed patent applications 
effective in december  we entered into an agreement granting an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications pertaining to weight reduction  hypertension and diabetes in exchange for an up front  non refundable payment of million  plus a royalty on future commercial sales of any product covered by the licensed patents 
we retain the responsibility to prosecute the licensed patent applications and estimate that our obligation will be satisfied during the fiscal year accordingly  we have recognized revenue of approximately million per quarter based on the straight line amortization of the million payment 
however  a change in our estimate of the amortization period or a release of our obligation to prosecute the patent applications could materially change the timing of the recognition of the license revenue 
stock based compensation stock option awards our stock option award compensation expense is based on the fair market value of our awards 
the fair market value of an award is amortized over the award vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing methodology to estimate the grant date fair market value of stock option award 
this methodology takes into account variables such as the future expected volatility of our stock price  the amount of time expected to elapse between the date of grant and the date of exercise and a risk free interest rate 
fair values of stock options issued in the future may vary significantly from fair values recorded in the current period depending on our estimates of these variables and therefore expense in future periods may differ significantly from current period stock option compensation expenses 
in addition  compensation expense may vary significantly from our estimates if forfeiture rates differ from our expectations 
the estimated forfeiture rate used for stock option awards granted during the fiscal year ended april  ranged from to 
recognized compensation cost for stock option awards for the weeks ended april   april  and april  was million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards service based restricted stock 
we grant restricted stock and restricted stock units at no purchase cost to the grantee 
the fair market values of serviced based restricted stock and restricted stock units are determined using the market closing price on the grant date and compensation is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
calculation of compensation for service based restricted share awards requires estimation of employee turnover and forfeiture rates 
compensation expense may vary significantly from our estimates if employee turnover rates differ from our expectations 
the estimated forfeiture rates used for restricted share awards and share unit awards during the fiscal year ended april  ranged from to 
market and performance based restricted stock and performance based restricted stock units 
we grant restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards subject to market or performance conditions that vest based on the satisfaction of the conditions of the award 
the fair market values of market condition based awards are determined using the monte carlo simulation method 
the monte carlo simulation method is subject to variability as several factors utilized must be estimated  including the derived service period estimate based on our judgment of likely future performance and our stock price volatility 
the fair value of performance based awards is based on the market closing price on the grant date 
derived service periods and the periods charged with compensation expense for performance based awards are estimated based on our judgment of likely future performance and may be adjusted significantly in future periods depending on actual performance 
recognized compensation cost for service based  performance based and market based restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for the weeks ended april   april  and april  was million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to federal  state and foreign income taxes  and we use significant judgment and estimates in accounting for our income taxes 
this involves assessing the changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of events for tax and accounting purposes 
these assessments result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense compared to pre tax income yields an effective tax rate 
actual tax expense may significantly differ from our expectations if  for example  judicial interpretations of tax law or tax rates change 
cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined 
we periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized 
to the extent that realization does not meet the more likely than not criterion  we establish a valuation allowance 
we periodically review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released 
this evidence includes a profitability in the most recent fiscal years  b internal forecasts for the current and next two future fiscal years  c size of the deferred tax asset relative to estimated profitability  d the potential effects on future profitability from increasing competition  healthcare reforms and overall economic conditions  e limitations and potential limitations on the use of our net operating losses due to ownership changes  pursuant to internal revenue code irc section  and f the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  if any 
projecting future taxable income requires significant judgment about the trend and nature of our sales and operating expenses  which include an evaluation of the potential effects of new markets  changing technology  patent protection  governmental and private insurance reimbursement trends and regulatory trends 
changes in our assessment of the factors related to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could result in materially different income tax provisions 

table of contents during fiscal year we released valuation allowance of million related to our us net operating losses nol carryforward deferred tax asset based upon usage of our federal and state nol 
this reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded as a tax benefit in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet due to the nature of the nol  which was created with excess tax benefits on exercise of options prior to adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised share based payments on april  during fiscal year  based on our evaluation of the recoverability of our us deferred tax assets  we reduced our valuation allowance by million  of which million was recorded as a tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income and million was recorded as a benefit in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal year  based on our evaluation of the recoverability of our us deferred tax assets  we reduced our valuation allowance by million 
this reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded as a tax benefit in our consolidated statement of income 
in addition  during fiscal year  we released valuation allowance of million related to the utilization and adjustment of nol from foreign operations 
the remaining valuation allowance related to foreign operations has not been released as it is not considered more likely than not that the net operating losses will be able to be utilized 
we will continue to evaluate whether to release the cumulative valuation allowance related to foreign nol during fiscal year at april   we had a total valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax asset based on the nol s from our foreign operations  our excess tax benefits from stock based awards and other tax attributes 
we operate in europe with a subsidiary  cyberonics europe bvba sprl cyberonics europe bvba 
cyberonics europe bvba  based in belgium  is the successor organization arising from the restructuring of cyberonics  nv sa  which was also based in belgium 
we made an election to treat cyberonics europe bvba as a disregarded entity for us federal tax purposes during fiscal year in conjunction with this transaction  we recognized a net million income tax benefit resulting from claiming a worthless stock deduction with respect to the shares we own in cyberonics europe bvba 
the internal revenue service irs could challenge the characterization of this type of transaction 
the resolution of any challenge could result in reversal of all  part or none of the benefit recorded during fiscal year consequently  we have estimated and recorded a million liability for uncertain tax benefits  which increased our fiscal year income tax provision 
changes in our assessment of the factors related to sustainability of this deduction would have resulted in a materially different income tax provision 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year was approximately  including the impact of federal tax rate of  state and foreign income taxes  the impact of the retroactive enactment of the research development tax credit covering the period january  through april   which includes four months from the prior fiscal year  the non taxability of the gain on the warrant s liability  meals entertainment expenditures  an uncertain tax position associated with the neurovista debt obligation impairment and other permanent differences 
the federal r d tax credit was enacted into law on january  by the american taxpayer relief act of  which retroactively extended the r d tax credit for two years  from january  to december  our effective tax rate for fiscal year was approximately  including the impact of federal tax rate of  state and foreign income taxes  and the impact of shortfalls resulting from stock option exercises or cancellations and restricted stock vesting 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year will be approximately 
our cash payments for income taxes for fiscal year and fiscal year were approximately and of income before tax  respectively 
we estimate increased cash tax payments of approximately to in fiscal year due to the full utilization of our tax net operating losses during fiscal year tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes 
we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of our reserves for uncertain tax positions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of these audits and the actual outcome of an audit could have a material impact on our consolidated results of income  financial position or cash flows 
during the weeks ended october   we finalized the irs audit in connection with our fiscal years ended april  and april  the audit adjustments did not materially impact our consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents in addition  during the weeks ended april   we were notified that our european subsidiary  cyberonics europe bvba  is under examination by the belgium tax authority with respect to transfer pricing for fiscal years and we are unable to assess the impact the examination may have on our consolidated financial statements  on our cumulative belgium tax losses through fiscal year of million  and on our us tax position

refer to the product withdrawal paragraph below for more information 
these reductions to cost of sales as a percent of net sales were partially offset by increased international sales with lower average selling prices as compared to the us market and the excise tax on medical devices sold domestically for four months beginning january  that added million or to cost of sales 
our cost of sales as a percent of net sales for the weeks ended april  decreased by percentage points to when compared to the weeks ended april  this decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in patent royalty fee which reduced cost of sales by million  and partially due to the improved efficiencies with the purchase of our headquarters building and higher production volumes

table of contents we believe our current liquidity and capital resources will be adequate to fund anticipated business activities through the end of fiscal year our liquidity could be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results  including those referred to in item a 
risk factors above 
factors affecting future operating results and common stock price the factors affecting our future operating results and common stock prices are disclosed in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from foreign currency exchange rates  concentration of credit and concentration of procurement suppliers that could adversely affect our consolidated balance sheet  net income and cash flow 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  at certain times  derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings  particularly with respect to the us dollar versus the euro and great britain pound 
starting in the second quarter of fiscal year and ending in the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into foreign currency forward derivative contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated primarily by a foreign currency denominated receivable from our european subsidiary 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recapitalized our european subsidiary  eliminated the inter company euro receivable  and as a consequence  did not purchase a foreign currency derivative during or after the fourth quarter of fiscal in the future  we may use non speculative hedging to reduce our exposure to foreign currency transactions depending on cash flow in our european operations 
we choose not to offset other foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to immateriality  accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of offsetting particular exposures 
based on our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  and not taking into consideration foreign currency derivative offsets  a sensitivity analysis indicates that if the us dollar had uniformly weakened against the euro and the great britain pound  the effect on net income after tax for the weeks ended april  would have been unfavorable by approximately  or 
conversely  if the us dollar had uniformly strengthened against the euro and the great britain pound  the impact on net income after tax for the weeks ended april  would have been favorable by approximately  or 
concentration of credit risk our trade accounts receivable represent potential concentrations of credit risk 
this risk is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and our efforts to control our exposure to credit risk by monitoring our receivables and the use of credit approvals and credit limits 
in addition  historically we have had strong collections and minimal write offs 
while we believe that our reserves for credit losses are adequate  essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the hospital and healthcare sectors in the us and several other countries  and accordingly  we are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
although we do not currently foresee a concentrated credit risk associated with these receivables  repayment is dependent on the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economies and healthcare systems
