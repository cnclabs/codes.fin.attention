item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
industrial engines in equipment such as forklifts  aerial platforms  sweepers  turf equipment  power generators and other mobile industrial equipment have long been workhorses of developed countries and comprise a significant portion of our global business 
with developed countries such as the united states  and the countries in asia and europe seeking a broader consensus on regulation of emission sources in an attempt to further reduce air pollution  many countries have legislated  and we believe will continue to legislate  emission standards for this type of equipment 
our industrial brands focus on serving the market with fuel systems  services and emission certified engine packages 
with the imposition of new emissions regulations  oems will require advanced technologies that permit the use of gaseous fuels in order to satisfy not only new regulations but also their customers requirements for durability  performance and reliability

table of contents we are working with a number of our customers to address their future product and application requirements as they integrate more advanced  certified gaseous fuel systems into their business strategies 
additionally  we continually survey and evaluate the benefits of joint ventures  acquisitions and strategic alliances with our customers and other participants in the alternative fuel industry to strengthen our global business position 
in and  no customers represented more than of our consolidated sales 
in  one customer represented of our consolidated sales 
during   and  sales to our top ten customers accounted for   and of our consolidated sales  respectively 
if our largest customer or several of these key customers were to reduce their orders substantially  we would suffer a decline in sales and profits  and those declines could be substantial 
products and services our products include gaseous fuel regulators  fuel shut off valves  fuel metering and delivery systems  complete engine systems  auxiliary power systems and electronic controls for use in internal combustion engines for the transportation  industrial and power generation markets 
in addition to these core products  which we manufacture  we also design  assemble and market ancillary components required for complete systems operation on alternative fuels

our operations focus on oem and aftermarket distributors in the transportation  industrial and power generation markets 
of these markets  we believe that the greatest potential for growth is in the  asia  north and south america and middle east regions in sales to transportation oems and aftermarket distributors and installers and in north america in sales to industrial oems and the related aftermarket 
during the years   and  sales to distributors accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenue  and sales to oem customers accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenue 
distributors generally service the aftermarket business for the conversion of liquid fueled engines to gaseous fuels 
many domestic distributors have been our customers for more than years  and many of our export distributors have been our customers for more than years 

table of contents information regarding revenue  income and assets of each of our two business segments  fss industrial operations and fss automotive operations  and our revenue and assets by geographic area is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k as well as in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing we manufacture and assemble a majority of our products at our facilities in santa ana  california  union city  indiana  kitchener  canada  beccar  argentina and cherasco  italy and to a lesser extent at some of our other international facilities 
current manufacturing operations consist primarily of mechanical component assembly and test  forging and light machining  electronic pcb assembly and testing and system up fitting 
we rely on outside suppliers for parts and components and obtain components for products from a variety of domestic and foreign automotive and electronics suppliers  die casters  stamping operations  specialized diaphragm manufacturers and machine shops 
during and  no suppliers represented more than of consolidated purchases of raw materials and services 
during  one supplier represented of the consolidated purchases of raw materials and services 
machined die cast aluminum parts and supplier engineered parts represent the major components of our cost of sales 
coordination with suppliers for quality control and timely shipments is a high priority to maximize inventory management 
we use a computerized material requirement planning system to schedule material flow and balance the competing demands of timely shipments  productivity and inventory management 
our manufacturing facilities in california  canada  and argentina are iso certified  while the facilities in italy are iso ts and iso certified 
research and development our research and development programs provide the technical capabilities that are required for the development of systems and products that support the use of gaseous fuels in internal combustion engines 
our research and development is focused on fuel delivery and electronic control systems and products for motor vehicles  engines  forklifts  stationary engines and small industrial engines 
in  we expanded our research and development facility in italy to continue to serve our customers with new products and capabilities 
in  we expanded our research and development facilities in the us to address the increasing us automotive market 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
competition our key competitors in gaseous fuel delivery products  accessory components and engine conversions markets include westport innovations inc in canada and its subsidiaries omvl  srl and emer  srl in italy  landi group and omt tartarini  omt located in italy  nikki company ltd 
in japan 
these companies  together with us  account for a majority of the world market for alternative fuel products and services 
in the future  we may face competition from traditional automotive component suppliers  such as the bosch group  delphi corporation  siemens vdo automotive ag and visteon corporation  and from motor vehicle oems that develop fuel systems internally 
industry participants compete on price  product performance and customer support 
product certification we must obtain emission compliance certification from the environmental protection agency to sell certain of our products in the united states  receive certification from carb to sell certain products in california and other states  and meet european standards for emission regulations in europe 
each car  truck or van sold in each of these markets must be certified before it can be introduced into commerce  and its products must meet component  subsystem and system level durability  emission  refueling and various idle tests 
we have also 
table of contents obtained international emissions compliance certification in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  chile  europe  russia  mexico and thailand 
we strive to meet stringent industry standards set by various regulatory bodies 
approvals enhance the acceptability of our products in the worldwide marketplace 
many foreign countries also accept these agency approvals as satisfying the approval for sale requirements in their markets 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  persons 
of these employees  approximately were employed in our fss industrial operations  of which are non us employees  and approximately  were employed in our fss automotive operations  of which  are foreign employees 
employees in italy  the netherlands and argentina are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
personnel employed by our foreign subsidiaries are often subject to national labor contracts 
we consider our relations with our current employees and unions to be good 
intellectual property we currently rely primarily on patent and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property 
we currently have over patents registered in countries located in north america  europe  and asia 
we do not expect the expiration of our patents to have a material effect on our revenue 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws and various contract rights to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights provide sufficient protection from competition 
we believe that our intellectual property protected by copyright and trademark protection is less significant than our intellectual property protected by patents 
third parties may claim that our products and systems infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
identifying third party patent rights can be particularly difficult  especially since patent applications are not published until months after their filing dates 
if a competitor were to challenge our patents  or assert that our products or processes infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial litigation costs  be forced to design around their patents  pay substantial damages or even be forced to cease our operations  any of which could be expensive and or have an adverse effect on our operating results 
third party infringement claims  regardless of their outcome  would not only consume our financial resources  but also would divert the time and effort of our management and could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products or services until resolution of the litigation

risk factors 
the unpredictable nature of the developing alternative fuel us automotive business may materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
although we believe that we are positioned to compete in the dedicated and bi fuel natural gas vehicle ngv oem market emerging in the us and our vehicle modification and systems integration capabilities for a variety of alternative fuel applications including hybrid  cng  propane and dual fuel diesel present us with a unique advantage  the unpredictable nature of the developing alternative fuel us automotive business may materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows as well as the recoverability of our initial investments 
our us automotive business  through recent acquisitions and additional investments  has the capabilities necessary to be a leader in this market but we can not assure you that this us market will continue to develop or result in increased sales for us 
the development of our business is dependent on the availability of gaseous fueling infrastructure many countries  including the united states  currently have limited or no infrastructure to deliver natural gas and propane to vehicle based consumers 
currently in the united states  alternative fuels such as natural gas cannot be readily obtained by consumers for motor vehicle use and only a small percentage of motor vehicles manufactured for the united states are equipped to use alternative fuels 
users of gaseous fuel vehicles may not be able to obtain fuel conveniently and affordably  which may adversely affect the demand for our products and services 
we cannot assure you that the united states or global market for gaseous fuel engines will expand broadly or  if it does  that it will result in increased sales of our fuel system products 
reduced consumer or corporate spending due to weakness in the financial markets and uncertainties in the economy  domestically and internationally  may materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
we depend on demand from the consumer  oem  contract manufacturing  industrial  automotive and other markets we serve for the end market applications that use our products and services 
all of these markets have been  and may continue to be  affected by the recent instability in global financial markets that have caused extreme economic disruption 
reductions in consumer or corporate demand for our products and services as a result of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment  such as volatile energy prices  inflation  fluctuations in interest rates  difficulty securing credit  extreme volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity  or other economic factors  may materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
negative economic conditions  as those being experienced in europe  may materially impact our customers and suppliers with which we do business 
currently  the demand in europe for new automobiles is at its weakest in nearly two decades 
economic and financial market conditions that adversely affect our customers may cause them to terminate existing purchase orders  reduce the volume of products they purchase from us in the future or seek price concessions 
in connection with the sale of products  we normally do not require collateral as security for customer receivables and do not purchase credit insurance 
we may have significant balances owing from customers who operate in cyclical industries or who may not be able to secure sufficient credit in order to honor their obligations to us 
failure to collect a significant portion of amounts due on those receivables could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to provide materials and components to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us  such as shortening the required payment period for our amounts owing them or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us 
while we have not yet experienced changes of this type  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial markets conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for  and respond to  those changes  and we could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents the european union debt crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
the possibility that certain european union eu member states will default on their debt obligations and are being required to pay significantly increased borrowing costs has negatively impacted economic conditions and contributed to instability in global markets 
the continued uncertainty over the outcome of the eu s financial support programs and the possibility that eu member states may experience serious financing obstacles could further disrupt global markets 
the current debt crisis in the eu has also caused the value of the euro to further fluctuate 
deterioration in the value of the euro may adversely affect our customers in those countries 
the world has experienced a global macroeconomic downturn 
the eu debt crisis may adversely affect global market conditions and has adversely affected economic growth in the eu and other parts of europe 
if economic conditions in our key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further  customer demand for our products could decline  and we may experience material adverse impacts on our business and operating results 
we maintain a majority of our investments and liquidity in italy and other eu countries  much of it in banks in italy 
while we have adopted investment and treasury policies which are intended to mitigate any adverse effect from the eu debt crisis  we are unable to provide assurances that the financing tension caused by the eu debt crisis will not affect our liquidity and financial resources 
currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and overall financial results 
because of our significant operations outside of the united states  we engage in business relationships and transactions that involve many different currencies 
exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in these foreign locations where we do business can vary unpredictably 
these variations may have an effect on the prices we pay for key materials and services from overseas vendors in our functional currencies under agreements that are priced in local currencies 
if the rate of the us dollar depreciates against local currencies  our effective costs for such materials and services would increase  adversely affecting our operating results and cash flows 
for the year ended december   non us operations accounted for approximately of our revenue 
most revenues and expenses of our non us operations are in local currency 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars  therefore  gains and losses on the conversion of foreign currency denominated expenses into us dollars could cause fluctuations in our operating results  and fluctuating exchange rates could cause significantly reduced revenue and gross margins from non us dollar denominated revenue  which could materially and adversely affect our overall financial results 
also  for the year ended december   euro denominated revenue accounted for approximately of our total revenue  therefore a substantial appreciation in the rate of exchange of the us dollar against the euro could have a significant adverse affect on our financial results 
we currently do not engage in financial hedging against these risks and may not be able to hedge against these risks in the future 
we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anti bribery laws 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit companies and their intermediaries and agents from making improper payments to foreign officials  including employees of government owned businesses  for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
during the last few years  the united states department of justice and the sec have brought an increasing number of 
table of contents fcpa enforcement cases  many resulting in very large fines and deferred criminal prosecutions 
we operate in many countries which are viewed as high risk for fcpa compliance 
our code of conduct mandates compliance with the fcpa and other similar anti bribery laws 
we recently instituted training programs for our employees around the world 
despite our training programs and compliance policies  there can be no assurance that all employees and third party intermediaries including our distributors and agents will comply with anti corruption laws 
any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as part of our anti bribery policies  in the event that we have reason to believe that our employees  agents  distributors or other third parties that transact the company s business have or may have violated applicable anti corruption laws  including the fcpa  we may investigate or have outside counsel or agents investigate the relevant facts and circumstances 
we have incurred and in the future may incur additional compliance costs associated with the implementation of our fcpa compliance policies and training programs  which could have a material impact on our business 
in any acquisition or joint venture we engage in  we expose ourselves to the possibility that the employees and agents of such businesses may not have conducted themselves in compliance with the anti corruption laws of the fcpa 
in response to increasing fcpa enforcement actions in the united states  we have sought to impose contractual provisions and undertake cost appropriate due diligence 
we cannot provide assurance that we will always be protected from the consequences of acts which may have violated the fcpa 
violations of the fcpa may result in significant civil and criminal fines  as well as criminal convictions 
violations of the fcpa and other foreign anti bribery laws  or allegations of such violations  could disrupt our business and cause us to suffer civil and criminal financial penalties and other sanctions  which are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are subject to governmental certification requirements and other regulations  and more stringent regulations in the future may impair our ability to market our products 
we must obtain product certification from governmental agencies  such as the environmental protection agency and the california air resources board  to sell certain of our products in the united states and must obtain other product certification requirements in europe and other regions 
a significant portion of our future revenue will depend upon sales of fuel management products that are certified to meet existing and future air quality and energy standards 
we cannot assure you that our products will meet these standards in the future 
we incur significant research and developments costs to ensure that our products comply with emissions standards and meet certification requirements in the countries where our products are sold 
our failure to comply with certification requirements could result in the recall of our products as well as civil and or criminal penalties 
any new government regulation that affects our alternative fuel technologies  whether at the foreign  federal  state  or local level  including any regulations relating to installation and service of these systems  may increase our costs and the price of our systems and adversely affect the effectiveness of the related technologies 
as a result  these regulations could materially and adversely affect us 
we maintain a significant investment in inventory and have made significant investments in the expansion of our operations to meet demand for our product without long term contracts with customers 
a decline in our customers purchases would lead to a decline in our revenue and could result in a decrease in our operating results and cash flows 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
generally  our product sales are made on a purchase order basis  which allows our customers to reduce or discontinue their purchases from us 
accordingly  we cannot predict the timing  frequency or size of our future customer orders 
our ability to accurately forecast our sales is further complicated by the current global economic and financial uncertainty 
we maintain significant inventories approximately of total inventory at fss automotive group  the principal operating company in our transportation division  in an effort to ensure that our european transportation customers have a reliable source of supply 
our total inventory at december  was million  an increase of million compared to our total inventory at december  if we fail to anticipate the 
table of contents changing needs of our customers and accurately forecast our customer demands  our existing and potential customers may not place orders with us  which would decrease our revenue  and we may accumulate significant inventories of products that we will be unable to sell which may result in a significant decline in the value of our inventory 
as a result  our revenue  gross profit and other operating results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we expanded our operational capacity  including opening new facilities in italy  to address increased demand for our fuel systems components and systems  and we increased substantially our investment in research and development 
we may continue to make significant investments in our business without any guarantees or long term commitments from our customers that they will continue to purchase our components and systems with the same timing  frequency and size as we expect 
as a result  if there is insufficient demand for our components and systems  we may not recover the costs of any increased investment in our operations  which could have a material  adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
an expansion of oem offering of gaseous fuel vehicles employing internally developed oem technology would likely result in a decrease in our revenue and profit margins 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of gaseous fuel systems and components to automobile oems 
an expansion in the offering of oem gaseous fuel vehicles employing internally developed oem technology could reduce demand for our systems and components and would likely have a negative impact on our revenue and profits 
we currently face  and will continue to face  significant competition  which could materially and adversely affect us 
we currently compete with companies that manufacture products to convert liquid fueled internal combustion engines to gaseous fuels 
our competitors in the future may have greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader global reach and a wider array of product lines  as well as greater financial resources and access to capital than we have 
we are also subject to competition from other alternative fuels and alternative fuel technologies  including ethanol  electric and hybrid electric and fuel cells  and we cannot assure you that such technologies will not be favored over gaseous fuel technologies in the future 
we also cannot assure you that our competitors will not create new and improved innovative gaseous fuel technologies 
increases in the market for alternative fuel vehicles may cause automobile or engine manufacturers to develop and produce their own fuel conversion or fuel management equipment rather than purchasing the equipment from suppliers such as us or to employ competing technologies 
further  greater acceptance of alternative fuel engines may result in new competitors 
should any of these events occur  either alone or in combination  the total potential demand for  and pricing of  our products could be negatively affected and cause us to lose business  which could materially and adversely affect us 
new technologies may render our existing products obsolete  which could materially and adversely affect us 
new developments in technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products obsolete 
our inability to enhance existing products in a timely manner or to develop and introduce new products that incorporate new technologies  conform to increasingly stringent emission standards and performance requirements  and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could negatively impact our competitive position and may materially and adversely affect us 
new product development or modification is costly  involves significant research  development  time and expense and may not necessarily result in the successful commercialization of any new products 

table of contents fluctuation in oil or natural gas prices may result in a decline in the demand for our products and services  which would materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
we believe that our sales are favorably impacted by changes in consumer demand prompted by rising oil prices and concern over potential increases in oil prices 
conversely  when oil prices decrease and remain low or continue to decrease  it may result in a decline of the demand for our products and services 
in addition  volatility in the price of natural gas may have an equal though opposite impact on the demand for our products and services 
the potential decline in the demand for our products and services caused by these price fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
our business is directly and significantly affected by regulations relating to reducing vehicle emissions 
if current regulations are repealed or if the implementation of current regulations is suspended or delayed  our revenue  operating results and cash flows may decrease significantly 
if regulations relating to vehicle emissions are amended in a manner that may allow for more lenient standards  or if the implementation of such currently existing standards is delayed or suspended  the demand for our products and services could diminish  and our revenue  operating results and cash flows could decrease significantly 
in addition  demand for our products and services may be adversely affected by the perception that emission regulations will be suspended or delayed 
accordingly  we rely on stricter emissions regulations  the adoption of which are out of our control and cannot be assured  to stimulate our growth 
changes in tax policies and governmental incentives may reduce or eliminate the economic benefits that make our products attractive to consumers  which could materially and adversely affect us 
in some jurisdictions and from time to time  government authorities may provide tax benefits and incentives for clean air vehicles  including tax credits  rebates and reductions in applicable tax rates 
in certain of our markets  these benefits extend to vehicles powered by our systems and create economic benefits for our customers 
changes in these tax benefits or incentives  such as the expiration at the end of of the italian government s economic incentives for the purchase of new dual fuel consumer automobiles  may reduce or eliminate the economic benefits that make our products attractive to customers  which could materially and adversely affect us 
government authorities in some countries may from time to time use fuel prices as an instrument of fiscal policy and taxation may vary for different types of fuels  including gaseous fuels 
changes in taxation can affect the retail prices for alternative fuels which can negatively impact the attractiveness of our products 
some of our foreign subsidiaries have done  and may continue to do  business in countries subject to us sanctions and embargoes 
some of our foreign subsidiaries in the past have sold fuel delivery systems  related parts and accessories to customers in countries currently subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the us government  the european union eu  the united nations  and other countries when we did not believe such sales violated these sanctions or embargoes 
we may sell products into countries currently subject to sanctions or embargoes if we believe those sales would not violate the sanctions or embargos and the changing embargo regimes with respect to such countries do not present inappropriate business risks 
however  the sanctions are complex and are constantly changing 
changing embargo and sanction regimes can make unlawful activities which were previously lawful 
we may decide not to sell into countries because of the risk of changing regimes 
we believe we have procedures in place to conduct us and foreign operations without violating us  eu  or other sanctions 
however  if we fail to comply with us sanctions  eu sanctions or other sanctions  we could be subject to material fines and penalties and incur damage to our reputation  which may lead to a reduction in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries sales into such countries  even if they did not violate the sanctions and embargos  could reduce demand for our common stock among certain of our investors 

table of contents new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses  may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers 
on august   under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the sec adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals  known as conflict minerals  in their products  whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties 
these requirements will require companies to perform due diligence  disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
although it is not clear whether these requirements will apply to us  the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of our products 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements  including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products 
since our supply chain is complex  we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement  which may harm our reputation 
in addition  we may incur additional costs as a result of changes to product  processes or sources of supply as a consequence of these new requirements 
we engage in related party transactions  which result in a conflict of interest involving our management 
we have engaged in the past  and continue to engage  in a significant number of related party transactions  specifically between the company s foreign subsidiaries and members of the family of our chief executive officer  director and largest stockholder  his brother pier antonio costamagna one of our executive officers who is general manager of mtm  srl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  companies in which our chief executive officer s family has controlling or other ownership interests 
our board  its audit committee and its nominating and corporate governance committee seek to review on an ongoing basis related party transactions as well as new transactions which may be proposed for various issues related to the effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that the terms of the transactions with these various related parties are on terms as favorable to us as those that could have been obtained in arm s length transactions with third parties  or that the existing policies and procedures are sufficient to identify and completely address conflicts of interest that may arise 
related party transactions could result in related parties receiving more favorable treatment than an unaffiliated third party would receive  although these parties may provide goods or services that are not readily available elsewhere in some situations 
in addition  related party transactions present difficult conflicts of interest  could result in significant and minor disadvantages to our company and may impair investor confidence  which could materially and adversely affect us 
related party transactions could also cause us to become materially dependent on related parties in the ongoing conduct of our business  and related parties may be motivated by personal interests to pursue courses of action that are not necessarily in the best interests of our company and our stockholders 
rohan brc  our india joint venture  has suffered financial losses and may be unable to pay on amounts owed to our subsidiary mtm for the purchase of components 
we have invested in a joint venture in india  rohan brc 
rohan brc s losses over the period of our investment have exceeded the aggregate amount of our investment in and loans to rohan brc 
we have over different periods impaired the entire balance of the loans and the investment due to the losses 
in addition  our subsidiary mtm sells components to rohan brc 
in the third quarter of  we began accounting for new sales to rohan brc on the cash basis  revenue attributed to new sales to rohan brc was deferred until receipt of payment and all goods sold to rohan brc and not paid for by rohan brc was then recorded for accounting purposes on a consignment basis 
as of december   the receivable recorded to rohan brc totaled million and the inventory recorded as on consignment totaled million 
we may never realize any value from our investment or loans to rohan brc 
moreover  rohan brc may be unable to pay amounts owed to mtm and we do not have the ability to control their day to day operations or their management 

table of contents we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets that may become impaired  which could impact our results of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million representing the write off of goodwill and an impairment charge of approximately million representing write off of intangible assets associated with two of our reporting units 
approximately million  or  of our total assets at december  were net intangible assets  including technology  customer relationships and trade name  and approximately million  or  of our total assets at december  were goodwill that relates to our acquisitions 
we amortize the intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill  based on our estimate of their remaining useful lives and their values at the time of acquisition 
we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis  or earlier if we determine it may be impaired due to change in circumstances 
we are required to test the other intangible assets with definite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the intangible assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment exists in any of these assets  we are required to write down the related asset to its estimated recoverable value as of the measurement date 
such impairment write downs may significantly impact our results of operations and financial position 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired businesses or any future acquired businesses into our existing worldwide business without substantial expenses  delays or other operational or financial problems 
as a part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire additional businesses  technologies or products in the future 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition or any future transaction we complete will result in long term benefits to us or our stockholders or that our management will be able to integrate or manage the acquired business effectively  efficiently and in a timely manner 
we could also incur unanticipated expenses or losses in connection with any acquisition  including as a result of disputes associated with an earn out right  or future transaction 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties associated with the integration of operations  technologies  products and personnel that  if realized  could harm our operating results 
risks related to potential acquisitions include  but are not limited to difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices  accounting practices  customs and importation regulations  language and other barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies  substantial diversion of management s time and attention from day to day business when evaluating and negotiating such transactions and then integrating an acquired business  discovery  after completion of the acquisition  of liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets acquired that are not realizable  costs and delays in implementing  and the potential difficulty in maintaining  uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  including the integration of different information systems  the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies  and failure to achieve anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements 

table of contents we face risks associated with marketing  distributing  and servicing our products internationally and could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets or as a result of political and economic instability or civil unrest in these markets

political and economic instability or civil unrest in the markets where we operate  including venezuela  could have a material adverse impact on our sales 
our combined international operations are subject to various risks common to international activities  such as the following our ability to maintain good relations with our overseas employees  suppliers  distributors and customers to collect amounts owed from our overseas customers  the possibility that our distributors and agents will continue to sell products into countries subject to united states sanctions notwithstanding our policies prohibiting such sales  expenses and administrative difficulties associated with maintaining a significant labor force outside the united states  including  without limitation  the need to comply with employment and tax laws and to adhere to the terms of real property leases and other financing arrangements in foreign nations  exposure to currency fluctuations  potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations  including product certification  environmental  and import and export laws  the challenges of operating in disparate geographies and cultures  political and economic instability  and adverse tax consequences  including  without limitation  restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries 
we depend on a limited number of third party suppliers for key materials and components for our products 
we have established relationships with third party suppliers that provide materials and components for our products 
a supplier s failure to supply materials or components in a timely manner or to supply materials and components that meet our quality  quantity or cost requirements  combined with a delay in our ability to obtain substitute sources for these materials and components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  would harm our ability to manufacture our products effectively  or would significantly increase our production costs  either of which could materially and adversely affect us 
in addition  we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain proprietary die cast parts  electronics  software  catalysts and engines for use in our end products 
approximately   and  of our purchases of raw materials and services during the years ended december    and  respectively  were supplied by ten entities 
during and  no suppliers represented more than of our purchases of raw materials and services

the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included herein 
overview we design  manufacture and supply alternative fuel components and systems for use in the transportation and industrial markets on a global basis 
our components and systems control the pressure and flow of gaseous alternative fuels  such as propane and natural gas used in internal combustion engines 
our products improve efficiency  enhance power output and reduce emissions by electronically sensing and regulating the proper proportion of fuel and air required by the internal combustion engine 
we also provide engineering and systems integration services to address our individual customer requirements for product performance  durability and physical configuration 
for over years  we have developed alternative fuel products 
we supply our products and systems to the market place through a global distribution network of distributors and dealers in more than countries and original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
manufacturers of industrial mobile equipment and stationary engines are among the most active customers for our industrial products 
users of small and large industrial engines capitalize on the lower cost and pollutant benefits of using alternative fuels 
for example  forklift and other industrial equipment users often use our products to operate equipment indoors resulting in lower toxic emissions 
the wide availability of gaseous fuels in world markets combined with their lower emissions and cost compared to gasoline and diesel fuels is driving rapid growth in the global alternative fuel industry 
automobile manufacturers  taxi companies  transit and shuttle bus companies  and delivery fleets are among the most active customers for our transportation products where our largest markets are currently outside the united states 
our us automotive business  through recent acquisitions  has the capabilities necessary to be a leader in this market 
we believe fuel systems is positioned to compete in the dedicated and dual fuel natural gas vehicle ngv oem market emerging in the united states 
we maintain certain key technology and industry relationships to further our north american oem and fleet market strategy 
our vehicle modification and systems integration capabilities for a variety of alternative fuel applications  including hybrid  cng  propane and dual fuel diesel present us with a unique advantage in the market 
while we have limited visibility with respect to the evolving us automotive market  we continue to believe fleet vehicles offer attractive opportunities for our gaseous fuel solutions in the us we now have a full suite of automotive capabilities in this market  including a carb certified  dedicated systems product line and in house oem systems engineering platform  enhancing our ability to leverage our existing relationships with fleet customers and other manufacturers as they roll out cng and lpg versions of key fleet vehicles 
in the first quarter of  we completed the acquisition of the net assets of the cubogas compressor division of dresser italia srl  specializing in natural gas compressors and packaging solutions  to build our infrastructure and natural gas compressor product lines and to serve the growing demand from commercial  fleet and consumer customers 
the cubogas brand acquired with the cubogas acquisition adds a new line of cng compressor and packaging products for a wide range of applications  and will enable us to maximize the scale and efficiency of the former dresser cng compressor business 

table of contents for the year ended december   revenue decreased approximately compared to the prior year  operating profit became an operating loss due to goodwill and long lived assets impairment charges in  and diluted eps went from in to a loss of in while the revenue decrease was driven primarily by the weakening of local currencies compared to the us dollar  which negatively impacted revenue by million  we experienced growth in our doem conversion volumes in italy as well as our compressor business offset by lower global aftermarket sales and lower doem conversion in the us automotive market compared to the prior year period  in local currency dollars 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized impairment charges of approximately million and million associated with goodwill and long lived assets  respectively  in our fss industrial segment  and of million and million  associated with goodwill and long lived assets  respectively  in our fss automotive segment 
in addition  we recognized a tax benefit in related to the release of a valuation allowance of million  which impacted basic and diluted eps by 
the us natural gas automotive market as well as the natural gas compressor market continues to develop at a much slower pace than we anticipated 
these markets continue to encounter challenges including political  economic and other competing technical applications 
while we continue to invest in these markets  any further weakening of these market developments would likely exacerbate the negative effects in our fss automotive business that we are experiencing 
this could significantly affect our liquidity which may cause us to defer needed capital expenditures  reduce research and development or other spending  and defer costs to achieve productivity programs or sell assets  thereby negatively impacting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  we believe that our net cash position of million  including marketable securities excluding deferred compensation plan assets  provides us with adequate capital for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include expansion of our business  additional repayment of debt and financing of future acquisitions of companies or assets 
recent developments acquisition of cubogas natural gas compressor systems on february   through our wholly owned subsidiary mtm srl mtm  we purchased from the wayne business of dresser italia srl the seller  the net assets of its cubogas compressor division the cubogas acquisition  specializing in natural gas compressors and packaging solutions  in an all cash transaction 
the acquisition enables the company to build its infrastructure and natural gas compressor product lines and to serve the growing demand from commercial  fleet and consumer customers 
the aggregate purchase price totals approximately million approximately million  of which million million was paid at closing  million million was payable in two equal installments and days after closing  and million million will be paid in three equal installments one year  two years  and three years from the closing date 
the deal includes the purchase of the cubogas trademarks  a manufacturing license for nuovo pignone vertical reciprocating compressors  and a license to use the dresser trademark in connection with the manufacture  development and distribution of former dresser cng compressor systems 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  taxes  inventories  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under 
table of contents the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies related to the following accounts or activities are those that are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the more significant judgments and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified through management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based  in part  on historical experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we believe that our warranty experience is within the industry norms 
our standard warranty period is to months from the date of delivery to the customer depending on the product 
the warranty obligation on our certified engine products can vary from three to five years depending on the specific part and the actual hours of usage 
our warranty reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding product failure rates  material usage service delivery costs 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially  either positively or negatively  impact our gross profit and operating profit 
inventory reserves we write down our inventory for estimated slow moving and obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in addition  we examine current and future product sale turnover to determine if there is slow moving inventory 
our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including historical results  future demand and market conditions as well as current inventory loss trends 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
in those acquisitions that include contingent consideration ie earnout payments to be paid upon the satisfaction of certain milestones as part of the total consideration paid  we determine the fair value of this liability at the acquisition date using a probability weighted income approach 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding 
table of contents offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and they are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies and patents and other customer contracts  the life of the acquired developed technologies and patents  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  risk associated with uncertainty  achievement and payment of any milestones  the life of the acquired developed technologies and patents  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in addition  uncertain tax positions assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly  with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values 
subsequent to the measurement period  our final determination of the uncertain tax positions estimated value  or tax related valuation allowances  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
goodwill impairment assessments goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter  after the annual forecasting process is completed 
furthermore  goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
each interim period  management assesses whether or not an indicator of impairment is present that would necessitate that a goodwill impairment analysis be performed in an interim period other than during the fourth quarter 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a three step process  with an optional under certain circumstances qualitative analysis  known as step  based on relevant event and circumstances that may be performed ahead of such two steps to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if step passes  the two steps impairment process is not required 
if step fails  the two steps process analysis is required 
step one compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  
table of contents step two is performed  where the reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  impairment exists and must be recognized 
management reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units are identified in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
as of the current annual impairment date we had eight reporting units 
we prepare our goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit  determined using an income approach  with its carrying value 
the carrying value of a reporting unit is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
the income approach requires several assumptions including future sales growth  ebit earnings before interest and taxes margins  and capital expenditures 
our reporting units each provide their forecast of results for the next five years 
these forecasts are the basis for the information used in the discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow model also requires the use of a discount rate and a terminal revenue growth rate the revenue growth rate for the period beyond the five years forecasted by the reporting units  as well as projections of future gross and operating margins for the period beyond the forecasted five years 
during the fourth quarter of  management used discount rates ranging from to and terminal growth rates ranging from the differences in discount rates and terminal growth rates reflect considerations about differences in the underlying businesses  as well as local economic conditions environments 
the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc fair value measurements and disclosures 
as a result of the goodwill impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge of million to fully impair the goodwill balance of our us automotive reporting unit  as well as an impairment charge of million against the original amount of our afs reporting unit goodwill of million 
these impairment charges were included as a separate component of operating income for the year ended december  as a result  as of december   we had million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet see note impairments in this form k for the year ended december  for carrying amount of goodwill by segments 
the fair values of our remaining reporting units exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately to as high as 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in two additional reporting units failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis  which would have required the completion of step two of the goodwill impairment analysis to arrive at a potential goodwill impairment loss for those reporting units 
the goodwill at risk associated with these reporting units is approximately million as of october  a basis point decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in an additional reporting unit failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis  which would have required the completion of step two of the goodwill impairment analysis to arrive at a potential goodwill impairment loss for that reporting unit 
the goodwill at risk associated with this reporting unit is approximately million as of october  long lived assets impairment assessments we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets and equipments and leasehold improvements whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
we consider several indicators of impairment  among which a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business 
table of contents climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group  a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
undiscounted cash flows are estimated through several assumptions including future sales growth  ebit earnings before interest and taxes margins  and capital expenditures 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
in the fourth quarter of  we found an indicator of possible impairment of long lived assets in the operating and cash flow trends  both current and forecasted  which were evidenced by the goodwill impairment analysis in two of our reporting units discussed above 
in its analysis  management determined that the lowest level asset group  for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities  is represented by each respective reporting unit 
our recoverability test included some of the same assumptions used in the goodwill impairment tests  with additional considerations to determine future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
considerations on terminal value  adjusted to exclude growth beyond the existing service potential of the asset group  were also factored in under both a growth model and a multiple of earnings scenarios 
the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc fair value measurements and disclosures 
as a result of the long lived assets impairment analysis  we recognized impairment charges of approximately million and of million against the carrying values of our us automotive reporting unit intangibles and equipment and leasehold improvements  respectively  as well as an impairment charge of approximately million against the carrying value of our afs reporting unit intangibles 
these impairment charges were included as a separate component of operating income for the year ended december  as a result  as of december   we had million of intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet see note impairments in this form k for the year ended december  for carrying amount of intangibles by segments 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million in cost of goods sold in fiscal associated with the relocation of our automotive operations in the netherlands and did not recognize any such impairment charges in deferred taxes based upon the substantial net operating loss carryforwards and recent history of losses incurred in certain jurisdictions  we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions as of december  will be realized within the foreseeable future 
the balance of the total united states valuation allowance was approximately million as of december  in addition  we have a foreign valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  we 
table of contents expect to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits generated in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets 
as of december   undistributed earnings  except with respect to a portion of undistributed earnings from mtm  are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for united states federal and state income taxes is provided thereon 
residual us taxes have been accrued applied as a reduction of net operating loss carryforwards on approximately million of earnings of mtm that is not considered indefinitely reinvested 
such amounts could be drawn as a dividend from mtm in the future without us income tax consequences 
upon distributions of earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
we have accrued such residual income taxes for all undistributed foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
it is not practical to determine the income tax impact in the event we repatriate undistributed foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested 
as of december   approximately million in foreign withholding taxes was accrued related to undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 
we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
results of operations in an effort to more appropriately align the structure and business activities within fuel systems into two operating segments  starting in the second quarter of  management reorganized operations into the following segments fss automotive and fss industrial 
fss automotive consists of our passenger and light duty commercial transportation  automotive oem and aftermarket  and transportation infrastructure operations  as well as the us automotive unit 
fss industrial consists of our industrial mobile and stationary equipment and auxiliary power unit apu  and the heavy duty commercial transportation operations

the overall revenue for the group is relatively unchanged when compared with the prior year 
there was a small decrease of approximately million for our industrial products produced in canada and europe  which were almost entirely offset by a slight increase in our apu business of approximately million 
included in the results discussed above is the weakening of local currencies compared to the us dollar which negatively impacted revenues by approximately million for the year ended december  
table of contents fss automotive 
the decrease in revenue was due primarily to the weakening of local currencies compared to the us dollar which negatively impacted revenue by million 
on a constant currency basis  our compressor sales increased approximately million  of which million related to our cubogas acquisition  and our total doem conversions decreased million compared to the prior year although our conversions were higher in italy offset by lower us conversions 
our aftermarket and oem kit sales decreased in the us as well as internationally asia and pacific rim by approximately million 
we continue to expect quarterly revenue from the us automotive market to be closely tied to orders from oems and  as a result  significant fluctuations may occur period to period 
in addition  we expect the negative economic conditions in europe to continue to place pressure on our aftermarket sales in europe

the increase includes higher product costs primarily associated with the higher volumes in the auxiliary power unit business as well as higher overall overhead costs for the segment 
included in the results discussed above is the weakening of local currencies compared to the us dollar which negatively impacted cost of sales by approximately million for the year ended december  our gross margins for fss industrial decreased compared to the prior year due to increased competitive pressures 
we expect the pressure on fss industrial gross margins to continue in the near term 
fss automotive 
the decrease was due primarily to the weakening of local currencies compared to the us dollar which decreased cost of revenue by approximately million 
on a constant currency basis  the primary decrease in the cost of revenue relates to the decrease in doem volume in the us  due to the completion of a large order in the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by higher material costs related to increased compressor and doem volumes in italy  higher labor and overhead costs as well as higher inventory write downs compared to the prior year 
our gross margins for fss automotive increased slightly compared to the prior year due to higher doem conversion volumes in italy offset by lower volumes in the us market as well as higher compressor volumes 
we expect the pressure on fss automotive gross margins to continue until volumes associated with the us automotive market increase  which will better absorb fixed costs

liquidity and capital resources amounts in the tables in thousands overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and debt financing 
additionally from time to time we raise funds from the equity capital markets to fund our working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include expansion of our business  additional repayment of debt and 
table of contents financing of future acquisitions of companies or assets 
we believe the amounts available to us under our various credit agreements together with cash on hand will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital and other cash needs for worldwide operations for at least the next months 
for periods beyond months  although we do not have any plans to do so  we may seek additional financing to fund future operations through future offerings of equity or debt securities or through agreements with corporate partners with respect to the development of our technologies and products 
however  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements will substantially depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by prevailing economic conditions  and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we continue to evaluate our need to increase liquidity 
we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions

in june  our fss automotive segment purchased approximately an additional million of prime rated german government bonds with a maturity date of march  these investments were placed in the available for sale category

although we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds  residual us taxes have been accrued on approximately million of earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested from our international subsidiaries 
we expect existing domestic and foreign cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities  such as regular material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically  for example to fund significant discretionary activities  such as acquisitions of businesses  we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions 
this could result in higher effective tax rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency management 
we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuations related to the manufacture  assemble and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar 
the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union  argentina  australia and canada 
movements in currency exchange rates may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flow associated with our foreign operations as well as the translation of the net asset or liability positions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
in countries outside of the united states  we generally generate revenues and incur operating expenses denominated in local currencies 
these revenue and expenses are translated using the average rates during the period in which they are recognized and are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates 
we monitor this risk and attempt to minimize the exposure to our net results through the management of cash disbursements in local currencies 
we prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed a uniform movement in currencies by relative to the us dollar on our results 
based upon the results of these analyses  a change in currency rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our earnings for the year ended december  by approximately million 
we seek to hedge our foreign currency economic risk by minimizing our us dollar investment in foreign operations using foreign currency term loans to finance our foreign subsidiaries 
the term loans are denominated in local currencies and translated to us dollars at period end exchange rates
