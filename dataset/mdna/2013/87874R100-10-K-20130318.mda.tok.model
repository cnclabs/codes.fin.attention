table of contents years ended december  in thousands net income loss interest and other income  net provision for benefit from income taxes depreciation amortization of intangible assets amortization of purchase price adjustment for earnouts ebitda stock based compensation restructuring charge adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management when reviewing our performance 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest and other income expense net  provision for benefit from income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as further adjusted to exclude stock based compensation and restructuring charges 
we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets affecting relative depreciation expense  acquisition related charges such as amortization of intangible assets and earnouts and the impact of non cash stock based compensation expense costs 
because adjusted ebitda facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use adjusted ebitda in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda in connection with our compensation of our executive officers and senior management 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  operating income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
we understand that although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of companies  adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

sources of revenues we sell advertising programs to it vendors targeting a specific audience within a particular it sector or sub sector 
we maintain multiple points of contact with our customers to provide support throughout their organizations and the sales cycle

there are multiple factors that can impact our customers advertising objectives and spending with us  including but not limited to  product launches  increases or decreases to their advertising budgets  the timing of key industry marketing events  responses to competitor activities and efforts to address specific marketing objectives such as creating brand awareness or generating sales leads 
our services are generally delivered under short term contracts that run for the length of a given advertising program  typically less than six months 
the majority of our revenue is derived from the delivery of our online offerings from our media groups 
online revenue represented  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively

our lead generation offerings include the activity intelligence dashboard  a new technology platform that gives techtarget s customer s marketers and sales representatives a real time view of their prospects  which includes insights on the research activities of technology buying teams  including at an account level 
lead generation offerings may also include an additional service  nurture notify  which helps both technology marketers and their sales teams to identify highly active prospects  detect emerging projects  retarget interested buying teams  and accelerate engagement with specific accounts 
our lead generation offerings may also include the syndication of the following white papers 
white papers are technical documents created by it vendors to describe business or technical problems which are addressed by the vendors products or services 
as part of a lead generation campaign  we post white papers on our relevant websites and our users receive targeted promotions about these content assets 
prior to viewing white papers  our registered members and visitors supply their corporate contact information and agree to receive further information from the vendor 
the corporate contact and other qualification information for these leads are supplied to the vendor in real time through our proprietary lead management software 
webcasts  podcasts  videocasts and virtual trade shows 
webcasts  podcasts  videocasts  virtual trade shows and similar content bring informational sessions directly to attendees desktops and  in the case of podcasts  directly to their mobile devices 
as is the case with white papers  our users supply their corporate contact and qualification information to the webcast  podcast  virtual trade show or videocast sponsor when they view or download the content 
sponsorship includes access to the registrant information and visibility before  during and after the event 
our branding offerings provide it vendors exposure to targeted audiences of it professionals actively researching information related to their products and services and include display advertising and custom offerings 
display advertising can be purchased on specific websites within our network and against specific technology segments 
these offerings give it vendors the ability to increase their brand awareness to highly specialized it sectors 
our other offerings include the following custom content creation

these content assets are then promoted to our audience in the context of the advertisers lead generation programs 
our custom offerings allow customers to have content or entire microsites created that focus on topics related to their marketing objectives and include promotion of these vehicles to our users 
content sponsorships 
it vendors pay us to sponsor editorially created content vehicles on specific technology topics  such as e zines  e books  and e guides 
in some cases  these vehicles are supported by multiple sponsors in a single segment  with the registrant information provided to all participating sponsors 
because these offerings are editorially driven  advertisers get the benefit of association with independently created content  and access to qualified sales leads that are researching the topic 
list rentals 
we also offer it vendors the ability to message relevant registered members on topics related to their interests 
it vendors can rent our e mail and postal lists of registered members using specific criteria such as company size  geography or job title 
third party revenue sharing arrangements 
we have arrangements with certain third parties  including for the licensing of our online content  for the renting of our database of opted in e mail subscribers and for which advertising from customers of certain third parties is made available to our website visitors 
in each of these arrangements we are paid a share of the resulting revenue 
events 
events revenue represented  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
most of our media groups operate revenue generating events 
the majority of our events are free to it professionals and are sponsored by it vendors 
attendees are pre screened based on event specific criteria such as sector specific budget size  company 
table of contents size  or job title 
we offer three types of events multi day conferences  single day seminars and custom events 
multi day conferences provide independent expert content for our attendees and allow vendors to purchase exhibit space and other sponsorship offerings that enable interaction with the attendees 
we also hold single day seminars on various topics in major cities 
these seminars provide independent content on key sub topics in the sectors we serve  are free to qualified attendees  and offer multiple vendors the ability to interact with specific  targeted audiences actively focused on buying decisions 
our custom events differ from our seminars in that they are exclusively sponsored by a single it vendor  and the content is driven primarily by the sole sponsor

personnel related costs are a significant component of most of these expense categories except for depreciation and amortization

selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  sales commissions  travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  stock based compensation expenses  facilities and related overhead 
sales commissions are recorded as expense when earned by the employee  based on recorded revenue 
product development 
product development expense includes the creation and maintenance of our network of websites  advertiser offerings and technical infrastructure 
product development expense consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  stock based compensation expenses  facilities and other related overhead 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  facilities expenses  accounting  legal and other professional fees  and stock based compensation expenses 
depreciation 
depreciation expense consists of the depreciation of our property and equipment 
depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from two to ten years 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets expense consists of the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to ten years  using methods that are expected to reflect the estimated pattern of economic use 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges consist of employee severance and associated termination costs 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments less any interest expense incurred 
we historically have invested our cash in money market accounts  municipal bonds and government agency bonds 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue  long lived assets  goodwill  the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  earnouts  self insurance accruals and income taxes 
we based our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information about these critical accounting policies as well as a description of our other accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of targeted advertising campaigns which we deliver via our network of websites and events 
in all cases  we recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the majority of our online media sales involve multiple product offerings 
although each of our online media offerings can be sold separately  most of our online media sales involve multiple online offerings 
because objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements in our bundled product offerings  we use a best estimate of selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of fair value 
we establish best estimates considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  class of client  size of transaction  available media inventory  pricing strategies and market conditions 
we believe the use of the best estimate of selling price allows revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction 
we apply a relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
revenue is then recognized as delivery occurs 
we evaluate all deliverables of an arrangement at inception and each time an item is delivered  to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
based on this evaluation  the arrangement consideration is measured and allocated to each of these elements 
online media 
revenue for lead generation campaigns is recognized as follows beginning in the period ended march   our lead generation campaigns all offer the activity intelligence dashboard 
in order to manage the lead generation component of the campaigns such as white papers  webcasts  podcasts  videocasts and virtual trade shows  we have changed our operational approach and the contractual terms and conditions under which we sell our products 
instead of contracting to sell individual elements of such campaigns  we sell various lead generation campaigns through the dashboard 
accordingly  revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of the campaigns  which is typically less than six months 
lead generation offerings may also include an additional service  nurture notify  in which case revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the campaign as a combined unit of accounting 
as part of these offerings  we guarantee a minimum number of qualified leads to be delivered over the course of the advertising campaign 
we determine the content necessary to achieve performance guarantees 
scheduled end dates of advertising campaigns sometimes need to be extended  pursuant to the terms of the arrangement  to satisfy lead guarantee obligations 
we estimate a revenue reserve necessary to adjust revenue recognition for extended advertising campaigns 
these estimates are based on our experience in managing and fulfilling these offerings 
the customer has cancellation privileges which generally require advance notice by the customer and require proportional payment by the customer for the portion of the campaign period that has been provided 
additionally  we offer sales incentives to certain customers  primarily in the form of volume rebates  which are classified as a reduction of revenues and are calculated based on the terms of the specific customer s contract 
we accrue for these sales incentives based on contractual terms and historical experience 
in  revenue for elements of lead generation campaigns was recognized as follows white papers 
white paper revenue was recognized ratably over the period in which the white paper was available on our websites 
webcasts  podcasts  videocasts and virtual trade shows 
webcast  podcast  videocast  virtual trade show and similar content revenue was recognized ratably over the period in which the webcast  podcast  videocast or virtual trade show was available on our websites 
revenue for other online media offerings is recognized as follows for as well as custom content creation 
custom content revenue is recognized when the creation is completed and delivered to the customer  with the exception of microsites which are recognized over the period during which they are live 

table of contents content sponsorships 
content sponsorship revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which the related content vehicle is available on our websites 
list rentals 
list rental revenue is recognized in the period in which the list is sent to our customers 
banners 
banner revenue is recognized in the period in which the banner impressions or clicks occur 
third party revenue sharing arrangements 
revenue from third party revenue sharing arrangements is recognized on a net basis in the period in which the services are performed 
for certain third party agreements where we are the primary obligor  revenue is recognized on a gross basis in the period in which the services are performed 
we recognize revenue from cost per lead advertising in the period during which the leads are delivered  which is typically less than six months 
during fiscal and prior  because objective evidence of fair value did not exist for all elements in our bundled advertising campaigns  no allocation could be made among the various elements  so we recognized revenue as one unit of accounting ratably over the term of the arrangement 
event sponsorships 
we recognize sponsorship revenue from events in the period in which the event occurs 
the majority of our events are free to qualified attendees  however  certain events are based on a paid attendee model 
we recognize revenue for paid attendee events upon completion of the event 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  capitalized software  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets have arisen principally from our acquisitions 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible assets using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to ten years  using methods of amortization that are expected to reflect the estimated pattern of economic use 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually  and whenever indicators of impairment are present  using a discounted cash flow approach to fair value determinations 
fair value of financial instruments financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable and contingent consideration 
the carrying value of these instruments approximates their estimated fair values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we offset gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any write offs of accounts receivable significantly different than the amounts reserved 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize stock based compensation in our results of operations using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award or using the accelerated method if the award is contingent upon performance goals 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
we calculated the fair values of the options granted using the following estimated weighted average assumptions years ended december  expected volatility expected term years years years risk free interest rate expected dividend yield weighted average grant date fair value per share as there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering in may  and there has been limited historical information on the volatility of our common stock since the date of our initial public offering  we determine the volatility for options granted based on an analysis of the historical volatility of our stock and reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using a weighted average of the historical volatility of our stock and the peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate based on our historical forfeiture experience of  and in determining the expense recorded in the years ended december   and  respectively 
internal use software and website development costs we capitalize costs of materials  consultants and compensation and related expenses of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software and website applications and infrastructure involving developing software to operate our websites 
however  we expense as incurred website development costs for new features and functionalities since it is not probable that they will result in additional functionality until they are both developed and tested with confirmation that they are more effective than the current set of features and functionalities on our websites 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the state at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  which is generally three years 
to the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our websites  assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  the amount of website development costs we capitalize and amortize in future periods would be impacted 
we review capitalized internal use software and website development costs for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
we capitalized internal use software and website development costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of book to tax differences on stock based compensation  timing of deductions for deferred rent and accrued expenses  and net operating loss nol carryforwards 
as of december   we had state nol carryforwards of approximately million  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
the nol carryforwards expire through we also have foreign nol carryforwards of million  which may be used to offset future taxable income in foreign jurisdictions until they expire  through 
table of contents net income loss per share we calculate basic earnings per share eps by dividing earnings available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares and vested  undelivered restricted stock awards 
because the holders of unvested restricted stock awards do not have nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  we do not consider these awards to be participating securities that should be included in our computation of earnings per share under the two class method 
diluted eps is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and vested  undelivered restricted stock awards during the period  plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method 
in calculating diluted eps  the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock awards is computed using the average market price for the respective period 
in addition  the assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the average unrecognized compensation expense and assumed tax benefit of stock options and restricted stock awards that are in the money 
this results in the assumed buyback of additional shares  thereby reducing the dilutive impact of stock options

we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments  our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the operations of our existing business  our potential strategic expansion internationally  future acquisitions we might undertake  and the expansion into complementary businesses 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents  investments and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings

dso was days at december   and days at both december  and certain categories of our customers may pay at a slower rate and  therefore  cause our dso to increase 
the increase in dso year over year is primarily the result of a larger percentage of annual billings being made in the fourth quarter to this group of customers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk we currently have subsidiaries in london  england  hong kong  australia  singapore  and paris  france 
additionally  we have a wholly foreign owned enterprise formed under the laws of the people s republic of china  a vie in beijing  prc and an office in india 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from advertisers located outside of north america and our foreign exchange gains losses were not significant 
we currently believe our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is financially immaterial and therefore have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency futures or options in the future 
interest rate risk at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market accounts  municipal bonds and government agency bonds 
the cash  cash equivalents and investments were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the amount of interest expense we must pay under our revolving credit facility 
the advances under this credit facility bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the lender s prime rate or libor 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility
