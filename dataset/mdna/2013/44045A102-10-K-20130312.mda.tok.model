item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information about the credit facilities and the senior notes 
in addition  we may issue additional debt securities or preferred stock in one or more series in the future 
market opportunity we focus our investments primarily in four key industries of the emerging technology market technology  life science  healthcare information and services and cleantech 
the technology sectors we focus on include communications  networking  wireless communications  data storage  software  cloud computing  semiconductor  internet and media  and consumer related technologies 
the life science sectors we focus on include biotechnology  drug delivery  bioinformatics and medical devices 
the healthcare information and services sectors we focus on include diagnostics  medical record services and software and other healthcare related services and technologies that improve efficiency and quality of administered healthcare 
the cleantech sectors we focus on include alternative energy  water purification  energy efficiency  green building materials and waste recycling 
we believe that venture lending has the potential to achieve enhanced returns that are attractive notwithstanding the high degree of risk associated with lending to development stage companies 
potential benefits include interest rates that typically exceed rates that would be available to portfolio companies if they could borrow in traditional commercial financing transactions  the loan support provided by cash proceeds from equity capital invested by venture capital and private equity firms  relatively rapid amortization of loans  senior ranking to equity and collateralization of loans to minimize potential loss of capital  and potential equity appreciation through warrants 
we believe that venture lending also provides an attractive financing source for portfolio companies  their management teams and their equity capital investors  as it is typically less dilutive to the equity holders than additional equity financing  extends the time period during which a portfolio company can operate before seeking additional equity capital or pursuing a sale transaction or other liquidity event  and allows portfolio companies to better match cash sources with uses 
competitive strengths we believe that we  together with our advisor  possess significant competitive strengths  including consistently execute commitments and close transactions 
our advisor and its senior management and investment professionals have an extensive track record of originating  underwriting and closing venture loans 
our advisor has directly originated  underwritten and managed more than venture loans with an aggregate original principal amount over million since it commenced operations in in our experience  prospective portfolio companies prefer lenders that have a demonstrated ability to deliver on their commitments 
robust direct origination capabilities 
our advisor s managing directors each have significant experience originating venture loans in our target industries 
this experience has given each managing director a deep knowledge of our target industries and an extensive base of transaction sources and references 
our advisor s brand name recognition in our market has resulted in a steady flow of high quality investment opportunities that are consistent with the strategic vision and expectations of our advisor s senior management 
highly experienced and cohesive management team 
our advisor has had the same senior management team of experienced professionals since its inception 
this consistency allows companies  their management teams and their investors to rely on consistent and predictable service  loan products and terms and underwriting standards 
relationships with venture capital and private equity investors 
our advisor has developed strong relationships with venture capital and private equity firms and their partners 
the strength and breadth of our advisor s venture capital and private equity relationships would take other firms considerable time and expense to develop and we believe this represents a significant barrier to entry 
well known brand name 
our advisor has originated venture loans to more than companies in our target industries under the horizon technology finance brand 
we believe that the horizon technology finance brand as a competent  knowledgeable and active participant in the venture lending marketplace will continue to result in a significant number of referrals and prospective investment opportunities in our target industries 
competition we compete for investments with a number of investment funds and other bdcs  as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other financing sources 
some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
we believe we compete effectively with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience  industry knowledge and contacts of our advisor s investment professionals  its responsiveness and efficient investment analysis and decision making processes  its creative financing products and highly customized investment terms 
we do not intend to compete primarily on the interest rates we offer and believe that some competitors make loans with rates that are comparable to or lower than our rates 
for additional information concerning the competitive risks see item a risk factors risks related to our business and structure we operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities  and if we are not able to compete effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected and the value of your investment in us could decline 
investment criteria we make investments in companies that are diversified by their stage of development  their target industries and sectors of target industries and their geographical location  as well as by the venture capital and private equity sponsors that support our portfolio companies 
while we invest in companies at various stages of development  we require that prospective portfolio companies be beyond the seed stage of development and have received at least their first round of venture capital or private equity financing before we will consider making an investment 
we expect a prospective portfolio company to demonstrate its ability to advance technology and increase its value over time 
we have identified several criteria that we believe have proven  and will prove  important in achieving our investment objective 
these criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions 
however  we caution you that not all of these criteria are met by each portfolio company in which we choose to invest 
management 
our portfolio companies are generally led by experienced management that has in market expertise in the target industry in which the company operates  as well as extensive experience with development stage companies 
the adequacy and completeness of the management team is assessed relative to the stage of development and the challenges facing the potential portfolio company 
continuing support from one or more venture capital and private equity investors 
we typically invest in companies in which one or more established venture capital and private equity investors have previously invested and continue to make a contribution to the management of the business 
we believe that established venture capital and private equity investors can serve as a committed partner and will assist their portfolio companies and their management teams in creating value 
we take into consideration the total amount raised by the company  the valuation history  investor reserves for future investment and the expected timing and milestones to the next equity round financing 
operating plan and cash resources 
we generally require that a prospective portfolio company  in addition to having sufficient access to capital to support leverage  demonstrate an operating plan capable of generating cash flows or the ability to raise the additional capital necessary to cover its operating expenses and service its debt 
our review of the operating plan will take into consideration existing cash  cash burn  cash runway and the milestones necessary for the company to achieve cash flow positive operations or to access additional equity from the investors 
enterprise and technology value 
we expect that the enterprise value of a prospective portfolio company should substantially exceed the principal balance of debt borrowed by the company 
enterprise value includes the implied valuation based upon recent equity capital invested as well as the intrinsic value of the company s particular technology  service or customer base 
market opportunity and exit strategy 
we seek portfolio companies that are addressing large market opportunities that capitalize on their competitive advantages 
competitive advantages may include a unique technology  protected intellectual property  superior clinical results or significant market traction 
as part of our investment analysis  we typically also consider potential realization of our warrants through merger  acquisition or initial public offering based upon comparable exits in the company s target industry 
investment process our board of directors board has delegated authority for all investment decisions to our advisor 
our advisor  in turn  has created an integrated approach to the loan origination  underwriting  approval and documentation process that we believe effectively combines the skills of our advisor s professionals 
this process allows our advisor to achieve an efficient and timely closing of an investment from the initial contact with a prospective portfolio company through the investment decision  close of documentation and funding of the investment  while ensuring that our advisor s rigorous underwriting standards are consistently maintained 
we believe that the high level of involvement by our advisor s staff in the various phases of the investment process allows us to minimize the credit risk while delivering superior service to our portfolio companies 
origination 
our advisor s loan origination process begins with its industry focused regional managing directors who are responsible for identifying  contacting and screening prospects 
these managing directors meet with key decision makers and deal referral sources such as venture capital and private equity firms and management teams  legal firms  accounting firms  investment banks and other lenders to source prospective portfolio companies 
we believe our brand name and management team are well known within the venture lending community  as well as by many repeat entrepreneurs and board members of prospective portfolio companies 
these broad relationships  which reach across the venture lending industry  give rise to a significant portion of our advisor s deal origination 
the responsible managing director of our advisor obtains review materials from the prospective portfolio company and from those materials  as well as other available information  determines whether it is appropriate for our advisor to issue a non binding term sheet 
the managing director bases this decision to proceed on his or her experience  the competitive environment and the prospective portfolio company s needs and also seeks the counsel of our advisor s senior management and investment team 
term sheet 
if the managing director determines  after review and consultation with senior management  that the potential transaction meets our advisor s initial credit standards  our advisor will issue a non binding term sheet to the prospective portfolio company 
the terms of the transaction are tailored to a prospective portfolio company s specific funding needs while taking into consideration market dynamics  the quality of the management team  the venture capital and private equity investors involved and applicable credit criteria  which may include the prospective portfolio company s existing cash resources  the development of its technology and the anticipated timing for the next round of equity financing 
underwriting 
once the term sheet has been negotiated and executed and the prospective portfolio company has remitted a good faith deposit  we request additional due diligence materials from the prospective portfolio company and arrange for a due diligence visit 
due diligence 
the due diligence process includes a formal visit to the prospective portfolio company s location and interviews with the prospective portfolio company s senior management team including its chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief scientific or technology officer  principal marketing or sales professional and other key managers 
the process includes obtaining and analyzing information from independent third parties that have knowledge of the prospective portfolio company s business  including  to the extent available  analysts that follow the technology market  thought leaders in our target industries and important customers or partners  if any 
outside sources of information are reviewed  including industry publications  scientific and market articles  internet publications  publicly available information on competitors or competing technologies and information known to our advisor s investment team from their experience in the technology markets 
a key element of the due diligence process is interviewing key existing investors in the prospective portfolio company  who are often also members of the prospective portfolio company s board of directors 
while these board members and or investors are not independent sources of information  their support for management and willingness to support the prospective portfolio company s further development are critical elements of our decision making process 
investment memorandum 
upon completion of the due diligence process and review and analysis of all of the information provided by the prospective portfolio company and obtained externally  our advisor s assigned credit officer prepares an investment memorandum for review and approval 
the investment memorandum is reviewed by our advisor s chief credit officer and submitted to our advisor s investment committee for approval 
investment committee 
our board delegates authority for all investment decisions to our advisor s investment committee 
our advisor s investment committee is responsible for overall credit policy  portfolio management  approval of all investments  portfolio monitoring and reporting and managing of problem accounts 
the committee interacts with the entire staff of our advisor to review potential transactions and deal flow 
this interaction of cross functional members of our advisor s staff assures efficient transaction sourcing  negotiating and underwriting throughout the transaction process 
portfolio performance and current market conditions are reviewed and discussed by the investment committee on a regular basis to assure that transaction structures and terms are consistent and current 
loan closing and funding 
approved investments are documented and closed by our advisor s in house legal and loan administration staff 
loan documentation is based upon standard templates created by our advisor and is customized for each transaction to reflect the specific deal terms 
the transaction documents typically include a loan and security agreement  warrant agreement and applicable perfection documents  including uniform commercial code financing statements and  as applicable  may also include a landlord agreement  patent and trademark security grants  a subordination agreement and other standard agreements for commercial loans in the venture lending industry 
funding requires final approval by our advisor s general counsel  chief executive officer or president  chief financial officer and chief credit officer 
portfolio management and reporting 
our advisor maintains a hands on approach to maintain communication with our portfolio companies 
at least quarterly  our advisor contacts our portfolio companies for operational and financial updates by phone and performs reviews 
our advisor may contact portfolio companies deemed to have greater credit risk on a monthly basis 
our advisor requires all private companies to provide financial statements 
for public companies  our advisor typically relies on publicly reported quarterly financials 
our advisor also typically receives copies of bank and security statements  as well as any other information required to verify reported financial information 
this allows our advisor to identify any unexpected developments in the financial performance or condition of a portfolio company 
our advisor has developed a proprietary credit rating system to analyze the quality of our loans 
using this system  our advisor analyzes and then rates the credit risk within the portfolio on a monthly basis 
each portfolio company is rated on a through scale  with representing the rating for a standard level of risk 
a rating of represents an improved and better credit quality 
a rating of or represents a deteriorating credit quality and increasing risk 
newly funded investments are typically assigned a rating of  unless extraordinary circumstances require otherwise 
these investment ratings are generated internally by our advisor  and we cannot guarantee that others would assign the same ratings to our portfolio investments or similar portfolio investments 
our advisor closely monitors portfolio companies rated a or for adverse developments 
in addition  our advisor maintains regular contact with the management  board of directors and major equity holders of these portfolio companies in order to discuss strategic initiatives to correct the deterioration of the portfolio company 
the table below describes each rating level rating the portfolio company has performed in excess of our expectations at the time of initial underwriting as demonstrated by exceeding revenue milestones  clinical milestones or other operating metrics or as a result of raising capital well in excess of our underwriting assumptions 
generally the portfolio company displays one or more of the following its enterprise value greatly exceeds our loan balance  it has achieved cash flow positive operations or has sufficient cash resources to cover the remaining balance of the loan  there is strong potential for warrant gains from our warrants  and there is a high likelihood that the borrower will receive favorable future financing to support operations 
loans rated are the lowest risk profile in our portfolio and there is no expected risk of principal loss 
the portfolio company has performed to our expectations at the time of initial underwriting as demonstrated by hitting revenue milestones  clinical milestones or other operating metrics 
it has raised  or is expected to raise  capital consistent with our underwriting assumptions 
generally the portfolio company displays one or more of the following its enterprise value comfortably exceeds our loan balance  it has sufficient cash resources to operate according to its plan  it is expected to raise additional capital as needed  and there continues to be potential for warrant gains from our warrants 
all new loans are rated when approved and thereafter rated loans represent a standard risk profile  with no loss currently expected 
the portfolio company has performed below our expectations at underwriting as demonstrated by missing revenue milestones  delayed clinical progress or otherwise failing to meet projected operating metrics 
it may have raised capital in support of the poorer performance but generally on less favorable terms than originally contemplated at the time of underwriting 
generally the portfolio company displays one or more of the following its enterprise value exceeds our loan balance but at a lower multiple than originally expected  it has sufficient cash to operate according to its plan but liquidity may be tight  and it is planning to raise additional capital but there is uncertainty and the potential for warrant gains from our warrants are possible  but unlikely 
loans rated represent an increased level of risk 
while no loss is currently anticipated for a rated loan  there is potential for future loss of principal 
the portfolio company has performed well below plan as demonstrated by materially missing revenue milestones  delayed or failed clinical progress or otherwise failing to meet operating metrics 
the portfolio company has not raised sufficient capital to operate effectively or retire its debt obligation to us 
generally the portfolio company displays one or more of the following its enterprise value may not exceed our loan balance  it has insufficient cash to operate according to its plan and liquidity may be tight  and there are uncertain plans to raise additional capital or the portfolio company is being sold under distressed conditions 
there is no potential for warrant gains from our warrants 
loans rated are generally put on non accrual status and represent a high degree of risk of loss

managerial assistance as a bdc  we offer  through our advisor  and must provide upon request  managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies 
this assistance may involve monitoring the operations of the portfolio companies  participating in board of directors and management meetings  consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance 
we may receive fees for these services  though we may reimburse our advisor for its direct expenses related to providing such services on our behalf 
employees we do not have any employees 
each of our executive officers is an employee of our advisor 
our day to day investment operations are managed by our advisor

investment management agreement under the terms of our investment management agreement with our advisor the investment management agreement  our advisor determines the composition of our portfolio  the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes  identifies  evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies  and closes  monitors and administers the investments we make  including the exercise of any voting or consent rights 
our advisor s services under the investment management agreement are not exclusive  and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired 
investment advisory fees pursuant to our investment management agreement  we pay our advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee 
base management fee 
the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of our gross assets  payable monthly in arrears 
for purposes of calculating the base management fee  the term gross assets includes any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage 
incentive fee 
the incentive fee has two parts  as follows the first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter 
for this purpose  pre incentive fee net investment income means interest income  dividend income and any other income including any other fees other than fees for providing managerial assistance  such as commitment  origination  structuring  diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies accrued during the calendar quarter  minus our operating expenses for the quarter including the base management fee  expenses payable under the administration agreement and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock  but excluding the incentive fee 
pre incentive fee net investment income includes  in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as original issue discount  debt instruments with payment in kind interest and zero coupon securities  accrued income that we have not yet received in cash 
the incentive fee with respect to our pre incentive fee net income will be of the amount  if any  by which our pre incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds a which is annualized hurdle rate and a catch up provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter 
under this provision  in any calendar quarter  our advisor receives no incentive fee until our net investment income equals the hurdle rate of  but then receives  as a catch up  of our pre incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre incentive fee net investment income  if any  that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 
the effect of this provision is that  if pre incentive fee net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter  our advisor will receive of our pre incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply 
pre incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains  realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation 
because of the structure of the incentive fee  it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss 
for example  if we receive pre incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate  we pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses 
our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the base management fee 
these calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter 
the following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income related portion of the incentive fee quarterly incentive fee based on net investment income pre incentive fee net investment income expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets 
tpgjpg 
percentage of pre incentive fee net investment income allocated to first part of incentive fee the second part of the incentive fee will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year or upon termination of the investment management agreement  as of the termination date  and will equal of our realized capital gains  if any  on a cumulative basis from the date of our election to be a bdc  through the end of each calendar year  computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis  less all previous amounts paid in respect of the capital gain incentive fee

there is no guarantee that positive returns will be realized and actual returns may vary from those shown in this example 
as illustrated in year of alternative above  if we were to be wound up on a date other than its fiscal year end of any year  we may have paid aggregate capital gains incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if we had been wound up on its fiscal year end of such year

the principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities  which issuer subject to certain limited exceptions is an eligible portfolio company  or from any person who is  or has been during the preceding months  an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company  or from any other person  subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the sec 
an eligible portfolio company is defined in the act as any issuer which is organized under the laws of  and has its principal place of business in  the united states  is not an investment company other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the bdc or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the act  and satisfies any of the following has a market capitalization of less than million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange  is controlled by a bdc or a group of companies including a bdc  the bdc actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company  and  as a result thereof  the bdc has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company  or is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than million and capital and surplus of not less than million 
securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control 
securities purchased in a private transaction from a us issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer  or in transactions incident thereto  if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer  immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements 
securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company 
securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above  or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities 
cash  cash equivalents  us government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment 
the regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time 
we may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and or take advantage of any regulatory  legislative  administrative or judicial actions in this area 
managerial assistance to portfolio companies a bdc must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the united states and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in qualifying assets above 
however  in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the test  the bdc must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities other than small and solvent companies described above significant managerial assistance 
where the bdc purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together  the bdc will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance 
making available managerial assistance means  among other things  any arrangement whereby the bdc  through its directors  officers or employees  offers to provide  and  if accepted  does so provide  significant guidance and counsel concerning the management  operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company 
issuance of additional shares we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value nav per share 
we may  however  issue and sell our common stock  at a price below the current nav of the common stock  or issue and sell warrants  options or rights to acquire such common stock  at a price below the current nav of the common stock if our board determines that such sale is in our best interest and in the best interests of our stockholders  and our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding months 
in any such case  the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which  in the determination of our board  closely approximates the market value of such securities 
temporary investments pending investment in other types of qualifying assets  as described above  our investments may consist of cash  cash equivalents  us government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment  which we refer to  collectively  as temporary investments  so that of our assets are qualifying assets 
typically  we invest in money market funds  highly rated commercial paper  us government agency notes  us treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the us government or its agencies 
a repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor  such as us  of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed upon interest rate 
there is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements 
however  subject to certain exceptions  if more than of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty  we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a ric for federal income tax purposes 
thus  we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit 
our advisor monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions 
senior securities  derivative securities we are permitted  under specified conditions  to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage  as defined in the act  is at least equal to immediately after each such issuance 
in addition  while any senior securities are outstanding  we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase 
we may also borrow amounts up to of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage 
for a discussion of the risks associated with leverage  see item a risk factors risks related to our business and structure we will borrow money  which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us 
the act also limits the amount of warrants  options and rights to common stock that we may issue and the terms of such securities 
code of ethics we and our advisor have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to rule j under the act and rule a under the advisers act  respectively  that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions 
personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts  including securities that may be purchased or held by us  so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code s requirements 
each code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to this annual report on form k  and is available on the sec s internet site at http www

the proxy voting policies and procedures of our advisor are set forth below 
the guidelines are reviewed periodically by our advisor and our independent directors and  accordingly  are subject to change 
introduction our advisor is registered with the sec as an investment adviser under the advisers act 
as an investment adviser registered under the advisers act  our advisor has fiduciary duties to us 
as part of this duty  our advisor recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders 
our advisor s proxy voting policies and procedures have been formulated to ensure decision making is consistent with these fiduciary duties 
these policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with section of  and rule under  the advisers act 
proxy policies our advisor votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what our advisor perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders 
our advisor reviews on a case by case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities held by us 
although our advisor generally votes against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities  our advisor may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long term reasons to do so 
our advisor s proxy voting decisions are made by those senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments 
to ensure that a vote is not the product of a conflict of interest  our advisor requires that anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties 
proxy voting records you may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to chief compliance officer  horizon technology finance corporation  farmington avenue  farmington  connecticut sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act  imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders 
many of these requirements affect us 
for example pursuant to rule a under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports  pursuant to item under regulation s k  our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  pursuant to rule a under the exchange act  our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting  which must be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm  and pursuant to item of regulation s k and rule a under the exchange act  our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation  including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses 
the sarbanes oxley act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the sarbanes oxley act and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
we will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations under the sarbanes oxley act and intend to take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith 
nasdaq global select market corporate governance regulations the nasdaq global select market has adopted corporate governance regulations with which listed companies must comply with 
we intend to be in compliance with these corporate governance listing standards 
we intend to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and to take all necessary actions to ensure that we are in compliance therewith 
privacy principles we are committed to maintaining the privacy of stockholders and to safeguarding our non public personal information 
the following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect  how we protect that information and why  in certain cases  we may share information with select other parties 
generally  we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders  although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us 
we do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders  except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts for example  to a transfer agent or third party administrator 
we restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to our advisor s employees with a legitimate business need for the information 
we maintain physical  electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders 
election to be taxed as a ric we have elected to be taxed  and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be taxed  as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
to maintain ric tax benefits  we must  among other requirements  meet certain source of income and quarterly asset diversification requirements as described below 
we also must annually distribute dividends of at least of the sum of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains ie net short term capital gains in excess of net long term losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution  which we refer to as the annual distribution requirement 
although not required for us to maintain our ric tax status  in order to preclude the imposition of a nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on rics  we may distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gain net income for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years the excise tax avoidance requirement 
in addition  although we may distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may decide to retain such net capital gains or ordinary income to provide us with additional liquidity 
in order to qualify as a ric for federal income tax purposes under section a of the code  we must maintain an election to be treated as a bdc under the act at all times during each taxable year  meet any applicable securities law requirements  including capital structure requirements  derive in each taxable year at least of our gross income from distributions  interest  payments with respect to certain securities loans  gains from the sale of stock or other securities  net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities  and diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year at least of the value of our assets consists of cash  cash equivalents  us government securities  securities of other rics  and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer neither represent more than of the value of our assets nor more than of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer  and no more than of the value of our assets is invested in the securities  other than us government securities or securities of other rics  of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled  as determined under applicable tax rules  by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in certain qualified publicly traded partnerships the diversification tests 
taxation as a ric if we qualify as a ric under section a of the code  and satisfy the annual distribution requirement  then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain ie  realized net long term capital gains in excess of realized net short term capital losses we distribute to stockholders 
we will be subject to us federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed or deemed distributed to our stockholders 
we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash 
for example  if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount such as debt instruments with pay in kind interest or  in certain cases  increasing interest rates or issued with warrants  we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation  regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year 
because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual  we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement  even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount 
gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss 
such gain or loss generally will be long term or short term  depending on how long we held a particular warrant 
although we do not presently expect to do so  we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements 
however  under the act  we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage tests are met 
moreover  our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by the illiquid nature of our portfolio and or other requirements relating to our status as a ric  including the diversification tests 
if we dispose of assets in order to meet the annual distribution requirement or the excise tax avoidance requirement  we may make such dispositions at times that  from an investment standpoint  are not advantageous 
failure to qualify as a ric if we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or fail to qualify as a ric in any taxable year  assuming we do not qualify for or take advantage of certain remedial provisions  we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income  regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders 
in that case  all of our income will be subject to corporate level federal income tax  reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders 
in contrast  assuming we qualify as a ric  our corporate level federal income tax liability should be substantially reduced or eliminated 
see election to be taxed as a ric above 
if we are unable to maintain our status as a ric  we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders  nor would they be required to be made 
distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary distribution income eligible for the or maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
subject to certain limitations under the code  dividends paid by us to corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s tax basis in our common stock  and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain 
item a 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  you should consider carefully the following information before making an investment in our securities 
the risks set out below are not the only risks we face 
if any of the following events occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  our nav and the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
risks related to our business and structure we have a limited operating history and may not be able to achieve our investment objective or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and your investment in us could decline substantially 
we commenced operations in march and became a public company on october  as a result of our limited operating history  we are subject to certain business risks and uncertainties associated with any recently formed business enterprise  including the risk that we will not achieve our investment objective and that the value of your investment in us could decline substantially 
as a public company  we are subject to the regulatory requirements of the sec  in addition to the specific regulatory requirements applicable to bdcs under the act and rics under the code 
our management and our advisor have limited experience operating under this regulatory framework  and we may incur substantial additional costs  and expend significant time or other resources  to do so 
from time to time our advisor may pursue investment opportunities  like equity investments  in which our advisor has more limited experience 
in addition  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from our operations to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders 
we and our advisor have limited experience operating under the constraints imposed on a bdc or managing an investment company  which may affect our ability to manage our business and impair your ability to assess our prospects 
prior to becoming a public company in october  we did not operate as a bdc or manage an investment company under the act 
as a result  we have limited operating results under this regulatory framework that can demonstrate to you either its effect on our business or our ability to manage our business within this framework 
the act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of bdcs 
for example  bdcs are required to invest at least of their total assets in specified types of securities  primarily securities of eligible portfolio companies as defined in the act  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
see regulation in item above 
our advisor s lack of experience in managing a portfolio of assets under these constraints may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and  as a result  could impair our ability to achieve our investment objective 
furthermore  if we are unable to comply with the requirements imposed on bdcs by the act  the sec could bring an enforcement action against us and or we could be exposed to claims of private litigants 
in addition  we could be regulated as a closed end management investment company under the act  which could further decrease our operating flexibility and may prevent us from operating our business  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are dependent upon key personnel of our advisor and our advisor s ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
we depend on the members of our advisor s senior management  particularly mr 
pomeroy  our chairman and chief executive officer  and mr 
michaud  our president  as well as other key personnel for the identification  evaluation  final selection  structuring  closing and monitoring of our investments 
these employees have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan to originate venture loans in our target industries 
our future success depends on the continued service of mr 
pomeroy and mr 
michaud as well as the other senior members of our advisor s management team 
if our advisor were to lose the services of either mr 
pomeroy or mr 
michaud or any of the other senior members of our advisor s management team  we may not be able to operate our business as we expect  and our ability to compete could be harmed  either of which could cause our business  results of operations or financial condition to suffer 
in addition  if more than one of mr 
pomeroy  mr 
michaud or mr 
mathieu  our chief financial officer  cease to be actively involved in the company or our advisor  and are not replaced by individuals satisfactory to wells fargo capital finance  llc wells within ninety days  wells could  absent a waiver or cure  demand repayment of any outstanding obligations under the wells facility 
if both mr 
pomeroy and mr 
michaud cease to be employed by us  and they are not replaced by individuals satisfactory to fortress credit co llc fortress within ninety days  then fortress could  absent a waiver or cure  demand repayment of any outstanding obligations under the fortress facility 
our future success also depends  in part  on our advisor s ability to identify  attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees 
absent exemptive or other relief granted by the sec and for so long as we remain externally managed  the act prevents us from granting options to our employees and adopting a profit sharing plan  which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
if we are not successful in identifying  attracting and retaining these employees  we may not be able to operate our business as we expect 
moreover  we cannot assure you that our advisor will remain our investment advisor or that we will continue to have access to our advisor s investment professionals or its relationships 
for example  our advisor may in the future manage investment funds with investment objectives similar to ours thereby diverting the time and attention of its investment professionals that we rely on to implement our business plan 
we operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities  and if we are not able to compete effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected and the value of your investment in us could decline 
we compete for investments with a number of investment funds and other bdcs  as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other financing sources 
some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
for example  some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us 
this may enable these competitors to make commercial loans with interest rates that are comparable to  or lower than  the rates we typically offer 
we may lose prospective portfolio companies if we do not match our competitors pricing  terms and structure 
if we do match our competitors pricing  terms or structure  we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit losses 
in addition  some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments  which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments  establish more relationships than us and build their market shares 
furthermore  many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the act imposes on us as a bdc or that the code imposes on us as a ric 
if we are not able to compete effectively  we may not be able to identify and take advantage of attractive investment opportunities that we identify and may not be able to fully invest our available capital 
if this occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we borrow money  which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us 
leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique  and we intend to continue to borrow money as part of our business plan 
the use of leverage magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and  therefore  increases the risks associated with investing in us 
we borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks and other lenders 
such senior debt securities include those under the credit facilities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
lenders of senior debt securities have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders 
if the value of our assets increases  then leveraging would cause the nav attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged 
however  any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged 
this decline could adversely affect our ability to make common stock dividend payments 
in addition  because our investments may be illiquid  we may be unable to dispose of them or unable to do so at a favorable price in the event we need to do so  if we are unable to refinance any indebtedness upon maturity  and  as a result  we may suffer losses 
our ability to service any debt that we incur depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures 
moreover  as our advisor s management fee is payable to our advisor based on our gross assets  including those assets acquired through the use of leverage  our advisor may have a financial incentive to incur leverage which may not be consistent with our stockholders interests 
in addition  holders of our common stock bear the burden of any increase in our expenses  as a result of leverage  including any increase in the management fee payable to our advisor 
illustration the following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns  net of expenses 
the calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below assumed return on our portfolio net of expenses corresponding return to stockholder assumes million in total assets  million in outstanding debt  million in net assets  and an average cost of borrowed funds of at december  actual interest payments may be different 
based on our outstanding indebtedness of million as of december  and the average cost of borrowed funds of as of that date  our investment portfolio would have been required to experience an annual return of at least to cover annual interest payments on the outstanding debt 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants or restrictions in our credit facilities  make payments when due thereunder or make payments pursuant to our senior notes  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our credit facilities are secured by a lien on the assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries  horizon credit ii llc credit ii and horizon credit iii llc credit iii  which hold substantially all of our assets 
the breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions or our failure to make payments when due under the credit facilities  unless cured within the applicable grace period  would result in a default under the credit facilities that would permit the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable 
in such an event  we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness and the lenders may exercise rights available to them  including  without limitation  to the extent permitted under applicable law  the seizure of such assets without adjudication 
the credit facilities include covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of credit ii and credit iii to i make loans to  or investments in  third parties other than venture loans and warrants or other equity participation rights  ii pay dividends and distributions  iii incur additional indebtedness  iv engage in mergers or consolidations  v create liens on the collateral securing the credit facilities  vi permit additional negative pledges on such collateral  vii change the business currently conducted by them  and viii have a change of control 
the credit facilities also require credit ii  credit iii and our advisor to comply with various financial covenants  including  among other covenants  maintenance by our advisor of a minimum tangible net worth and limitations on the value of  and modifications to  the loan collateral that secures the credit facilities 
complying with these restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would help us to grow our business or are otherwise consistent with our investment objective 
these restrictions could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions  meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities  and could result in our failing to qualify as a ric resulting in our becoming subject to corporate level income tax 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our credit arrangements 
an event of default or acceleration under the credit facilities could also cause a cross default or cross acceleration of another debt instrument or contractual obligation  which would adversely impact our liquidity 
we may not be granted waivers or amendments to the credit facilities or senior notes if for any reason we are unable to comply with it  and we may not be able to refinance the credit facilities on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our senior notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have currently incurred or may incur in the future 
our senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries 
as a result  the senior notes arc effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we or our subsidiaries have currently incurred and may incur in the future or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
in any liquidation  dissolution  bankruptcy or other similar proceeding  the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors  including the holders of the senior notes 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our wells facility  and million of outstanding borrowings under our fortress facility 
our senior notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
our senior notes are obligations exclusively of horizon technology finance corporation  and not of any of our subsidiaries 
none of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the senior notes and the senior notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future 
the assets of such subsidiaries are not directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors  including holders of the senior notes 
except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries  all claims of creditors including trade creditors and holders of preferred stock  if any  of our subsidiaries have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries and therefore the claims of our creditors  including holders of the senior notes with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries 
even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries  our claims are effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims 
consequently  the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our wells facility  and million of outstanding borrowings under our fortress facility 
in addition  our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  all of which would be structurally senior to the senior notes 
the indenture under which our senior notes are issued contains limited protection for holders of our senior notes 
the indenture under which the senior notes are issued offers limited protection to holders of the senior notes 
the terms of the indenture and the senior notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries ability to engage in  or otherwise be a party to  a variety of corporate transactions  circumstances or events that could have a material adverse impact on investments in the senior notes 
in particular  the terms of the indenture and the senior notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations  including any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the senior notes  any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the senior notes to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt  indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore is structurally senior to the senior notes and securities  indebtedness or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the senior notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries  in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligation that would cause a violation of section a l a as modified by section a l of the act or any successor provisions  whether or not we continue to be subject to such provisions of the act  but giving effect  in either case  to any exemptive relief granted to us by the sec these provisions generally prohibit us from making additional borrowings  including through the issuance of additional debt or the sale of additional debt securities  unless our asset coverage  as defined in the act  equals at least after such borrowings  pay dividends on  or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the senior notes  including subordinated indebtedness  in each case other than dividends  purchases  redemptions or payments that would cause a violation of section a i as modified by section a l of the act or any successor provisions giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the sec these provisions generally prohibit us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock  or purchasing any such capital stock unless our asset coverage  as defined in the act  equals at least at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and after deducting the amount of such dividend  distribution or purchase  sell assets other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  create liens including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries or enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make investments  or create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries 
in addition  the indenture does not require us to offer to purchase the senior notes in connection with a change of control or any other event 
furthermore  the terms of the indenture and the senior notes do not protect holders of the senior notes in the event that we experience changes including significant adverse changes in our financial condition  results of operations or credit ratings  as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth  revenues  income  cash flow  or liquidity 
our ability to recapitalize  incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the senior notes may have important consequences for holders of the senior notes  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the senior notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the senior notes 
certain of our current debt instruments include more protections for their holders than the indenture and the senior notes 
in addition  other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture and the senior notes  including additional covenants and events of default 
the issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the senior notes 
an active trading market for our senior notes may not exist  which could limit your ability to sell our senior notes or affect the market price of the senior note 
the senior notes are listed on the nyse under the symbol htf 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that an active trading market tor the senior notes will exist in the future or that you will be able to sell your senior notes 
even if an active trading market does exist  the senior notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates  the market for similar securities  our credit ratings  if any  general economic conditions  our financial condition  performance and prospects and other factors 
to the extent an active trading market does not exist  the liquidity and trading price for the senior notes may be harmed 
accordingly  you may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the senior notes for an indefinite period of time 
if we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness  we may not be able to make payments on our senior notes 
any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness  including a default under the wells facility  and the fortress facility  or other indebtedness to which we may be a party that is not waived by the required lenders or holders  and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal  premium  if any  and interest on the senior notes and substantially decrease the market value of the senior notes 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal premium  if any  and interest on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants  including financial and operating covenants  in the instruments governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness 
in the event of such default  the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  the lenders under the wells facility  and the fortress facility or other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments  cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
if our operating performance declines  we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the wells facility  the fortress facility  the senior notes or other debt that we may incur in the future to avoid being in default 
if we breach our covenants under the wells facility  the fortress facility  the senior notes or other debt and seek a waiver  we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders 
if this occurs  we would be in default and our lenders or debt holders could exercise their rights as described above  and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
if we are unable to repay debt  lenders having secured obligations  including the lenders under the wells facility and the fortress facility  could proceed against the collateral securing the debt 
because the wells facility and the fortress facility have  and any future credit facilities will likely have  customary cross default provisions  if the indebtedness thereunder or under any future credit facility is accelerated  we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due 
the impact of recent financial reform legislation on us is uncertain 
in light of current conditions in the us and global financial markets and the us and global economy  legislators  the presidential administration and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act institutes a wide range of reforms that will have an impact on all financial institutions 
many of these provisions are subject to rule making procedures and studies that will be conducted in the future 
accordingly  we cannot predict the effect it or its implementing regulations will have on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
because we distribute all or substantially all of our income and any realized net short term capital gains over realized net long term capital losses to our stockholders  we will need additional capital to finance our growth  if any 
if additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired 
to satisfy the requirements applicable to a ric  to avoid payment of excise taxes and to minimize or to avoid payment of corporate level federal income taxes  we intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our net ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains over realized net long term capital losses except that we may retain certain net long term capital gains  pay applicable income taxes with respect thereto  and elect to treat such retained capital gains as deemed distributions to our stockholders 
as a bdc  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
because we continue to need capital to grow our loan and investment portfolio  this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so 
we cannot assure you that debt and equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  and debt financings may be restricted by the terms of any of our outstanding borrowings 
in addition  as a bdc  we are limited in our ability to issue equity securities priced below nav 
if additional funds are not available to us  we could be forced to curtail or cease new lending and investment activities  and our nav could decline 
if we are unable to obtain additional debt financing  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we may want to obtain additional debt financing  or need to do so upon maturity of the credit facilities or senior notes  in order to obtain funds which may be made available for investments 
we may borrow under the wells facility until july   and  after such date  we must repay the outstanding advances under the wells facility in accordance with its terms and conditions 
all outstanding advances under the wells facility are due and payable on july   unless such date is extended in accordance with its terms 
we may borrow under the fortress facility until august   and  after such date  we must repay the outstanding advances under the fortress facility in accordance with its terms and conditions 
all outstanding advances under the fortress facility are due and payable on august  unless such date is extended in accordance with its terms 
all outstanding amounts on our senior notes are due and payable on march  unless redeemed prior to that date 
if we are unable to increase  renew or replace any such facility and enter into a new debt financing facility on commercially reasonable terms  our liquidity may be reduced significantly 
in addition  if we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under any such facilities and are declared in default or are unable to renew or refinance these facilities  we may not be able to make new investments or operate our business in the normal course 
these situations may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as lack of access to the credit markets  a severe decline in the value of the us dollar  a further economic downturn or an operational problem that affects third parties or us  and could materially damage our business 
moreover  we have withdrawn our application to the small business administration sba for a license to operate as a small business investment company sbic  which was originally filed on december   and  though we may in the future submit a new application  we have no present intention to do so and  therefore  do not expect to be able to borrow money by issuing sba guaranteed debentures 
changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income 
because we currently incur indebtedness to fund our investments  a portion of our income depends upon the difference between the interest rate at which we borrow funds and the interest rate at which we invest these funds 
most of our investments have fixed interest rates  while our credit facilities have floating interest rates 
as a result  a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds could increase  which would reduce our net investment income 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as swaps  futures  options and forward contracts  subject to applicable legal requirements  including  without limitation  all necessary registrations or exemptions from registration with the commodity futures trading commission 
these activities may limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio 
adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions or any adverse developments from our use of hedging instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may be unable to enter into appropriate hedging transactions when desired and any hedging transactions we enter into may not be effective 
because many of our investments typically are not and will not be in publicly traded securities  the value of our investments may not be readily determinable  which could adversely affect the determination of our nav 
our investments consist  and we expect our future investments to consist  primarily of loans or securities issued by privately held companies 
the fair value of these investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable 
in addition  we are not permitted to maintain a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we are required by the act to specifically value each investment and record an unrealized gain or loss for any asset that we believe has increased or decreased in value 
we value these investments on a quarterly basis  or more frequently as circumstances require  in accordance with our valuation policy consistent with generally accepted accounting principles 
our board employs an independent third party valuation firm to assist them in arriving at the fair value of our investments 
our board discusses valuations and determines the fair value in good faith based on the input of our advisor and the third party valuation firm 
the factors that may be considered in fair value pricing our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s earnings and its ability to make payments on its indebtedness  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons to publicly traded companies  discounted cash flow and other relevant factors 
because such valuations are inherently uncertain and may be based on estimates  our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would be assessed if a ready market for these securities existed 
our nav could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of these investments 
disruption in the capital markets and the credit markets could adversely affect our business 
without sufficient access to the capital markets or credit markets  we may be forced to curtail our business operations or we may not be able to pursue new investment opportunities 
the global capital markets are in a period of disruption and extreme volatility and  accordingly  there has been and will continue to be uncertainty in the financial markets in general 
a prolonged period of market illiquidity or uncertainty regarding us government spending levels  including negotiation of federal spending cuts  and implementation of global fiscal austerity measures may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unfavorable economic conditions  including future recessions  also could affect our investment valuations  increase our funding costs  limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us or our portfolio companies 
these events could limit our investment originations  limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results 
we are unable to predict when economic and market conditions may become more favorable 
even if these conditions improve significantly over the long term  adverse conditions in particular sectors of the financial markets could adversely impact our business 
we may not realize gains from our equity investments 
we may make non control  equity co investments in companies in conjunction with private equity sponsors 
the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and  in fact  may decline in value 
accordingly  we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests  and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience 
we also may be unable to realize any value if a portfolio company does not have a liquidity event  such as a sale of the business  refinancing or public offering  which would allow us to sell the underlying equity interests 
in addition  our advisor s significant experience in venture lending may not result in returns on our equity investments 
from time to time we may also acquire equity participation rights in connection with an investment which will allow us  at our option  to participate in future rounds of equity financing through direct capital investments in our portfolio companies 
our advisor determines whether to exercise any of these rights 
accordingly  you will have no control over whether or to what extent these rights are exercised  if at all 
if we exercise these rights  we will be making an additional investment completely in the form of equity which will subject us to significantly more risk than our venture loans and we may not receive the returns that are anticipated with respect to these investments 
we may not realize expected returns on warrants received in connection with our debt investments 
as discussed above  we generally receive warrants in connection with our debt investments 
if we do not receive the returns that are anticipated on the warrants  our investment returns on our portfolio companies  and the value of your investment in us  may be lower than expected 
regulations governing our operation as a bdc affect our ability to  and the way in which  we raise additional capital  which may expose us to additional risks 
our business plans contemplate a need for a substantial amount of capital in addition to our current amount of capital 
we may obtain additional capital through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  and we may borrow money from banks or other financial institutions  which we refer to collectively as senior securities  up to the maximum amount permitted by the act 
if we issue senior securities  we would be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage  including an increased risk of loss 
in addition  if we issue preferred stock  it would rank senior to common stock in our capital structure and preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights and may have rights  preferences or privileges more favorable than those of holders of our common stock 
the act permits us to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio  as defined in the act  equals at least after each issuance of senior securities 
if our asset coverage ratio is not at least  we are not permitted to pay dividends or issue additional senior securities 
if the value of our assets declines  we may be unable to satisfy this asset coverage test 
if that happens  we may be required to liquidate a portion of our investments and repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when we may be unable to do so or unable to do so on favorable terms 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding borrowings 
as a bdc  we generally are not able to issue our common stock at a price below nav without first obtaining the approval of our stockholders and our independent directors  and we may seek such approval to sell our common stock below nav in the future 
this requirement does not apply to stock issued upon the exercise of options  warrants or rights that we may issue from time to time 
if we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into  or exchangeable for  our common stock  the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time would decrease  and you may experience dilution 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements under the code for qualification as a ric  we will be subject to corporate level federal income tax 
to qualify as a ric under the code  we must meet certain source of income  diversification and other requirements contained in subchapter m of the code and maintain our election to be regulated as a bdc under the act 
we must also meet the annual distribution requirement to avoid corporate level federal income tax in that year on all of our taxable income  regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders 
the source of income requirement is satisfied if we derive in each taxable year at least of our gross income from dividends  interest including tax exempt interest  payments with respect to certain securities loans  gains from the sale or other disposition of stock  securities or foreign currencies  other income including but not limited to gain from options  futures or forward contracts derived with respect to our business of investing in stock  securities or currencies  or net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership 
the status of certain forms of income we receive could be subject to different interpretations under the code and might be characterized as non qualifying income that could cause us to fail to qualify as a ric  assuming we do not qualify for or take advantage of certain remedial provisions  and  thus  may cause us to be subject to corporate level federal income taxes 
the annual distribution requirement for a ric is satisfied if we distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis an amount equal to at least of our net ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any 
if we borrow money  we may be subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the act and loan covenants that could  under certain circumstances  restrict us from making distributions necessary to qualify as a ric 
if we are unable to obtain cash from other sources  we may fail to qualify as a ric  assuming we do not qualify for or take advantage of certain remedial provisions  and  thus  may be subject to corporate level income tax 
to qualify as a ric  we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each calendar quarter 
failure to meet these tests may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly  raise additional capital to prevent the loss of ric status  or engage in certain remedial actions that may entail the disposition of certain investments at disadvantageous prices that could result in substantial losses  and the payment of penalties  if we qualify to take such actions 
because most of our investments are and will be in development stage companies within our target industries  any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and may result in substantial losses 
if we raise additional capital to satisfy the asset diversification requirements  it could take a longer time to invest such capital 
during this period  we will invest in temporary investments  such as money market funds  which we expect will earn yields substantially lower than the interest income that we anticipate receiving in respect of our investments in secured and amortizing loans 
if we were to fail to qualify for the federal income tax benefits allowable to rics for any reason and become subject to a corporate level federal income tax  the resulting taxes could substantially reduce our net assets  the amount of income available for distribution to our stockholders  and the actual amount of our distributions 
such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us  the nav of our common stock and the total return  if any  obtainable from your investment in our common stock 
in addition  we could be required to recognize unrealized gains  pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a ric 
see regulation 
we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash 
we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash 
for example  if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount such as debt instruments with payment in kind interest or  in certain cases  increasing interest rates or issued with warrants  we must include in taxable income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the debt instrument  regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year 
we do not have a policy limiting our ability to invest in original issue discount instruments  including payment in kind loans 
because in certain cases we may recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement that we distribute an amount equal to at least of our net ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized long term capital losses  if any 
accordingly  we may need to sell some of our assets at times that we would not consider advantageous  raise additional debt or equity capital or forego new investment opportunities or otherwise take actions that are disadvantageous to our business or be unable to take actions that we believe are necessary or advantageous to our business in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement 
if we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy the annual distribution requirement  we may fail to qualify for the federal income tax benefits allowable to rics and  thus  become subject to a corporate level federal income tax on all our income 
the proportion of our income  consisting of net investment income and our realized gains and losses  that resulted from the portion of original issue discount not received in cash for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
if we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets  we could fail to qualify as a bdc or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy 
as a bdc  we are prohibited from acquiring any assets other than qualifying assets unless  at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets 
substantially all of our assets are qualifying assets and we expect that substantially all of our assets that we may acquire in the future will be qualifying assets  although we may decide to make other investments that are not qualifying assets to the extent permitted by the act 
if we acquire debt or equity securities from an issuer that has outstanding marginable securities at the time we make an investment  these acquired assets may not be treated as qualifying assets 
this result is dictated by the definition of eligible portfolio company under the act  which in part looks to whether a company has outstanding marginable securities 
see item above  regulation qualifying assets 
if we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets  we could lose our status as a bdc  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in laws or regulations governing our business could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in the laws or regulations or the interpretations of the laws and regulations that govern bdc  rics  or non depository commercial lenders could significantly affect our operations  our cost of doing business and our investment strategy 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations and judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations  including our loan originations  maximum interest rates  fees and other charges  disclosures to portfolio companies  the terms of secured transactions  collection and foreclosure procedures  portfolio composition and other trade practices 
if these laws  regulations or decisions change  or if we expand our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent requirements  we may incur significant expenses to comply with these laws  regulations or decisions or we might have to restrict our operations or alter our investment strategy 
in addition  if we do not comply with applicable laws  regulations and decisions  we may lose licenses needed for the conduct of our business and be subject to civil fines and criminal penalties  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our advisor has significant potential conflicts of interest with us and our stockholders 
as a result of our arrangements with our advisor  there may be times when our advisor has interests that differ from those of our stockholders  giving rise to a potential conflict of interest 
our executive officers and directors  as well as the current and future executives and employees of our advisor  serve or may serve as officers  directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do 
accordingly  they may have obligations to investors in those entities  the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of our stockholders 
in addition  our advisor may manage other funds in the future that may have investment objectives that are similar  in whole or in part  to ours 
our advisor may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds 
in such an event  depending on the availability of the investment and other appropriate factors  our advisor will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and act in accordance with its written conflicts of interest policy to address and  if necessary  resolve any conflict of interests 
it is also possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in these other investment opportunities 
we pay management and incentive fees to our advisor and reimburse our advisor for certain expenses it incurs 
as a result  investors in our common stock invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses  resulting in a lower rate of return than an investor might achieve through direct investments 
also  the incentive fee payable by us to our advisor may create an incentive for our advisor to pursue investments on our behalf that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangements 
we have entered into a license agreement with horizon technology finance  llc  pursuant to which it has agreed to grant us a non exclusive  royalty free right and license to use the service mark horizon technology finance 
under this agreement  we have a right to use the horizon technology finance service mark for so long as the investment management agreement is in effect between us and our advisor 
in addition  we pay our advisor  our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our advisor in performing its obligations under the administration agreement  including rent  the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions  and our allocable portion of the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs 
any potential conflict of interest arising as a result of our arrangements with our advisor could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our incentive fee may impact our advisor s structuring of our investments  including by causing our advisor to pursue speculative investments 
the incentive fee payable by us to our advisor may create an incentive for our advisor to pursue investments on our behalf that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement 
the incentive fee payable to our advisor is calculated based on a percentage of our return on invested capital 
this may encourage our advisor to use leverage to increase the return on our investments 
under certain circumstances  the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default  which would impair the value of our common stock 
in addition  our advisor receives the incentive fee based  in part  upon net capital gains realized on our investments 
unlike that portion of the incentive fee based on income  there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains 
as a result  our advisor may have a tendency to invest more capital in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities 
such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative investments than would otherwise be the case  which could result in higher investment losses  particularly during economic downturns 
in addition  the incentive fee may encourage our advisor to pursue different types of investments or structure investments in ways that are more likely to result in warrant gains or gains on equity investments  including upon exercise of equity participation rights  which are inconsistent with our investment strategy and disciplined underwriting process 
the incentive fee payable by us to our advisor may also induce our advisor to pursue investments on our behalf that have a deferred interest feature  even if such deferred payments would not provide cash necessary to enable us to pay current distributions to our stockholders 
under these investments  we would accrue interest over the life of the investment but would not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term 
our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our investment fee  however  includes accrued interest 
thus  a portion of this incentive fee would be based on income that we have not yet received in cash 
in addition  the catch up portion of the incentive fee may encourage our advisor to accelerate or defer interest payable by portfolio companies from one calendar quarter to another  potentially resulting in fluctuations in the timing and amounts of dividends 
our governing documents do not limit the number of loans we may make with deferred interest features or the proportion of our income we derive from such loans 
our advisor s liability is limited  and we have agreed to indemnify our advisor against certain liabilities  which may lead our advisor to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account 
under the investment management agreement  our advisor does not assume any responsibility to us other than to render the services called for under that agreement  and it is not responsible for any action of our board in following or declining to follow our advisor s advice or recommendations 
under the terms of the investment management agreement  our advisor  its officers  members  personnel and any person controlling or controlled by our advisor is not liable to us  any subsidiary of ours  our directors  our stockholders or any subsidiary s stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the investment management agreement  except those resulting from acts constituting gross negligence  willful misconduct  bad faith or reckless disregard of our advisor s duties under the investment management agreement 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify our advisor and each of its officers  directors  members  managers and employees from and against any claims or liabilities  including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred  arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the investment management agreement  except where attributable to gross negligence  willful misconduct  bad faith or reckless disregard of such person s duties under the investment management agreement 
these protections may lead our advisor to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account 
if we are unable to manage our future growth effectively  we may be unable to achieve our investment objective  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of your investment in us to decline 
our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our ability to achieve and sustain growth  which depends  in turn  on our advisor s direct origination capabilities and disciplined underwriting process in identifying  evaluating  financing  investing in and monitoring suitable companies that meet our investment criteria 
accomplishing this result on a cost effective basis is largely a function of our advisor s marketing capabilities  management of the investment process  ability to provide efficient services and access to financing sources on acceptable terms 
in addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments  our advisor may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
these demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment 
if we fail to manage our future growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and the value of your investment in us could decrease 
our board may change our operating policies and strategies  including our investment objective  without prior notice or stockholder approval  the effects of which may adversely affect our business 
our board may modify or waive our current operating policies and strategies  including our investment objectives  without prior notice and without stockholder approval provided that no such modification or waiver may change the nature of our business so as to cease to be  or withdraw our election as a bdc as provided by the act without stockholder approval at a special meeting called upon written notice of not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of such meeting 
we cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business  results of operations or financial condition or on the value of our stock 
however  the effects of any changes might adversely affect our business  any or all of which could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends or cause you to lose all or part of your investment in us 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to the nature of our business 
we could experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including our ability to make investments in companies that meet our investment criteria  the interest rate payable on our loans  the default rate on these investments  the level of our expenses  variations in  and the timing of  the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses  the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions 
for example  we have historically experienced greater investment activity during the second and fourth quarters relative to other periods 
as a result of these factors  you should not rely on the results for any prior period as being indicative of our performance in future periods 
our business plan and growth strategy depends to a significant extent upon our advisor s referral relationships 
if our advisor is unable to develop new or maintain existing relationships  or if these relationships fail to generate investment opportunities  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we have historically depended on our advisor s referral relationships to generate investment opportunities 
for us to achieve our future business objectives  members of our advisor need to maintain these relationships with venture capital and private equity firms and management teams and legal firms  accounting firms  investment banks and other lenders  and we rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with investment opportunities 
if they fail to maintain their existing relationships or develop new relationships with other firms or sources of investment opportunities  we may not be able to grow our investment portfolio 
in addition  persons with whom our advisor has relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities  and  therefore  there is no assurance that such relationships will lead to the origination of debt or other investments 
our advisor can resign on days notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time  resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
under our investment management agreement  our advisor has the right to resign at any time  including during the first two years following the investment management agreement s effective date  upon not more than days written notice  whether we have found a replacement or not 
if our advisor resigns  we may not be able to find a new investment advisor or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within days  or at all 
if we are unable to do so  our operations are likely to be disrupted  our business  results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected and the market price of our shares may decline 
in addition  the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our advisor and its affiliates 
even if we are able to retain comparable management  whether internal or external  the integration of new management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted 
as a bdc  we are prohibited under the act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and  in some cases  the sec 
any person that owns  directly or indirectly  or more of our outstanding voting securities is considered our affiliate for purposes of the act 
we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to an affiliate  absent the prior approval of our independent directors 
the act also prohibits certain joint transactions with an affiliate  which could include investments in the same portfolio company whether at the same or different times  without prior approval of our independent directors 
if a person acquires more than of our voting securities  we are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to that person or certain of that person s affiliates  or entering into prohibited joint transactions with those persons  absent the prior approval of the sec 
similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates 
these restrictions could limit or prohibit us from making certain attractive investments that we might otherwise make absent such restrictions 
while we have no current intention to enter into any principal transactions or joint arrangements with any affiliates  we have considered and evaluated  and will continue to consider and evaluate  the potential advantages and disadvantages of doing so 
if we decide to enter into any such transactions in the future we will not do so until we have requested and received the requisite exemptive relief under section of the act  the filing of which our board has previously authorized 
we incur significant costs as a result of being a publicly traded company 
as a publicly traded company  we incur legal  accounting and other expenses  including costs associated with the periodic reporting requirements applicable to a company whose securities are registered under the securities exchange act of  as amended  as well as additional corporate governance requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act  and other rules implemented by the sec 
efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act may involve significant expenditures  and non compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act may adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 
under current sec rules  we are required to report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act and related rules and regulations of the sec 
as a result  we incur additional expenses that may negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to make distributions 
this process also results in a diversion of management s time and attention 
we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations  and we may not be able to ensure that the process is effective or that our internal control over financial reporting is or will be effective in a timely manner 
in the event that we are unable to maintain or achieve compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and related rules  we and the market price of our securities may be adversely affected 
terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events may disrupt the businesses in which we invest and harm our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity or acts of war may significantly harm our results of operations and your investment 
we cannot assure you that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
such attacks or armed conflicts in the united states or elsewhere may impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly  by undermining economic conditions in the united states or elsewhere 
in addition  because many of our portfolio companies operate and rely on network infrastructure and enterprise applications and internal technology systems for development  marketing  operational  support and other business activities  a disruption or failure of any or all of these systems in the event of a major telecommunications failure  cyber attack  fire  earthquake  severe weather conditions or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  delays in product development and loss of critical data and could otherwise disrupt their business operations 
losses resulting from terrorist attacks are generally uninsurable 
risks related to our investments we have not yet identified many of the potential investment opportunities for our portfolio 
we have not yet identified many of the potential investment opportunities for our portfolio 
our future investments will be selected by our advisor  subject to the approval of its investment committee 
our stockholders do not have input into our advisor s investment decisions 
as a result  our stockholders are unable to evaluate any of our future portfolio company investments 
these factors increase the uncertainty  and thus the risk  of investing in our securities 
we are a non diversified investment company within the meaning of the act  and therefore we generally are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer 
we are classified as a non diversified investment company within the meaning of the act  which means that we are not limited by the act with respect to the proportion of our assets that we may invest in securities of a single issuer  excluding limitations on stake holdings in investment companies 
to the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers  our nav may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as a result of changes in the financial condition or the market s assessment of the issuer 
we may also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence than a diversified investment company 
beyond our income tax diversification requirements  we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification  and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few portfolio companies 
if our investments do not meet our performance expectations  you may not receive distributions 
we intend to make distributions of income on a monthly basis to our stockholders 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a bdc  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions 
also  restrictions and provisions in any existing or future credit facilities may limit our ability to make distributions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including the possible loss of the federal income tax benefits allowable to rics 
most of our portfolio companies will need additional capital  which may not be readily available 
our portfolio companies typically require substantial additional financing to satisfy their continuing working capital and other capital requirements and service the interest and principal payments on our investments 
we cannot predict the circumstances or market conditions under which our portfolio companies will seek additional capital 
each round of institutional equity financing is typically intended to provide a company with only enough capital to reach the next stage of development 
it is possible that one or more of our portfolio companies will not be able to raise additional financing or may be able to do so only at a price or on terms that are unfavorable to the portfolio company  either of which would negatively impact our investment returns 
some of these companies may be unable to obtain sufficient financing from private investors  public capital markets or lenders  thereby requiring these companies to cease or curtail business operations 
accordingly  investing in these types of companies generally entails a higher risk of loss than investing in companies that do not have significant incremental capital raising requirements 
economic recessions or downturns could adversely affect our business and that of our portfolio companies which may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
general economic conditions may affect our activities and the operation and value of our portfolio companies 
economic slowdowns or recessions may result in a decrease of institutional equity investment  which would limit our lending opportunities 
furthermore  many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods 
therefore  our non performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods 
adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments 
economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues  net income and assets 
unfavorable economic conditions could also increase our funding costs  limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us 
a portfolio company s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and  potentially  termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets  which could trigger cross defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio company s ability to meet its obligations under the loans that we hold 
we may incur expenses to the extent necessary to recover our investment upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company 
these events could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our investment strategy focuses on investments in development stage companies in our target industries  which are subject to many risks  including volatility  intense competition  shortened product life cycles and periodic downturns  and would be rated below investment grade 
we intend to invest  under normal circumstances  most of the value of our total assets including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in development stage companies  which may have relatively limited operating histories  in our target industries 
many of these companies may have narrow product lines and small market shares  compared to larger established publicly owned firms  which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and market conditions  as well as general economic downturns 
the revenues  income or losses and valuations of development stage companies in our target industries can and often do fluctuate suddenly and dramatically 
for these reasons  investments in our portfolio companies  if rated by one or more ratings agency  would typically be rated below investment grade  which refers to securities rated by ratings agencies below the four highest rating categories 
these companies may also have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs 
in addition  development stage technology markets are generally characterized by abrupt business cycles and intense competition  and the competitive environment can change abruptly due to rapidly evolving technology 
therefore  our portfolio companies may face considerably more risk than companies in other industry sectors 
accordingly  these factors could impair their cash flow or result in other events  such as bankruptcy  which could limit their ability to repay their obligations to us and may materially adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investments in these businesses 
because of rapid technological change  the average selling prices of products and some services provided by development stage companies in our target industries have historically decreased over their productive lives 
these decreases could adversely affect their operating results and cash flow  their ability to meet obligations under their debt securities and the value of their equity securities 
this could  in turn  materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any unrealized depreciation we experience on our loan portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses  which could reduce our income available for distribution 
as a bdc  we are required to carry our investments at fair value which shall be the market value of our investments or  if no market value is ascertainable  at the fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to procedures approved by our board in accordance with our valuation policy 
we are not permitted to maintain a reserve for loan losses 
decreases in the fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation 
any unrealized depreciation in our loan portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio company s inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected loans 
this could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately reduces our income available for distribution in future periods 
if the assets securing the loans we make decrease in value  we may not have sufficient collateral to cover losses and may experience losses upon foreclosure 
we believe our portfolio companies generally are and will be able to repay our loans from their available capital  from future capital raising transactions or from cash flow from operations 
however  to mitigate our credit risks  we typically take a security interest in all or a portion of the assets of our portfolio companies  including the equity interests of their subsidiaries 
there is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time  may be difficult to appraise or sell in a timely manner and may fluctuate in value based upon the business and market conditions  including as a result of an inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital  and  in some circumstances  our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors 
in addition  deterioration of a portfolio company s financial condition and prospects  including its inability to raise additional capital  may be accompanied by deterioration of the value of the collateral for the loan 
consequently  although such loan is secured  we may not receive principal and interest payments according to the loan s terms and the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to recover our investment should we be forced to enforce our remedies 
in addition  because we invest in development stage companies in our target industries  a substantial portion of the assets securing our investment may be in the form of intellectual property  if any  inventory  equipment  cash and accounts receivables 
intellectual property  if any  which secures a loan could lose value if the company s rights to the intellectual property are challenged or if the company s license to the intellectual property is revoked or expires 
in addition  in lieu of a security interest in a portfolio company s intellectual property we may sometimes obtain a security interest in all assets of the portfolio company other than intellectual property and also obtain a commitment by the portfolio company not to grant liens to any other creditor on the company s intellectual property 
in these cases  we may have additional difficulty recovering our principal in the event of a foreclosure 
similarly  any equipment securing our loan may not provide us with the anticipated security if there are changes in technology or advances in new equipment that render the particular equipment obsolete or of limited value or if the company fails to adequately maintain or repair the equipment 
any one or more of the preceding factors could materially impair our ability to recover principal in a foreclosure 
we may choose to waive or defer enforcement of covenants in the debt securities held in our portfolio  which may cause us to lose all or part of our investment in these companies 
we structure the debt investments in our portfolio companies to include business and financial covenants placing affirmative and negative obligations on the operation of the company s business and its financial condition 
however  from time to time we may elect to waive breaches of these covenants  including our right to payment  or waive or defer enforcement of remedies  such as acceleration of obligations or foreclosure on collateral  depending upon the financial condition and prospects of the particular portfolio company 
these actions may reduce the likelihood of our receiving the full amount of future payments of interest or principal and be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of the underlying collateral as many of these companies may have limited financial resources  may be unable to meet future obligations and may go bankrupt 
these events could harm our financial condition and operating results 
the lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business  and if we need to sell any of our investments  we may not be able to do so at a favorable price 
as a result  we may suffer losses 
we plan to generally invest in loans with terms of up to four years and hold such investments until maturity  unless earlier prepaid  and we do not expect that our related holdings of equity securities will provide us with liquidity opportunities in the near term 
we expect to primarily invest in companies whose securities are not publicly traded  and whose securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities 
the illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired 
we may also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a public portfolio company to the extent that we possess material non public information regarding the portfolio company 
in addition  if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly  we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments 
as a result  we do not expect to dispose of our investments in the near term 
however  we may be required to do so in order to maintain our qualification as a bdc and as a ric if we do not satisfy one or more of the applicable criteria under the respective regulatory frameworks 
because most of our investments are illiquid  we may be unable to dispose of them  in which case we could fail to qualify as a ric and or bdc  or we may not be able to dispose of them at favorable prices  and as a result  we may suffer losses 
our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with  or senior to  our investments in such companies 
we plan to invest primarily in loans issued by our portfolio companies 
some of our portfolio companies are permitted to have other debt that ranks equally with  or senior to  our loans in the portfolio company 
by their terms  these debt instruments may provide that the holders thereof are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of our loans 
these debt instruments may prohibit the portfolio companies from paying interest on or repaying our investments in the event of  and during  the continuance of a default under the debt instruments 
in addition  in the event of insolvency  liquidation  dissolution  reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company  holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any payment in respect of our investment 
after repaying senior creditors  a portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us 
in the case of debt ranking equally with our loans  we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency  liquidation  dissolution  reorganization or bankruptcy 
there may be circumstances where our loans could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims 
even though certain of our investments are structured as senior loans  if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt  depending on the facts and circumstances  including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company  a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt investment and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors 
we may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a portfolio company s business  including in rendering significant managerial assistance  or instances where we exercise control over the portfolio company 
an investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges  including the lack of available information about these companies  a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns 
we currently invest  and plan to invest  primarily in privately held companies 
generally  very little public information exists about these companies  and we are required to rely on the ability of our advisor to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies 
if we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies  we may not make a fully informed investment decision  and we may lose money on our investments 
also  privately held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and a smaller market presence than larger competitors 
thus  they are generally more vulnerable to economic downturns and may experience substantial variations in operating results 
these factors could affect our investment returns 
in addition  our success depends  in large part  upon the abilities of the key management personnel of our portfolio companies  who are responsible for the day to day operations of our portfolio companies 
competition for qualified personnel is intense at any stage of a company s development 
the loss of one or more key managers can hinder or delay a company s implementation of its business plan and harm its financial condition 
our portfolio companies may not be able to attract and retain qualified managers and personnel 
any inability to do so may negatively affect our investment returns 
prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity 
we are subject to the risk that the investments we make in our portfolio companies may be repaid prior to maturity 
for example  most of our debt investments have historically been repaid prior to maturity by our portfolio companies 
at the time of a liquidity event  such as a sale of the business  refinancing or public offering  many of our portfolio companies have availed themselves of the opportunity to repay our loans prior to maturity 
our investments generally allow for repayment at any time subject to certain penalties 
when this occurs  we generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments  pending their future investment in new portfolio companies 
these temporary investments have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid  and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts 
any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid 
as a result  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elects to prepay amounts owed to us 
additionally  prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity  which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 
our business and growth strategy could be adversely affected if government regulations  priorities and resources impacting the industries in which our portfolio companies operate change 
some of our portfolio companies operate in industries that are highly regulated by federal  state and or local agencies 
changes in existing laws  rules or regulations  or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof  or new laws  rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on the business and industries of our portfolio companies 
in addition  changes in government priorities or limitations on government resources could also adversely impact our portfolio companies 
we are unable to predict whether any such changes in laws  rules or regulations will occur and  if they do occur  the impact of these changes on our portfolio companies and our investment returns 
our portfolio companies operating in the life science industry are subject to extensive government regulation and certain other risks particular to that industry 
as part of our investment strategy  we have invested  and plan to invest in the future  in companies in the life science industry that are subject to extensive regulation by the food and drug administration and to a lesser extent  other federal and state agencies 
if any of these portfolio companies fail to comply with applicable regulations  they could be subject to significant penalties and claims that could materially and adversely affect their operations 
portfolio companies that produce medical devices or drugs are subject to the expense  delay and uncertainty of the regulatory approval process for their products and  even if approved  these products may not be accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  new laws  regulations or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations might adversely affect a portfolio company in this industry 
portfolio companies in the life science industry may also have a limited number of suppliers of necessary components or a limited number of manufacturers for their products  and therefore face a risk of disruption to their manufacturing process if they are unable to find alternative suppliers when needed 
any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the operations of a portfolio company in this industry and  in turn  impair our ability to timely collect principal and interest payments owed to us 
our investments in the clean technology industry are subject to many risks  including volatility  intense competition  unproven technologies  periodic downturns and potential litigation 
our investments in clean technology  or cleantech  companies are subject to substantial operational risks  such as underestimated cost projections  unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses  loss of government subsidies  and inability to deliver cost effective alternative energy solutions compared to traditional energy products 
in addition  energy companies employ a variety of means of increasing cash flow  including increasing utilization of existing facilities  expanding operations through new construction or acquisitions  or securing additional long term contracts 
thus  some energy companies may be subject to construction risk  acquisition risk or other risks arising from their specific business strategies 
furthermore  production levels for solar  wind and other renewable energies may be dependent upon adequate sunlight  wind  or biogas production  which can vary from market to market and period to period  resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability 
in addition  our cleantech companies may have narrow product lines and small market shares  which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and market conditions  as well as to general economic downturns 
the revenues  income or losses and valuations of clean technology companies can and often do fluctuate suddenly and dramatically and the markets in which clean technology companies operate are generally characterized by abrupt business cycles and intense competition 
demand for cleantech and renewable energy is also influenced by the available supply and prices for other energy products  such as coal  oil and natural gas 
a change in prices in these energy products could reduce demand for alternative energy 
cleantech companies face potential litigation  including significant warranty and product liability claims  as well as class action and government claims 
such litigation could adversely affect the business and results of operations of our cleantech portfolio companies 
there is also uncertainty about whether agreements or government programs providing incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will continue and whether countries around the world will enact or maintain legislation that provides incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  without which some investments in clean technology dependent portfolio companies may not be economical  and financing for such projects may become unavailable 
as a result  these portfolio company investments face considerable risk  including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified 
this could  in turn  materially adversely affect the value of the clean technology companies in our portfolio 
cleantech companies are subject to extensive government regulation and certain other risks particular to the sectors in which they operate and our business and growth strategy could be adversely affected if government regulations  priorities and resources impacting such sectors change or if our portfolio companies fail to comply with such regulations 
as part of our investment strategy we invest in portfolio companies in cleantech sectors that may be subject to extensive regulation by foreign  us federal  state and or local agencies 
changes in existing laws  rules or regulations  or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof  or new laws  rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on the business and industries of our portfolio companies 
in addition  changes in government priorities or limitations on government resources could also adversely impact our portfolio companies 
we are unable to predict whether any such changes in laws  rules or regulations will occur and  if they do occur  the impact of these changes on our portfolio companies and our investment returns 
furthermore  if any of our portfolio companies fail to comply with applicable regulations  they could be subject to significant penalties and claims that could materially and adversely affect their operations 
our portfolio companies may be subject to the expense  delay and uncertainty of the regulatory approval process for their products and  even if approved  these products may not be accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  there is considerable uncertainty about whether foreign  us  state and or local governmental entities will enact or maintain legislation or regulatory programs that mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or provide incentives for cleantech companies 
without such regulatory policies  investments in cleantech companies may not be economical and financing for cleantech companies may become unavailable  which could materially adversely affect the ability of our portfolio companies to repay the debt they owe to us 
any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the operations and financial condition of a portfolio company and  in turn  the ability of the portfolio company to repay the debt they owe to us 
if our portfolio companies are unable to commercialize their technologies  products  business concepts or services  the returns on our investments could be adversely affected 
the value of our investments in our portfolio companies may decline if our portfolio companies are not able to commercialize their technology  products  business concepts or services 
additionally  although some of our portfolio companies may already have a commercially successful product or product line at the time of our investment  technology related products and services often have a more limited market or life span than products in other industries 
thus  the ultimate success of these companies often depends on their ability to innovate continually in increasingly competitive markets 
if they are unable to do so  our investment returns could be adversely affected and their ability to service their debt obligations to us over the life of a loan could be impaired 
our portfolio companies may be unable to acquire or develop successful new technologies and the intellectual property they currently hold may not remain viable 
even if our portfolio companies are able to develop commercially viable products  the market for new products and services is highly competitive and rapidly changing 
neither our portfolio companies nor we have any control over the pace of technology development 
commercial success is difficult to predict  and the marketing efforts of our portfolio companies may not be successful 
if our portfolio companies are unable to protect their intellectual property rights  our business and prospects could be harmed  and if portfolio companies are required to devote significant resources to protecting their intellectual property rights  the value of our investment could be reduced 
our future success and competitive position depends in part upon the ability of our portfolio companies to obtain  maintain and protect proprietary technology used in their products and services 
the intellectual property held by our portfolio companies often represents a substantial portion of the collateral securing our investments and or constitutes a significant portion of the portfolio companies value that may be available in a downside scenario to repay our loans 
our portfolio companies rely  in part  on patent  trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology  but competitors may misappropriate their intellectual property  and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise 
portfolio companies may  from time to time  be required to institute litigation to enforce their patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights  protect their trade secrets  determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
similarly  if a portfolio company is found to infringe or misappropriate a third party s patent or other proprietary rights  it could be required to pay damages to the third party  alter its products or processes  obtain a license from the third party and or cease activities utilizing the proprietary rights  including making or selling products utilizing the proprietary rights 
any of the foregoing events could negatively affect both the portfolio company s ability to service our debt investment and the value of any related debt and equity securities that we own  as well as the value of any collateral securing our investment 
we do not expect to control any of our portfolio companies 
we do not control  or expect to control in the future  any of our portfolio companies  even though our debt agreements may contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the business and operations of our portfolio companies 
we also do not maintain  or intend to maintain in the future  a control position to the extent we own equity interests in any portfolio company 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company  as representatives of the holders of their common equity  may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors 
due to the lack of liquidity of the investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies  we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and we may therefore  suffer a decrease in the value of our investments 
risks related to our common stock there is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive dividends or that our dividends may not grow over time and  a portion of distributions paid to you may be a return of capital 
we intend to make distributions on a monthly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year to year increases in cash distributions 
our ability to pay dividends might be adversely affected by  among other things  the impact of one or more risk factors described in this report 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a bdc  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions 
all distributions will be paid at the discretion of our board and will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our ric status  compliance with bdc regulation and such other factors as our board may deem relevant from time to time 
we cannot assure you that we will pay distributions to our stockholders in the future 
further  if we invest a greater amount of assets in equity securities that do not pay current dividends  that could reduce the amount available for distribution 
on an annual basis  we must determine the extent to which any distributions we made were paid out of current or accumulated earnings  recognized capital gains or capital 
to the extent there is a return of capital  investors will be required to reduce their basis in our stock for us federal income tax purposes  which will result in higher tax liability when the shares are sold  even if they have not increased in value or have lost value 
in addition  any return of capital will be net of any sales load and offering expenses associated with sales of shares of our common stock 
in the future  our distributions may include a return of capital 
we cannot assure you that the market price of shares of our common stock will not decline 
our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select market 
we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade 
shares of closed end management investment companies have in the past frequently traded at discounts to their navs  and our common stock has been and may continue to be discounted in the market 
this characteristic of closed end management investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our nav per share may decline 
we cannot predict whether shares of our common stock will trade above  at or below our nav 
if our common stock trades below its nav  we will generally not be able to sell additional shares of our common stock without first obtaining the approval of our stockholders including our unaffiliated stockholders and our independent directors 
our common stock price may be volatile and may decrease substantially 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and the liquidity of our common stock may be limited  in each case depending on many factors  some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance 
these factors include the following price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market or in the market for bdcs from time to time  investor demand for our shares of common stock  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered closed end management investment companies  bdcs or other financial services companies  our inability to raise capital  borrow money or deploy or invest our capital  fluctuations in interest rates  any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts  operating performance of companies comparable to us  changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines with respect to rics or bdcs  losing ric status  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results  changes in the value of our portfolio of investments  general economic conditions  trends and other external factors  departures of key personnel  or loss of a major source of funding 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
due to the potential volatility of our stock price  we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business 
shares of closed end investment companies  including bdcs  frequently trade at a discount to their nav  and we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not decline following an offering 
we cannot predict the price at which our common stock will trade 
shares of closed end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their nav and our stock may also be discounted in the market 
this characteristic of closed end investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our nav per share may decline 
we cannot predict whether shares of our common stock will trade above  at or below our nav 
in addition  if our common stock trades below its nav  we will generally not be able to issue additional shares of our common stock at its market price without first obtaining the approval of our stockholders and our independent directors 
we currently invest a portion of our capital in high quality short term investments  which generate lower rates of return than those expected from investments made in accordance with our investment objective 
we currently invest a portion of the net proceeds of our capital in cash  cash equivalents  us government securities  money market funds and other high quality short term investments 
these securities may earn yields substantially lower than the income that we anticipate receiving once these proceeds are fully invested in accordance with our investment objective 
investing in shares of our common stock may involve an above average degree of risk 
the investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk  volatility or loss of principal than alternative investment options 
our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive  and therefore  an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and other agreements and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law dgcl could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock 
the dgcl  our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us 
among other things  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  which may delay the ability of our stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board to thwart a takeover attempt  do not provide for cumulative voting  provide that vacancies on the board  including newly created directorships  may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office  limit the calling of special meetings of stockholders  provide that our directors may be removed only for cause  require supermajority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws  and require stockholders to provide advance notice of new business proposals and director nominations under specific procedures 
these anti takeover provisions may inhibit a change in control in circumstances that could give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price of our common stock 
it is a default under our credit facilities if i a person or group of persons within the meaning of the exchange act acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our issued and outstanding stock or ii during any twelve month period individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted our board cease for any reason  other than death or disability  to constitute a majority of the directors in office 
if either event were to occur  wells or fortress could accelerate our repayment obligations under  and or terminate  our credit facilities 
if we elect to issue preferred stock  holders of any such preferred stock will have the right to elect members of our board and have class voting rights on certain matters 
the act requires that holders of shares of preferred stock must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on such preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more  until such arrearage is eliminated 
in addition  certain matters under the act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock  including changes in fundamental investment restrictions and conversion to open end status and  accordingly  preferred stockholders could veto any such changes 
restrictions imposed on the declarations and payment of dividends or other distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock  both by the act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies  might impair our ability to maintain our qualification as a ric for us federal income tax purposes 
your interest in us may be diluted if you do not fully exercise your subscription rights in any rights offering 
in addition  if the subscription price is less than our nav per share  then you will experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate nav of your shares 
in the event we issue subscription rights  stockholders who do not fully exercise their rights should expect that they will  at the completion of a rights offering  own a smaller proportional interest in us than would otherwise be the case if they fully exercised their rights 
such dilution is not currently determinable because it is not known what proportion of the shares will be purchased as a result of such rights offering 
any such dilution will disproportionately affect nonexercising stockholders 
if the subscription price per share is substantially less than the current nav per share  this dilution could be substantial 
in addition  if the subscription price is less than our nav per share  our stockholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate nav of their shares as a result of such rights offering 
the amount of any decrease in nav is not predictable because it is not known at this time what the subscription price and nav per share will be on the expiration date of the rights offering or what proportion of the shares will be purchased as a result of such rights offering 
such dilution could be substantial 
investors in offerings of our common stock may incur immediate dilution upon the closing of such offering 
if the public offering price for any offering of shares of our common stock is higher than the book value per share of our outstanding common stock  investors purchasing shares of common stock in any such offering will pay a price per share that exceeds the tangible book value per share after such offering 
if we sell common stock at a discount to our nav per share  stockholders who do not participate in such sale will experience immediate dilution in an amount that may be material 
the issuance or sale by us of shares of our common stock at a discount to nav poses a risk of dilution to our stockholders 
in particular  stockholders who do not purchase additional shares at or below the discounted price in proportion to their current ownership will experience an immediate decrease in nav per share as well as in the aggregate nav of their shares if they do not participate at all 
these stockholders will also experience a disproportionately greater decrease in their participation in our earnings and assets and their voting power than the increase we experience in our assets  potential earning power and voting interests from such issuance or sale 
in addition  such sales may adversely affect the price at which our common stock trades 
stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they do not participate in our dividend reinvestment plan 
all dividends payable to stockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan drip are automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock 
as a result  stockholders that do not participate in the dividend reinvestment plan will experience dilution over time 
the trading market or market value of our publicly issued debt securities that we may issue may fluctuate 
upon issuance  any publicly issued debt securities that we may issue will not have an established trading market 
we cannot assure you that a trading market for our publicly issued debt securities will ever develop or  if developed  will be maintained 
in addition to our creditworthiness  many factors may materially adversely affect the trading market for  and market value of  our publicly issued debt securities 
these factors include the time remaining to the maturity of these debt securities  the outstanding principal amount of debt securities with terms identical to these debt securities  the supply of debt securities trading in the secondary market  if any  the redemption or repayment features  if any of these debt securities  the level  direction and volatility of market interest rates generally  and market rate of interest higher or lower than rate borne by the debt securities 
you should also be aware that there may be a limited number of buyers when you decide to sell your debt securities 
this too may materially adversely affect the market value of the debt securities or the trading market for the debt securities 
terms relating to redemption may materially adversely affect your return on the debt securities that we may issue 
if we issue debt securities that are redeemable at our option  we may choose to redeem the debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the debt securities 
in addition  if such debt securities are subject to mandatory redemption  we may be required to redeem the debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the debt securities 
in this circumstance  you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as your debt securities being redeemed 
credit ratings provided by third party credit rating agencies may not reflect all risks of an investment in debt securities that we may issue 
credit ratings provided by third party credit rating agencies are an assessment by third parties of our ability to pay our obligations 
consequently  real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of debt securities that we may issue 
credit ratings provided by third party credit rating agencies  however  may not reflect the potential impact of risks related to market conditions generally or other factors discussed above on the market value of or trading market for any publicly issued debt securities that we may issue 
subsequent sales in the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock by the selling stockholders may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  and the registration of a substantial amount of insider shares  whether or not actually sold  may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the availability of such common stock for sale  whether or not actually sold  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
if this occurs and continues  it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities should we desire to do so 
in addition  because shares owned by htf chf holdings llc  an entity that is primarily owned by certain of our officers  are being registered for resale  a negative perception could be created in the market about the company s prospects by such registration

the navs shown are based on outstanding shares at the end of each period 
calculated as of the respective high or low closing sales price divided by the quarter end nav 
represents the distribution paid in the specified quarter 
we have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a distribution  then stockholders cash distributions are automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions 
through march  from october  initial public offering to december  the last reported price for our common stock on march  was per share 
as of march  we had four stockholders of record  which did not include stockholders for whom shares are held in nominee or street name 
shares of bdcs may trade at market price that is less than the nav that is attributable to those shares 
the possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from nav or at a premium that is unsustainable over the long term is separate and distinct from the risk that our nav will decrease 
it is not possible to predict whether our shares will trade at  above or below nav in the future 
sales of unregistered securities we did not engage in any sales of unregistered securities during the year ended december  distributions we intend to continue making monthly distributions to our stockholders 
the timing and amount of our monthly distributions  if any  is determined by our board 
any distributions to our stockholders are declared out of assets legally available for distribution 
we monitor available net investment income to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the fiscal year 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed to be a return of capital to our common stockholders for us federal income tax purpose 
thus  the source of distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains 
stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a dividend payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains 
in order to qualify as a ric and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required under the code to distribute at least of our net ordinary income and net short term capital gains in excess of net long term capital losses  if any  to our stockholders on an annual basis 
we refer to such amount as the annual distribution requirement in this annual report on form k 
additionally  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and of our capital gain net income on an annual basis and any net ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we previously paid no us federal income tax to avoid a us federal excise tax 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including the possible loss of our qualification as a ric 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such undistributed income 
distributions of any such carryover taxable income must be made through a dividend declared the latter of the filing date of the final tax return related to the year in which such taxable income was generated or the th day of the ninth month following the taxable year  in order to count towards the satisfaction of the annual distribution requirement in the year in which such income was generated 
we can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and  if we issue senior securities  we may be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings 
see item business regulation taxation as a ric 
in january  the internal revenue service extended a revenue procedure that temporarily allows a ric to distribute its own stock as a dividend for the purpose of fulfilling its distribution requirements 
pursuant to this revenue procedure  a ric may treat a distribution of its own stock as a dividend if the stock is publicly traded on an established securities market  the distribution is declared on or before december  with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december  and each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the ric subject to a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders  which must be at least of the aggregate declared distribution 
if too many stockholders elect to receive cash  each stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash with the balance of the distribution paid in stock 
in no event will any stockholder electing to receive cash receive less than of his or her entire distribution in cash 
we have not elected to distribute stock as a dividend pursuant to this procedure  but reserve the right to do so if the provisions of this revenue procedure are available in future years 
we have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we make a distribution  then stockholders cash distributions are automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opts out of the dividend reinvestment plan 
if a stockholder opts out  that stockholder receives cash distributions 
although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of common stock are generally subject to us federal  state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions  stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan do not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements a summary of our significant contractual payment obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years after years borrowings     unfunded commitments    total     in the normal course of business  we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these consist primarily of unfunded commitments to extend credit  in the form of loans  to our portfolio companies 
unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet 
our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time 
as of december   we had unfunded commitments of approximately million 
these commitments will be subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the balance sheet financial instruments that we hold 
since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
in addition to the wells facility and fortress facility  we have certain commitments pursuant to our investment management agreement entered into with our advisor 
we have agreed to pay a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee 
payments under the investment management agreement are equal to a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average gross assets and a two part incentive fee 
we have also entered into a contract with our advisor to serve as our administrator 
payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our advisor s overhead in performing its obligation under the agreement  including rent  fees and other expenses inclusive of our allocable portion of the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our investment management agreement and our administration agreement 
distributions in order to qualify as a ric and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required under the code to distribute at least of our net ordinary income and net short term capital gains in excess of net long term capital losses  if any  to our stockholders on an annual basis 
additionally  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and of our capital gain net income on an annual basis and any net ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we previously paid no us federal income tax to avoid a us federal excise tax 
we intend to distribute monthly dividends to our stockholders as determined by our board 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a bdc under the act 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including the possible loss of our qualification as a ric 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes 
thus  the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains 
stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a dividend payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains 
we have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a distribution  then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out of our dividend reinvestment plan 
if a stockholder opts out  that stockholder will receive cash distributions 
although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to us federal  state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions  stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes 
related party transactions we have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties  including the following we entered into the investment management agreement with our advisor 
mr 
robert pomeroy  our chairman  is a manager of the advisor  and mr 
gerald michaud  our president  is a manager of our advisor 
our advisor provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day to day operations pursuant to our administration agreement 
we have entered into a license agreement with the predecessor of the advisor  pursuant to which it has granted us a non exclusive  royalty free license to use the name horizon technology finance 
our advisor may manage other investment vehicles advisor funds with the same investment strategy as us 
our advisor may provide us an opportunity to co invest with the advisor funds 
under the act  absent receipt of exemptive relief from the sec  we and our affiliates may be precluded from co investing in such investments 
accordingly  we may apply for exemptive relief which would permit us to co invest subject to certain conditions  including  without limitation  approval of such investments by both a majority of our directors who have no financial interest in such transaction and a majority of directors who are not interested directors as defined in the act 
critical accounting policies the discussion of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
in addition to the discussion below  we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following items as critical accounting policies 
valuation of investments investments are recorded at fair value 
our board determines the fair value of our portfolio investments 
we apply fair value to substantially all of our investments in accordance with relevant gaap  which establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements 
we have categorized our investments carried at fair value  based on the priority of the valuation technique  into a three level fair value hierarchy 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date 
the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether the product is new  whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions 
to the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
the three categories within the hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
our board determines the fair value of investments in good faith  based on the input of management  the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve month period under our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
the board conducts this valuation process at the end of each fiscal quarter  with approximately based on fair value of our valuation of portfolio companies that do not have a readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm 
income recognition interest on loan investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding 
interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments  the loan is placed on non accrual status and the recognition of interest income is discontinued 
interest payments received on loans that are on non accrual status are treated as reductions of principal until the principal is repaid 
we receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business  including advisory fees  commitment fees  amendment fees  non utilization fees and prepayment fees 
in a limited number of cases  we may also receive a non refundable deposit earned upon the termination of a transaction 
loan origination fees  net of certain direct origination costs  are deferred  and along with unearned income  are amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the loan 
fees for counterparty loan commitments with multiple loans are allocated to each loan based upon each loan s relative fair value 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  the amortization of the related fees and unearned income is discontinued until the loan is returned to accrual status 
certain loan agreements also require the borrower to make an etp that is accrued into income over the life of the loan to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected 
we will generally cease accruing the income if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the borrower to be able to pay all principal and interest due 
in connection with substantially all lending arrangements  we receive warrants to purchase shares of stock from the borrower 
we record the warrants as assets at estimated fair value on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model 
we consider the warrants loan fees and also record as unearned loan income on the grant date 
the unearned income is recognized as interest income over the contractual life of the related loan in accordance with our income recognition policy 
subsequent to loan origination  the warrants are also measured at fair value using the black scholes valuation model 
any adjustment to fair value is recorded through earnings as net unrealized gain or loss on warrants 
gains from the disposition of the warrants or stock acquired from the exercise of warrants are recognized as realized gains on warrants 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics 
in order to qualify as a ric  among other things  we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and we must timely distribute to our stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  for each year 
we  among other things  have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders  which will generally relieve us from us federal income taxes 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
to the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions  we will accrue excise tax  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned 
we evaluate tax positions taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold  or uncertain tax positions  are recorded as a tax expense in the current year 
it is our policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense 
we had no material uncertain tax positions at december  and recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  asu 
asu converges the fair value measurement guidance in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss 
some of the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements  while other amendments change a particular principle in existing guidance 
in addition  asu requires additional fair value disclosures 
we adopted asu in the quarter ended march item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the periods covered by our financial statements  the interest rates on the loans within our portfolio were mostly at fixed rates and we expect that our loans in the future will also have primarily fixed interest rates 
the initial commitments to lend to our portfolio companies are usually based on a floating libor index and typically have interest rates that are fixed at the time of the loan funding and remain fixed for the term of the loan 
assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of december  was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates may affect net income by more than over a one year horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market  credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above 
while our senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate  our credit facilities have a floating interest rate provision based on a libor index which resets daily  and we expect that any other credit facilities into which we enter in the future may have floating interest rate provisions 
we have used hedging instruments in the past to protect us against interest rate fluctuations and we may use them in the future 
such instruments may include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates 
because we currently fund  and will continue to fund  our investments with borrowings  our net income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which could reduce our net investment income
