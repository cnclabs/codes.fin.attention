item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources investments we generate income by investing funds in excess of those retained for claims paying obligations and insurance operations 
we conduct these investment activities through each of the insurance entities and uih 
we have and expect to retain investment advisors to advise us or manage the investment portfolio 
our investment committee reports overall investment results to our board of directors  at least on a quarterly basis 
our investment advisers may assist in such reports to the board of directors 
in recent years we have actively traded investment securities and other investments to supplement income derived from our insurance operations 
our investment trading strategy was primarily to maximize after tax investment income  and to obtain favorable risk adjusted real after tax investment returns to achieve long term growth of the insurance entities statutory surplus and consolidated stockholders equity 

table of contents as of december   the fair value of our consolidated investment portfolio was approximately million  comprised of the following in thousands type of investment as of december  cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and cash equivalents debt securities equity securities non hedging derivative liability  net other investments total our investment committee recently authorized management to engage deutsche bank  a leading global investment advisor specializing in the insurance industry  to manage our investment portfolio 
working with the investment advisor  we expect to transition the composition of our portfolio to a more traditional insurance company investment portfolio  which we expect will provide a more stable stream of investment income and reduce the effects of market volatility 
our investment objective is to maintain liquidity and minimize risk 
our investment strategy includes maintaining investments to support unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for our insurance subsidiaries in accordance with guidelines established by insurance regulators 
the investment activities of the insurance entities are subject to regulation and supervision by the oir 
see government regulation and initiatives below 
the insurance entities may only make investments that are consistent with regulatory guidelines  and our investment policies for the insurance entities correspondingly limit the amount of investment in  among other things  non investment grade fixed maturity securities including high yield bonds and total investments in preferred stock and common stock 
while we seek to appropriately limit the size and scope of investments in the uih portfolio  uih is not similarly restricted by florida law 
therefore  the investments made by uih may significantly differ from those made by the insurance entities 
we do not purchase securities on margin 
as of december   approximately of our trading portfolio is held by our insurance entities and is held by uih 
see note investments in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item below 
government regulation and initiatives florida insurance companies  such as the insurance entities  are subject to regulation and supervision by the oir 
the oir has broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers 
such powers relate  among other things  to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business  the licensing of agents through the florida department of financial services  the standards of solvency to be met and maintained  the nature of  and limitations on  investments  approval of policy forms and rates  review of reinsurance contracts  periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies  and the form and content of required financial statements 
such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of policyholders and not for the benefit of investors 
florida created the citizens property insurance corporation citizens to provide insurance to florida homeowners in high risk areas and to others without private insurance options 
as of february   there were  citizens policies in force compared to  as of january  in may  florida passed legislation that froze property insurance rates for citizens customers at december levels through december   and permits insurance customers to opt into citizens when the price of a privately offered insurance policy is more than the citizens rate  compared to the previous opt in threshold of 
these initiatives  together with any future initiatives that seek to further relax eligibility requirements or reduce premium rates for citizens customers  could adversely affect our ability and the ability of the insurance entities to conduct profitable business 
in addition  the florida legislature in expanded the capacity of the fhcf  with the intent of reducing the cost of reinsurance otherwise purchased by residential property insurers 
state and federal legislation relating to insurance is affected by a number of political and economic factors that are beyond our control 
the florida legislature and the national association of insurance commissioners naic from time to time consider proposals that may affect  among other things  regulatory assessments and reserve requirements 

table of contents in addition  the insurance entities are required to offer wind mitigation discounts in accordance with a program mandated by the florida legislature and implemented by the oir 
the level of wind mitigation discounts mandated by the florida legislature to be effective june  for new business and august  for renewal business have had a significant negative effect on upcic s premium 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the impact of wind mitigation discounts on our results of operations 
the florida insurance guaranty association figa is a nonprofit corporation created by the florida legislature 
figa services pending claims by or against florida policyholders of member insurance companies which become insolvent and are ordered liquidated 
the operation is directed towards early recognition and payment of those covered claims which must be resolved to avoid hardship or financial difficulties to the insureds or claimants involved 
payments of claims are funded through assessments that are made among members which are composed of all florida licensed direct writers of property or casualty insurance 
a mandatory assessment was made by figa applicable to all member insurers of figa s all other account  which includes upcic and appcic 
collectively  the assessment was percent of the insurance entities net direct written premiums within florida for the calendar year and totaled million 
the assessment had a negative effect on the consolidated operating results of the company for the year ended december  the mandatory assessment on upcic of million will be recovered through a surcharge on upcic s policies within florida  pursuant to a filing made with the florida oir november  and the company expects it will have a positive effect on operating results over an estimated twelve month period which began on february  the mandatory assessment on appcic was a nominal amount that the company has elected not to recover 
since the last assessment levied by figa in on its all other account  figa reports there have been thirteen foreign and domestic insurance company insolvencies affecting its claims paying accounts 
upcic has become and will become subject to other states laws and regulations as it has obtained and continues to seek authority to transact business in other states 
product pricing the rates charged by the insurance entities generally are subject to regulatory review and approval before they may be implemented 
the insurance entities periodically submit their rate revisions to regulators as required by law or deemed by us to be necessary or appropriate for the insurance entities business 
we prepare these filings for the insurance entities based on objective data relating to their business and on judgment exercised by management and by retained professionals 
the premiums charged by the insurance entities to policyholders are affected by legislative enactments and administrative rules  including a state mandated program requiring residential property insurance companies like ours to provide premium discounts when policyholders verify that insured properties have certain construction features or other windstorm loss reduction features 
the level of required premium discounts may exceed the expected reduction in losses associated with the construction features for which the discounts are provided 
although the insurance entities may submit rate filings to address any premium deficiencies  those rate filings are subject to regulatory oversight and may not be approved 
on january   we announced that upcic received oir approval for premium rate increases for its homeowners and dwelling fire programs within florida 
the premium rate increases are expected to average approximately statewide for its homeowners program and statewide for its dwelling fire program 
the effective dates for both of the premium rate increases are january  for new business and february  for renewal business 
upcic made a forms filing immediately after the rate filing to segregate sinkhole coverage and to include updated policy language as a result of the property insurance bill which became law in may senate bill 
the oir approved the forms filing with effective dates of april  for new business and may  for renewals 
with the approval of this forms filing  sinkhole coverage will be excluded from certain base homeowners policies but the coverage will be offered via endorsement for an additional surcharge  and a mandatory deductible  to those policyholders that meet the proposed eligibility standards 
revised inspection and eligibility requirements will not be imposed upon existing policyholders who elect to continue sinkhole coverage at their policy renewal 
form changes for sinkhole coverage on dwelling fire policies  which are similar in nature to those filed for homeowners policies  were approved by the oir with effective dates of may  for new business and june  for renewal business 
coverage for catastrophic ground cover collapse will remain a covered peril under all standard policy forms 
on july   we announced that upcic received approval from the massachusetts division of insurance for homeowners policies rates and forms 
on september   we announced that upcic received approval from the maryland insurance administration for homeowners policies rates and forms 
on february   we announced that upcic received approval from the oir for premium rate increases for its homeowners and dwelling fire programs within florida 
the premium rate increases will average approximately statewide for its homeowners program and for its dwelling fire program 
the effective dates for the homeowners program rate increase are january   for new business and march   for renewal business 
the effective dates for the dwelling fire program rate increase are january   for new business and march   for renewal business 
competition the insurance industry is highly competitive and many companies currently write homeowners property and casualty insurance 
additionally  we must compete with companies that have greater capital resources and longer operating histories 
increased competition from other private insurance companies as well as citizens could adversely affect our ability to conduct profitable business 
in addition  our financial stability rating is an important factor in establishing our competitive position and may affect our sales 
although our pricing is inevitably influenced to some degree by that of our competitors  we believe that it is generally not in our best interest to compete solely on price  choosing instead to compete on the basis of underwriting criteria  our distribution network and high quality service to our agents and insureds

item a 
risk factors we are subject to a variety of risks  the most significant of which are described below 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks 
risks relating to the property casualty business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  tropical storms and certain types of terrorism 
we may incur catastrophe losses in excess of those experienced in prior years  or estimated by a catastrophe model we use  the average expected level used in pricing  and our current reinsurance coverage limits 

table of contents in addition  we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of property claims when severe weather conditions occur 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to our operations 
in addition  impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth 
although we use  what we believe to be  widely recognized and commercially available models to estimate hurricane loss exposure  other models exist that might produce higher or lower loss estimates 
the loss estimates developed by the catastrophe model are dependent upon assumptions or scenarios incorporated into the model by a third party developer and by us or our representatives 
however if these assumptions or scenarios do not reflect the characteristics of future catastrophic events that affect florida or the resulting economic conditions  such may result in exposure for losses not covered by our reinsurance program 
despite our catastrophe management programs  we retain significant exposure to catastrophic events 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses and have a negative impact on our business 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability 
changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
although we pursue various loss management initiatives in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
we may experience declines in claim frequency from time to time 
the short term level of claim frequency we experience may vary from period to period and may not be sustainable over the longer term 
a significant long term increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition recorded claim reserves in the property casualty business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr  after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  pending levels of unpaid claims and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
predicting claim expense relating to environmental liabilities is inherently uncertain and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition the process of estimating environmental liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are  or were ever intended to be covered  and whether losses could be recoverable through reinsurance 
litigation is a complex  lengthy process that involves substantial uncertainty for insurers 
actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating environmental net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
ultimate net losses from environmental liabilities could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure  such as engaging in rigorous underwriting  carefully evaluating terms and conditions of our policies  and ceding risk to reinsurers 

table of contents however  there are inherent limitations in all of these tactics and no assurance can be given that an event or series of events will not result in loss levels in excess of our probable maximum loss models  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
it is also possible that losses could manifest themselves in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address 
such a manifestation of losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
these risks may be heightened during difficult economic conditions such as those currently being experienced in florida and elsewhere 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business our reinsurance program was designed  utilizing our risk management methodology  to address our exposure to catastrophes 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
for example  our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for our cost  and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available next year 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to participate in loss sharing may decrease our profitability from time to time  political dispositions affect the insurance market  including efforts to effectively suppress rates at a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
despite efforts to remove politics from insurance regulation  facts and history demonstrate that public policymakers  when faced with untoward events and adverse public sentiment  can act in ways that impede a satisfactory correlation between rates and risk 
such acts may affect our ability to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to attain rate adequacy along with targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for our cost 
additionally  we are required to participate in guaranty funds for insolvent insurance companies 
the funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of implementing our profitability model may not be fully realized we believe that our profitability model has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because many of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and sophisticated models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  our competitive advantage could decline or be lost 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our profitability model 
furthermore  we cannot be assured that the profitability model will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the business generated 
our financial condition and operating results and the financial condition and operating results of our insurance entities may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
renewed weakness in the florida real estate market could adversely affect our loss results as of december   approximately of our policies in force and of total insured values were derived from customers located in florida 
in recent years  florida experienced a significant economic downturn and among the highest real estate value diminution in the country 
while the real estate market in florida appears to be on the rebound  renewed weakness in that market could result in fewer home sales  which may adversely affect the number of policies we are able to sell and or the rates we are able to charge to customers 
additionally  higher incidents of foreclosed or vacant homes may result in increased claims activity under residential insurance policies  which could negatively impact our operating results 

table of contents risks relating to investments we have periodically experienced  and may experience further reductions in returns or losses on our investments especially during periods of heightened volatility  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition our investment strategy may subject our investment portfolio to significant volatility 
the returns on our investment portfolio may be reduced or we may incur losses as a result of changes in general economic conditions  interest rates  real estate markets  fixed income markets  metals markets  energy markets  agriculture markets  equity markets  alternative investment markets  credit markets  exchange rates  global capital market conditions and numerous other factors that are beyond our control 
the worldwide financial markets experience high levels of volatility during certain periods  which could have an increasingly adverse impact on the us and foreign economies 
the financial market volatility and any resulting negative economic impact could continue and be prolonged  which could adversely affect our current investment portfolio  make it difficult to determine the value of certain assets in our portfolio and or make it difficult for us to purchase suitable investments that meet our risk and return criteria 
these factors could cause us to realize less than expected returns on invested assets  sell investments for a loss or write off or write down investments  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to market risk which may adversely impact investment income our primary market risk exposures are changes in equity and commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currencies 
a decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than our portfolio s average rate of return 
a decline could also lead us to purchase longer term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a portion of our investment portfolio 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities 
concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition the concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular industry  collateral types  group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition 
events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio are concentrated rather than diversified 
our overall financial performance is dependent in part on the returns on our investment portfolio  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause such results to be volatile the performance of our investment portfolio is independent of the revenue and income generated from our insurance operations  and there is no direct correlation between the financial results of these two activities 
thus  to the extent that our investment portfolio does not perform well due to the factors discussed above or otherwise  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected even if our insurance operations perform favorably 
further  because the returns on our investment trading portfolio may be volatile  our overall results of operations may likewise be volatile from period to period even if we do not experience significant financial variances in our insurance operations 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions  in developing the talent and skills of our human resources  in assimilating new executive talent into our organization  or in deploying human resource talent consist with our business goals 
difficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results the united states economy has experienced widespread job losses  higher unemployment  lower consumer spending  declines in home prices and substantial increases in delinquencies on consumer debt  including defaults on home mortgages 
moreover  past disruptions in the financial markets  particularly the reduced availability of credit and tightened lending requirements  have affected the ability of borrowers to refinance loans at more affordable rates 
we cannot predict the likelihood of a future recession  but as with most businesses  we believe a longer or more severe recession could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents a general economic slowdown could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure on our investment portfolio 
consumer behavior could include decreased demand for insurance 
in and  weakness in the housing market and a highly competitive environment contributed to reduced growth in policies in force 
our investment portfolio could be adversely affected as a result of deteriorating financial and business conditions 
there can be no assurance that actions of the us federal government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets and stimulating the economy will achieve the intended effect in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system  the financial markets and the broader economy  the us government  the federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking action to address such conditions including  among other things  purchasing mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions  investing directly in banks  thrifts and financial institution holding companies and increasing federal spending to stimulate the economy 
there can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets or on economic conditions 
such continued volatility and economic deterioration could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as an insurance company  we are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
moreover  they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  the sec  the us department of justice  and state attorneys general  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products  not holders of securities issued by us 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination by state insurance departments the insurance entities are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which they do business 
state insurance regulatory agencies conduct periodic examinations of the insurance entities on a wide variety of matters  including policy forms  premium rates  licensing  trade and claims practices  investment standards and practices  statutory capital and surplus requirements  reserve and loss ratio requirements and transactions among affiliates 
further  the insurance entities are required to file annual and other reports with state insurance regulatory agencies relating to financial condition  holding company issues and other matters 
if an insurance company fails to obtain required licenses or approvals  or if the insurance entities fail to comply with other regulatory requirements  the regulatory agencies can suspend or delay their operations or licenses  require corrective action and impose operating limitations  penalties or other remedies available under applicable laws and regulations 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded risks  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the risk we insure  although it does make the reinsurer liable to us in the event of a claim 
as such  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including changes in market conditions  whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio the continued threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism 
additionally  in the event that terrorist acts occur  we could be adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
a downgrade in our financial stability rating may have an adverse effect on our competitive position  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition financial stability ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a change in a rating agency s determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  a change in the perceived adequacy of an insurers reinsurance program  an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer s investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under an insurer s control 
the current insurance financial stability rating of upcic is from demotech  inc the assigned rating is a 
because this rating is subject to continuous review  the retention of this rating cannot be assured 
a downgrade in or withdrawal of this rating  or a decision by demotech to require upcic s parent company to make a capital infusion into upcic to maintain its rating  may adversely affect our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity 
in the event that we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses  make payments on our indebtedness  pay for capital expenditures or fund acquisitions  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  and credit capacity  as well as lenders perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain financing on favorable terms 
changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  profitability or cash flows property and casualty insurers are subject to claims arising from catastrophes 
catastrophic losses have had a significant impact on our historical results 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  tsunamis  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  flooding  severe winter weather and fires and may include man made events  such as terrorist attacks 
the incidence  frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
longer term weather trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change  a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures  including effects on global weather patterns  greenhouse gases  sea  land and air temperature  sea levels  rain and snow 
the science regarding climate change is still emerging and developing 
however  to the extent the frequency or severity of weather events is exacerbated due to climate change  we may experience increases in catastrophe losses in both coastal and non coastal areas 
loss of key executives could affect our operations on february   our former chairman  president and chief executive officer bradley i 
meier resigned from his positions with the company to pursue opportunities outside the residential homeowners insurance industry 
our future operations will depend in large part on the efforts of our new chairman and chief executive officer  sean p 
downes  and on the efforts of our new chief operating officer  jon w 
springer  both of whom have served in executive roles at the company or its affiliates for many years 
the loss of the services provided by mr 
meier  along with any future loss of the services provided by mr 
downes or mr 
springer  could have a material adverse effect on the company and on our financial condition and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of uih 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and accompanying notes in part ii  item below 
overview uih is a vertically integrated insurance holding company performing all aspects of insurance underwriting  distribution and claims 
through our wholly owned subsidiaries  including the insurance entities  we are principally engaged in the property and casualty insurance business offered primarily through a network of independent agents 
our underwriting criteria includes  but is not limited to  the use of specific policy forms  coverage amounts on buildings and contents and required compliance with local building codes 
also  to improve underwriting and manage risk  we utilize standard industry modeling techniques for hurricane and windstorm exposure 
our primary product is homeowners insurance  which we currently offer in seven states including florida  which represented of the thousand policies in force as of december   and of the thousand policies in force as of december  approximately of our policies in force as of december  and included wind coverage 

table of contents the following table provides the percentage of concentrations with respect to the insurance entities nationwide policies in force as of the periods presented december  december  percentage of policies in force in florida with wind coverage with wind coverage in south florida south florida is comprised of miami dade  broward and palm beach counties 
we generate revenues primarily from the collection of premiums and the investment of those premiums 
other significant sources of revenue include commissions collected from reinsurers and policy fees 
investment portfolio we seek to generate income through the investment activities conducted by each of the insurance entities and uih 
our investment strategy is intended to support our overall business strategy and supplement income derived from our insurance underwriting activities 
thus  our operating results are dependent in part upon the results of our investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of net losses on our trading portfolio  compared to million of net losses for the year ended december  the losses in our trading portfolio in reflect a particularly steep decline in the value of our equity securities holdings occurring mostly during the second half of the year 
as discussed under item business investments 
our investment committee recently authorized management to engage deutsche bank  a leading global third party investment advisor specializing in the insurance industry  to manage our investment portfolio 
working with the investment advisor  we expect to transition the composition of our portfolio to a more traditional insurance company investment portfolio which we expect will provide a more stable stream of investment income and reduce the effects of market volatility 
we currently anticipate the majority of the portfolio will be available for sale with changes in fair value reflected in stockholders equity with the exception of any other than temporary impairments which are reflected in earnings 

table of contents recent developments as we have previously noted  we are subject to extensive regulation and regulatory examination 
the insurance entities are now at varying stages of financial or market conduct examination by the oir 
such examination and review may identify compliance issues that ultimately result in the oir alleging violations of florida insurance regulations or recommending areas of operational changes or improvements 
the insurance entities are in regular conversation with the oir and are provided opportunities to respond to any such allegations or suggested changes 
for more information about the potential impact of regulations and examinations on our operations  see the headings we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination by state insurance departments under risk factors in item a  beginning on page effective february   bradley i 
meier resigned as chairman  president and chief executive officer of the company to pursue opportunities outside the residential homeowners insurance industry 
also effective february   sean p 
downes became the president and chief executive officer of the company and jon w 
springer became the senior vice president and chief operating officer of the company 
impact of new accounting pronouncement we prospectively adopted new accounting guidance in the first quarter of related to accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
under the new guidance  net deferred policy acquisition costs were reduced from million to million  a difference of at december  the resulting million difference was charged directly to earnings during the three months ended march  this charge represents an acceleration of deferred charges in the period of adoption  which would have ultimately been recognized within a twelve month period 
reinsurance program effective june   we entered into multiple reinsurance agreements comprising our reinsurance program 
reinsurance generally in the normal course of business  we limit the maximum net loss that can arise from large risks  risks in concentrated areas of exposure and catastrophes  such as hurricanes or other similar loss occurrences  by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurers or reinsurers through our reinsurance agreements 
our intention is to limit our exposure and the exposure of the insurance entities  thereby protecting stockholders equity and the insurance entities capital and surplus  even in the event of catastrophic occurrences  through reinsurance agreements 
without these reinsurance agreements  the insurance entities would be more substantially exposed to catastrophic losses with a greater likelihood that those losses could exceed their statutory capital and surplus 
any such catastrophic event  or multiple catastrophes  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance entities solvency and our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
below is a description of our reinsurance program 
although the terms of the individual contracts vary  we believe the overall terms of the reinsurance program are more favorable than the reinsurance program as reinsurance pricing remained largely the same as the prior year contracts while direct earned premium is expected to increase as a result of the previously approved and expected future rate increases 
we also reduced the percentage of premiums ceded by upcic to its quota share reinsurer to under the reinsurance program which became effective june   from under the prior year quota share contract effective june  through may  our intent is to increase profitability over the contract term by ceding less premium to our quota share reinsurer 
this reduction of cession rate also decreases the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses that may be ceded by upcic and effectively increases the amount of risk we retain 
the reduction of cession rate also reduces the amount of ceding commissions earned from our quota share reinsurer during the contract term 
we also eliminated the loss corridor and the cap on loss adjustment expenses in the quota share contract effective june  
table of contents the insurance entities are responsible for insured losses related to catastrophic events in excess of coverage provided by their reinsurance programs 
the insurance entities also remain responsible for insured losses in the event of the failure of any reinsurer to make payments otherwise due to the insurance entities 
the insurance entities inability to satisfy valid insurance claims resulting from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
upcic reinsurance program effective june   upcic entered into a quota share reinsurance contract with odyssey reinsurance company 
under the quota share contract  through may   upcic cedes of its gross written premiums  losses and loss adjustment expenses for policies with coverage for wind risk with a ceding commission equal to of ceded gross written premiums 
in addition  the quota share contract has a limitation for any one occurrence not to exceed million of which upcic s net liability on the first million of losses in a first event scenario is million  in a second event scenario is million and in a third event scenario is million and a limitation from losses arising out of events that are assigned a catastrophe serial number by the property claims services pcs office not to exceed million 
the contract limits the amount of premium which can be deducted for inuring reinsurance to the lesser of actual costs or of gross earned premium  excluding reinstatement premiums  or the lesser of actual costs or of gross earned premium plus a maximum additional of million including reinstatement premiums  if any 
effective june  through may   upcic entered into a multiple line excess per risk contract with various reinsurers 
under the multiple line excess per risk contract  upcic obtained coverage of million in excess of thousand ultimate net loss for each risk and each property loss  and million in excess of thousand for each casualty loss 
the contract has a limitation for any one occurrence not to exceed million and a million aggregate limit that applies to the term of the contract 
effective june  through may   upcic entered into a property per risk excess contract covering ex wind only policies

upcic entered into this contract with a segregated account  segregated account t universal insurance holdings of white rock insurance sac ltd 
t  which is owned by uih and was established by a third party reinsurer under bermuda law 
under this t agreement  t retains a maximum  pre tax liability of million for the first catastrophic event up to billion of losses 
upcic is required to make premium installment payments aggregating million to t  subject to the terms of the agreement 
through capital contributions made to t by uih  t contributes an amount equal to its liability for losses  net of upcic s required premium payments and expenses thereon  to a trust account as collateral 
the trust account is funded with the required collateral and invested in a cash reserve fund 
the amounts held in the cash reserve fund are included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets 
the collateral is available to be used to pay any claims that may arise from the occurrence of covered events 
the collateral is required to be held in trust for the benefit of upcic until the occurrence of a covered event or expiration or termination of the agreement between t and upcic 
uih has no requirement to fund t in the event losses exceed the amount of collateral held in trust 
uih has secured the obligations of the segregated account by contributing the amount of the segregated account s liability for losses  net of upcic s required premium payments  to a trust account for the current june  to may  contract period 
in the event of a loss under the terms of this contract  the capital contributed by uih would be used to pay claims and would have an adverse effect on stockholders equity and cash resources 
the agreements between t and the insurance entities are a cost effective alternative to reinsurance that the insurance entities would otherwise purchase from third party reinsurers 
while we retain the risk that otherwise would be transferred to third party reinsurers  these agreements provide benefits to the insurance entities in no loss years that cannot be replicated in the open reinsurance market 
these benefits include the return to the insurance entities of a substantial portion of the earned reinsurance premiums under the contract 
all the related intercompany transactions with respect to these agreements are eliminated in consolidation

reinsurance agreements between t and the insurance entities are generally terminated on or about may and december each year and replaced with similarly structured agreements or with agreements with third party reinsurers effective june and january  respectively 
the terminations effective may are intended to coordinate and integrate the replacement contracts into the insurance entities overall reinsurance program and the related changes to limits and retention levels for the subsequent contract year ie  june through may 
the terminations effective december are intended to provide the aforementioned benefit of return premium to the insurance entities 
the t agreement effective june  through may  was terminated effective december   pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
in connection with the termination of the agreement  the affiliates agreed to release funds held in trust due to the beneficiary ie  the insurance entities and the balance to the grantor ie  uih in december we continually evaluate strategies to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophe losses  including the maintenance of catastrophic reinsurance coverage 
effective january   the t contract was subsequently replaced  at identical limits and retentions as the prior agreement  with unaffiliated third party reinsurers as an open market purchase 
effective january  through may   under an excess catastrophe contract  upcic obtained catastrophe coverage of of million in excess of million and of million in excess of million covering certain loss occurrences including hurricanes 
the total cost of this reinsurance coverage is million

wind mitigation discounts the insurance premiums charged by the insurance entities are subject to various statutory and regulatory requirements 
among these  the insurance entities must offer wind mitigation discounts in accordance with a program mandated by the florida legislature and implemented by the oir 
the level of wind mitigation discounts mandated by the florida legislature to be effective june  for new business and august  for renewal business have had a significant negative effect on the insurance entities premium

although insurers may seek to rectify any problems through subsequent rate increase filings with the oir  there is no assurance that the oir and the insurers will agree on the amount of rate change that is needed 
in addition  any adjustments to the insurers rates similarly take more than months to be fully integrated into the insurers business 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our primary areas of estimate are described below 
recognition of premium revenues 
property and liability premiums are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the policy term 
the portion of premiums that will be earned in the future are deferred and reported as unearned premiums 
management believes that its revenue recognition policies conform to staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
liability for unpaid losses and lae 
a liability is established to provide for the estimated costs of paying losses and lae under insurance policies the insurance entities have issued 
underwriting results are significantly influenced by an estimate of a liability for unpaid losses and lae 
the liability is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the financial statement date 
characteristics of reserves 
reserves are established based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims  less losses that have been paid 
claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported 
upcic s claim settlement data suggests that homeowners property losses have an average settlement time of less than one year  while homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle 

table of contents reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims 
we update reserve estimates periodically as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates reserve re estimates  which may be material  are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates  and the differences are recorded as losses and lae in the consolidated statements of income in the period such changes are determined 
estimating the ultimate cost of losses and lae is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables 
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates 
reserves for losses and lae are determined in three separate steps 
these steps are the estimation of reserves for non catastrophe loss and defense and cost containment dcc expenses hereafter referred to simply as losses  estimation of reserves for hurricane experience  and estimation of reserves for adjusting and other ao expenses 
these three steps are further separated into the analysis of data groupings of like exposure 
these groups are property damage on homeowner policy forms ho and ho combined  property damage on homeowner policy forms ho and ho combined  dwelling fire property damage  all homeowner liability exposure  other liability the optional liability coverage offered to dwelling fire policyholders  and all hurricane experience combined 
reserve estimates for non catastrophe losses are derived using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique 
that actuarial technique is known as a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters for an accident year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
this technique forms the basis of the six actuarial methods described below 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred  regardless of the date it was reported to the insurance entities 
this analysis is used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
the key data elements used to determine our reserve estimates include claim counts  paid losses  paid dcc  case reserves  and the related development factors applicable to this data 
the first method for estimating unpaid amounts for non hurricane losses is the reported development method 
this method is based upon the assumption that the relative change in a given year s reported loss estimates from one evaluation point to the next is similar to the relative change in prior years reported loss estimates at similar evaluation points 
in utilizing this method  actual annual historical reported loss data is evaluated 
successive years can be arranged to form a triangle of data 
report to report rtr development factors are calculated to measure the change in cumulative reported losses from one evaluation point to the next 
these historical rtr factors form the basis for selecting the rtr factors used in projecting the current valuation of losses to an ultimate basis 
in addition  a tail factor is selected to account for loss development beyond the observed experience 
the tail factor is based on trends shown in the data and consideration of industry loss development benchmarks 
this method s implicit assumption is that the relative adequacy of case reserves has been consistent over time  and that there have been no material changes in the rate at which claims have been reported 
the second method is the paid development method 
this method is similar to the reported development method  however  case reserves are excluded from the analysis 
while this method has the disadvantage of not recognizing the information provided by current case reserves  it has the advantage of avoiding potential distortions in the data due to changes in case reserving methodology 
this method s implicit assumption is that the rate of payment of claims has been relatively consistent over time 
the third method is the reported bornhuetter ferguson b f method 
this method is essentially a blend of two other methods 
the first method is the loss development method described above  whereby actual reported losses are multiplied by an expected loss development factor 
for slow reporting coverages  the loss development method can lead to erratic and unreliable projections  because a relatively small swing in early reporting periods can result in a large swing in ultimate projections 
the second method is the expected loss method a description of the expected loss method follows the description of the reported b f method  whereby the ibnr estimate equals the difference between predetermined estimates of expected losses and actual reported losses 
this has the advantage of stability  but it does not respond to actual results as they emerge 
the reported b f method combines these two methods by setting ultimate losses equal to actual reported losses plus expected unreported losses 
as an experience year matures and expected unreported losses become smaller  the initial expected loss assumption becomes gradually less important 
two parameters are needed to apply the b f method the initial expected loss ratio and the expected reporting pattern 
the initial expected loss ratio for each accident year other than the current year is set equal to the estimated ultimate loss ratio from the prior analysis 
the initial expected loss ratio for the current year is determined based on trends in historical ratios  rate changes  and underlying loss trends 
the expected reporting pattern is based on the reported loss development method described above 
this method is often used for long tail lines and in situations where the reported loss experience is relatively immature or lacks sufficient credibility for the application of other methods 

table of contents as mentioned above  one component of the b f method is the expected loss method 
in this method  ultimate loss projections are based upon some prior measure of the anticipated losses  usually relative to some measure of exposure  such as premiums  revenues  or payroll 
an expected loss ratio or loss cost pure premium is applied to the measure of exposure to determine estimated ultimate losses for each year 
actual losses are not considered in this calculation 
this method has the advantage of stability over time because the ultimate loss estimates do not change unless the exposures or pure premiums change 
however  this advantage of stability is offset by a lack of responsiveness  since this method does not consider actual loss experience as it emerges 
this method is based on the assumption that the pure premium per unit of exposure is a good indication of ultimate losses 
it is entirely dependent on pricing assumptions 
the fourth method is the paid b f method 
this method is analogous to the reported b f method using paid losses and development patterns in place of reported losses and patterns 
the fifth method is the reported counts and averages method 
in this method  an estimate of unpaid losses is determined by separately projecting ultimate reported claim counts and ultimate reported claim severities cost per reported claim for each accident period 
typically  loss development methods are used to project ultimate claim counts and claim severities based on historical data using the same methodology described in the reported development method above 
estimated ultimate losses are then calculated as the product of the two items 
this method is intended to avoid data distortions that may exist with the other methods for the most recent years as a result of changes in case reserve levels  settlement rates  etc 
in addition  it may provide insight into the drivers of loss experience 
the sixth method is the paid counts and averages method 
this method is analogous to the reported counts and averages method using paid claims counts and paid claim severities and their related development patterns in place of reported data 
in selecting the rtr development factors described above  due consideration is given to how the rtr development factors change from one year to the next over the course of several consecutive years of recent history 
in addition to the loss development triangles cited above  various diagnostic triangles  such as triangles showing historical patterns in the ratio of paid to reported losses and paid to reported claim counts are typically prepared as a means of determining the stability of various determinants of loss development  such as consistency in claims settlement and case reserving 
the implicit assumption of these techniques is that the selected rtr factors combine to form loss development patterns that are predictive of future loss development 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process  the implicit assumption being that the selected development factors includes an adequate provision 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  an unusually large amount of catastrophe losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
the six methods described above all produce an estimate of ultimate losses 
based on the results of these six methods  a single estimate commonly referred to as an actuarial point central estimate of the ultimate loss is selected 
estimated ibnr reserves are determined by subtracting the reported loss from the selected ultimate loss 
the estimated ibnr reserves are added to case reserves to determine the total estimated unpaid losses 
estimates of unpaid losses for hurricane experience are not developed using company specific development patterns  due to the relatively infrequent nature of storms and the high severity typically associated with them 
both the reported development method and the paid development method were used to estimate ultimate losses 
however  the development patterns were based on industry data determined by our consulting actuary 
there is an inherent assumption that relying on industry development patterns as opposed to company specific patterns produces more credible results for projecting hurricane losses 
estimated unpaid amounts for non catastrophe ao expenses are determined as the product of the estimated number of outstanding claims whether open or unreported times an estimate of average ao per claim 
universal s claims are handled by uac  a wholly owned subsidiary 
the procedure we followed was to begin by developing a history of average ao expenses per closed claim whether with or without payment for each line of business 
since average fees have increased dramatically in the last two years  we placed reliance primarily on the indications from those two years in making our selections 
the selected average ao expense was then multiplied by the estimated number of claims to be closed in the future whether with or without payment to determine an estimated liability 
the estimated number of claims to be closed in the future was determined by projecting reported claims for each accident year to an estimated ultimate basis using the traditional development factor method  then subtracting the total number of claims that had been closed as of the end of the calendar year whether with or without payment 
in the case of the ao liabilities associated with hurricane exposure  a similar procedure was used to determine an estimate of the average ao expense per closed claim as was used for the non catastrophe ao liabilities 
however  a different procedure was used to estimate the number of claims to be closed in the future since the reported claim count development method would not produce a 
table of contents reliable estimate of ultimate hurricane claims 
three separate estimates of outstanding claims were determined 
in one method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where claim severity was estimated as the ratio of paid losses to closed claims 
in the second method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where estimated claim severity was determined as the ratio of reported losses to reported claims 
in the third method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where claim severity was determined as the ratio of case reserves to open claims 
based on these three methods a final selection was made on estimated outstanding claim counts 
the final selection is multiplied by estimated average ao expense per claim to derive the estimated liability 
how reserve estimates are established and updated 
reserve estimates are developed for both open claims and ibnr claims 
the actuarial methods described above are used to derive claim settlement patterns by determining development factors to be applied to specific data elements 
development factors are calculated for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled  paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves 
the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates 
often  different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves are summed to create the reserve balance carried on our consolidated balance sheets 
reserves are re estimated periodically  by combining historical payment and reserving patterns with current actual results 
when actual development of claims reported  paid losses or case reserve changes are different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate  a new reserve is determined 
this process incorporates the historic and latest trends  and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates 
the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and the previously recorded estimate of reserves is the amount of reserve re estimate 
the resulting increase or decrease in the reserve re estimate is recorded and included in losses and loss adjustment expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
total reserve re estimates in  and  expressed as a percent of the net losses and lae liability balance as of the beginning of each year  were  and  respectively 
it should be noted that there are inherent uncertainties associated with this estimation process  especially for a company with limited development history 
with the passing of each year  the company s own historical trends have become more reliable for use in predicting future results 
reserve re estimates for were primarily the result of actual loss development on prior year non catastrophe losses and higher than expected adjusting and other expenses 
reserve re estimates on non catastrophe losses are a result of settling homeowner s losses established in the prior year for amounts that were more than expected 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on indications of updated development factor calculations 
reserve re estimates for catastrophe losses  which are associated with the high level of uncertainty related to hurricane claims are described under catastrophe losses below 
factors affecting reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends as previously described 
these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  differing payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  changes in law and regulation  judicial decisions  and economic conditions 
when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned  we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends  such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors 
for example  if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate 
another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to property  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development 
as claims are reported  for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity  the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost  based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim 
for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame  it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim  and an initial case reserve of  is set for these claims 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors 
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss  it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility 
from that point in time and forward  reserves are re estimated using statistical actuarial processes 
table of contents to reflect the impact loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes 
statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year  however  when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner  they are usually given credibility  and reserves are increased accordingly 
key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and lae relate to the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
key assumptions that are premised on future emergence that are inconsistent with historical loss reserve development patterns include but are not limited to adverse changes in loss cost trends  including inflationary pressures in home repair costs  judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability  and plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers  in purported class action litigation related to claims handling and other practices 
by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for homeowner losses  we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors  as described in the section titled  potential reserve estimate variability below 
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty 
since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate 
at each reporting date  the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year and claims that have occurred but have not been reported pure ibnr claims 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
most of these losses are related to homes that were damaged 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest re estimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving litigation 
reserves for catastrophe losses 
loss and lae reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property casualty insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
a catastrophe is an event that produces significant pre tax losses before reinsurance and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  tornadoes  wildfires  tropical storms and hurricanes 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described previously 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  as noted above  the estimation process can be further complicated 
for example  for hurricanes  complications could include the inability of insureds to be able to promptly report losses  limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses  determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain  or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood  estimating additional living expenses  and assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations  including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events  such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period  which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period 
in these situations  we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe 
key actuarial assumptions that affect the loss and lae estimate 
the aggregation of estimates for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes  actuarial techniques are applied to the data elements for paid losses and reported losses separately for homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses and catastrophe losses to estimate the potential variability of our reserves  within a reasonable probability of outcomes 

table of contents at any given point in time  our loss reserve represents our best estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration cost of our insured claims incurred and unpaid 
since the process of estimating loss reserves requires significant judgment due to a number of variables  such as fluctuations in inflation  judicial decisions  legislative changes and changes in claims handling procedures  our ultimate liability may exceed or be less than these estimates 
we revise reserves for losses and lae as additional information becomes available  and reflect adjustments  if any  in earnings in the periods in which they are determined 
on an annual basis  our independent actuary provides a statement of actuarial opinion sao that certifies the carried reserves make a reasonable provision for all of the insurance entities unpaid loss and lae obligations under the terms of our contracts and agreements with our policyholders 
we review the sao and compare the projected ultimate losses and lae per the sao to our own projection of ultimate losses and lae to ensure that loss and lae reserves recorded at each annual balance sheet date are based upon our analysis of all internal and external factors related to known and unknown claims against us 
we compare our recorded reserves to the indicated range provided in the report accompanying the sao 
at december   the recorded amount for net loss and lae falls within the range determined by our independent actuaries and approximates their best estimate 
in selecting the rtr development factors described above in the section titled the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates  due consideration is given to how the rtr development factors change from one year to the next over the course of several consecutive years of recent history 
in addition to the loss development triangles cited above  various diagnostic triangles  such as triangles showing historical patterns in the ratio of paid to reported losses and paid to reported claim counts  are typically prepared as a means of determining the stability of various determinants of loss development  such as consistency in claims settlement and case reserving 
with respect to upcic s primary exposure  florida personal property coverage  the hurricanes in and required upcic to place more focus on adjusting hurricane claims during  and into upcic then experienced a surge in non hurricane claims which led the loss development patterns for non catastrophe losses to increase substantially in the years during and following the active hurricane seasons of and potential reserve estimate variability 
given the nature of our business catastrophe exposed personal property coverage  the methods employed by actuaries include a range of estimated unpaid losses reflecting a level of uncertainty 
the range of estimated ultimate losses is typically smaller for older  more mature accident periods and greater for more recent  less mature accident periods 
the greatest level of uncertainty is associated with accident years during which catastrophe events occurred 
for example  the increased uncertainty associated with accident years and increases the bounds of the range 
in selecting the range of reasonable estimates  the assumptions used to select development factors and initial expected loss ratios are not changed 
rather  the range of indications produced by the various methods is inspected  the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method are considered  and from those inputs a range of estimates can be selected 
projections of loss and lae liabilities are subject to potentially large errors of estimation since the ultimate disposition of claims incurred prior to the financial statement date  whether reported or not  is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred 
examples of these events include jury decisions  court interpretations  legislative changes  public attitudes  and social economic conditions such as inflation 
any estimate of future costs is subject to the inherent limitation on one s ability to predict the aggregate course of future events 
it should therefore be expected that the actual emergence of losses and lae will vary  perhaps materially  from any estimate 
the inherent uncertainty associated with the insurance entities loss and lae liability is magnified due to their concentration of property business in catastrophe exposed coastal states  primarily florida 
the and hurricanes created great uncertainty in determining ultimate losses for these natural catastrophes 
issues related to applicability of deductibles  availability and cost of repair services and materials  and other factors have increased the variability in estimates of the related loss reserves 
upcic experienced unanticipated unfavorable loss development on catastrophe losses from claims related to and being reopened and new claims being opened due to public adjusters encouraging policyholders to file new claims  and from assessments related to condominium policies 
due to the inherent uncertainty  the parameters of the loss estimation methodologies are updated on an annual basis as new information emerges 
adequacy of reserve estimates 
we believe our net loss and lae reserves are appropriately established based on available methodology  facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for reported losses and ibnr losses and as a result we believe no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
we have created a proprietary claims analysis tool pp to analyze and calculate reserves 
pp is a custom built application that aggregates  analyzes and forecasts reserves based on historical data that spans more than a decade 
it identifies historical claims data using same like kind and quality variables that exist in present claims and sets forth appropriate  more accurate reserves on current claims 
pp is reviewed by management on a weekly basis in reviewing the topography of existing and incoming claims 
pp will be analyzed at each quarters end and adjustments to reserves are made at an aggregate level when appropriate 

table of contents pp was initially used for third quarter reserve analysis resulting in an increase in and loss year reserves 
further refinements were put into place in fourth quarter which included inflation adjustments for past claims into dollars inflation guard 
pp was reviewed by an independent third party for data integrity and system reliability 
this program is used for quarterly reviews on an ongoing basis 
due to the uncertainties involved  the scenarios described and quantified above are reasonably likely  but the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
the liability for unpaid losses and lae at december  is million 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred ceding commissions 
we incur costs in connection with the production of new and renewal insurance policies that are referred to as policy acquisition costs 
commissions and state premium taxes are costs of acquiring insurance policies that vary with  and are directly related to  the successful production of new and renewal business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period during which the premiums are earned on the underlying policies 
we record income in the form of ceding commissions from certain reinsurers in connection with our quota share reinsurance contracts 
we estimate the amount of ceding commissions to be deferred on a basis consistent with the deferral of acquisition costs incurred with the production of the original policies issued and the terms of the applicable reinsurance contracts 
the deferred ceding commissions are offset against the deferred policy acquisition costs with the net result presented as deferred policy acquisition costs  net on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   deferred policy acquisition costs were million and deferred ceding commissions were million 
deferred policy acquisition costs were reduced by deferred ceding commissions and shown net on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of million 
provision for premium deficiency 
our policy is to evaluate and recognize losses on insurance contracts when estimated future claims and maintenance costs under a group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and investment income 
the determination of the provision for premium deficiency requires estimation of the costs of losses  catastrophic reinsurance and policy maintenance to be incurred and investment income to be earned over the remaining policy period 
management has determined that a provision for premium deficiency was not warranted as of december  reinsurance 
in the normal course of business  we seek to reduce the risk of loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
while ceding premiums to reinsurers reduces our risk of exposure in the event of catastrophic losses  it also reduces our potential for greater profits in the event that such catastrophic events do not occur 
we believe that the extent of our reinsurance is typical of a company of our size in the homeowners insurance industry 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the reinsurance agreement and consistent with the establishment of our liability 
the insurance entities reinsurance policies do not relieve them from their obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses  consequently  allowances are established for amounts deemed uncollectible 
no such allowance was deemed necessary as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements during related parties downes and associates  a multi line insurance adjustment corporation based in deerfield beach  florida performs certain claims adjusting work for the insurance entities

the following discussion provides comparative information for significant changes to the components of net income and comprehensive income for compared to the increase in net earned premiums of million  or compared to the prior year  reflects an increase in direct earned premiums of million partially offset by an increase in ceded earned premiums of million 
the increase in direct earned premiums is due primarily to rate increases over the past months 
these rate increases  along with strategic initiatives we have undertaken to manage our exposure such as the decision not to renew certain policies we believe have inadequate premiums relative to projected risks and expenses  have resulted in a moderate reduction in the number of policies in force even as the amount of direct written premiums have increased 
the benefit from the rate increases continued to be partially offset by wind mitigation credits within the state of florida 
the increase in ceded earned premiums of million is attributable to an increase in quota share ceded premiums in proportion to the growth in direct written premiums  a million increase related to the settlement of a dispute with our predecessor quota share reinsurer and million in relating to an underlying property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contract with an unaffiliated third party reinsurer that did not exist during the after tax effect of the settlement with our predecessor quota share reinsurer was per diluted share 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the quota share cession rate from for the reinsurance program to for the reinsurance program 
the reduction in net investment income reflects a reduction in the amount of interest earning securities held in the investment portfolio and non recurring charges for investment accounting services as we converted to a new investment accounting service provider 
net realized losses on investments of million recorded during the year ended december  reflect loss in value of investments sold during the period 
the majority of realized losses recorded during the year ended december  were in the metals and mining sector 
we hold debt and equity securities  derivatives and other investments in our trading portfolio 
all unrealized gains and losses on investments in our trading portfolio are reflected in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses reflect the change in value during the period 
table of contents for investments held in our trading portfolio  including the reversal of unrealized gains and losses recorded when investments are sold 
we recorded net unrealized gains of million during the year ended december   the majority of which represent the reversal of unrealized losses for investments sold during commission revenue is comprised principally of brokerage commission we earn from reinsurers 
the increase in commission revenue of thousand is due to an increase in ceded earned premium for the reinsurance contract periods that were in effect during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in policy fees are comprised primarily of the managing general agent s policy fee income from insurance policies 
the decrease of thousand reflects a reduction in the number of policies written and renewed primarily due to the rate increases that have taken effect  which has caused some attrition 
the increase in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of million reflects an increase in the amount of charges incurred for the current accident year of million  offset by a reduction in the amount of prior year development also known as reserve re estimates recorded in the current year of million 
the increase in current year charges was heavily influenced by losses and loss adjustment expenses related to tropical storm hurricane isaac and tropical storm debby 
the net loss and lae ratios  or net losses and lae as a percentage of net earned premiums  were and during years ended december   and  respectively  and were comprised of the following components in thousands year ended december  direct ceded net loss and loss adjustment expenses premiums earned loss lae ratios year ended december  direct ceded net loss and loss adjustment expenses premiums earned loss lae ratios the reduction in the net loss and lae ratio is mostly the result of a decrease in the relative and absolute amounts of prior years development recorded in the current year 
the ratio also decreased as a result of an increase in net premiums earned relating to an increase in direct premiums earned as well as proportionately less ceded premiums earned due to the lower cession rate under the quota share reinsurance contract compared to the cession rate under the quota share contract 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million was due to several factors including million of charges related to net deferred policy acquisition costs 
the reduction in the amount of ceding commissions received from the quota share reinsurer under the reinsurance program  effectively increased the amount of net deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization 
in addition  we are charging certain costs directly to earnings that were previously capitalized under the superseded fasb guidance which governed how we accounted for deferred policy acquisition costs until january  charges of million were recorded in the latter part of as a result of a mandatory assessment by the florida insurance guaranty association figa 
figa assessments are ultimately passed down to policyholders 
we will recover these charges over a twelve month period beginning february  there were also increases in salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation and insurance  of million  million  million and million  respectively offset partially by a decrease in insurance department fees of million 
income tax expense increased in tandem with the increase in taxable income 
our effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period during primarily as a result of a change in the mix of true ups recorded upon the completion of prior years tax returns and estimated penalties and interest for current year underpayment of estimated taxes 
there was also an increase in the amount of non deductible compensation which increased the effective tax rate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income decreased by million  or  primarily attributable to net losses in our investment portfolio recorded during compared to net gains recorded in reflecting a particularly steep decline in the value of our equity securities holdings in our investment portfolio 
the increase in net premiums earned in outpaced the increase in operating costs and expenses 
the rate increases which have taken affect in late and early are providing positive results that somewhat mitigate the negative effect of wind mitigation credits

the following discussion provides comparative information for significant changes to the components of net income and comprehensive income for compared to the increase in net earned premiums of million  or  was due to an increase in the average number of policies written generated by our agent network and the rate increases which became effective in  as well as those that became effective in the latter part of these rate increases have had a positive effect on premium generated by renewal policies 
the benefit from these factors was partially offset by an increase in the number of policies in force eligible for wind mitigation credits 
net unrealized losses on investments of million  recorded during year ended december   reflect the net decrease in value of investments held in our trading portfolio as of december  as well as the reversal of unrealized gains or losses for securities held at december  and subsequently sold 
these unrealized losses in the trading portfolio for the year ended december   were partially offset by realized gains of million and foreign currency gains on investments of million recorded during the same period 
the unrealized losses reflect a decline in the value of our equity securities holdings during the second half of the year ended december  we will continue to record future changes in the market value of our trading portfolio directly to earnings as unrealized gains and losses on investments 
all investment securities held at june   were classified as available for sale with net unrealized losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition 
during  management evaluated the trading activity of our investment portfolio  investing strategy and overall investment program 
as a result of this evaluation  we reclassified the available for sale portfolio as a trading portfolio effective july  since july   changes in the market value of our trading portfolio are recorded directly to revenues as unrealized gains or losses on investments 
in previous periods  the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio were appropriately included in other comprehensive income rather than current period income 
commission revenue is comprised principally of reinsurance commission sharing agreements 
the increase in commission revenue of million is due to an increase in the amount of ceded premiums 

table of contents the increase in other revenues of thousand is primarily due to a higher volume of referrals made to other insurance companies for coverage that we do not offer 
the increase in losses and lae expenses is due to the servicing of additional policies from the growth in the average number of policies in force and the associated increase in the aggregate total insured value of those policies on a year over year basis 
the net loss and lae ratios  or net losses and lae as a percentage of net earned premiums  were and during years ended december   and  respectively  and were comprised of the following components in thousands year ended december  direct ceded net loss and loss adjustment expenses premiums earned loss lae ratios year ended december  direct ceded net loss and loss adjustment expenses premiums earned loss lae ratios the reduction in the net loss and lae ratio is the result of a proportionately greater increase in premiums earned than the increase in losses and lae  driven primarily by the premium rate increases effective during the first quarter of and the latter part of general and administrative expenses increased by million due primarily to an increase in the amount of expenses related to deferred acquisition costs  net of ceded commissions  and the absence  during  of credits from the recovery of florida insurance guaranty association figa assessments recorded during year ended december  figa assessments are ultimately passed down to policyholders 
amounts charged or credited to our earnings represent timing differences between the time assessments are made by figa to us  and the collection of those assessments from policyholders 
there were also increases in insurance department fees and legal fees related to corporate matters 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in performance based incentive bonus accruals which are based on measures of income before income taxes 
there were also decreases in share based compensation  bad debt expense and equipment expense 
the decrease in income tax expense was the result of a significant reduction in taxable income due to losses in the trading portfolio and additional reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our effective tax rate remained relatively the same at for the year ended december  compared to for the same period during we have not recorded other comprehensive income since we transferred the available for sale portfolio to trading 
the other comprehensive income recorded during the year ended december  represents the reversal of all accumulated other comprehensive income at december   which was all related to investments available for sale 
analysis of financial condition changes we believe that premiums will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our policy is to invest amounts considered to be in excess of current working capital requirements 
we reduced our aggregate investment securities to million as of december   from million as of december   in response to market conditions 
we have a receivable of million at december   for securities sold that had not yet settled compared to million at december   and a payable for securities purchased that had not yet settled of million as of december   compared to million at december

amounts held on deposit by upcic with the state of florida decreased by million as upcic paid premium installments in connection with the t arrangement through december  reinsurance receivable  net  represents inuring premiums receivable  net of ceded premiums payable with our quota share reinsurer 
the decrease of million during  to million  was due to the timing of settlements with our quota share reinsurers  and a change in the structure of the contractual arrangements eliminating layers of coverage held in the reinsurance program 
this was slightly offset by a net decrease in premiums payable due to a reduction in the quota share premium cession rate from for the reinsurance program to for the program 
premiums receivable represent amounts due from policyholders 
the increase of million during  to million  was due to growth in  and timing of  direct written premiums 
the increase in property and equipment of million to million reflects the cost of constructing a new office building which was placed into service at the end of march see note  insurance operations  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for a roll forward in the balance of our deferred policy acquisition costs 
we had income taxes recoverable of million as of december  for federal taxes resulting from overpayments related to the taxable year 
there were no amounts recoverable as of december  see note  income taxes  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of deferred income taxes as of december  and  which shows the components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of both balance sheet dates 
see below for a discussion of the changes in the balance of our unpaid losses and lae 
unearned premiums represent the portion of written premiums that will be earned pro rata in the future 
the increase of million during  to million  was due to growth in  and timing of  direct written premiums 
advance premium represents premium payments made by policyholders ahead of the effective date of the policies 
the decrease of million represents a shift in the timing of those payments from december to january 
reinsurance payable  net  represents our liability to reinsurers for ceded written premiums  net of ceding commissions receivable 
the decrease of million to million during was primarily due to the timing of settlement with our reinsurers 
income taxes payable decreased by million to thousand due to timing of tax remittances 
the decrease in long term debt of million was due to principal payments made during liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its short and long term obligations 
funds generated from operations have generally been sufficient to meet liquidity requirements and we expect that in the future funds from operations will continue to meet such requirements 

table of contents the balance of cash and cash equivalents as of december  was million 
most of this amount is available to pay claims in the event of a catastrophic event pending reimbursement amounts recoverable under reinsurance agreements 
the balance of restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december  was million 
restricted cash as of december  represents cash equivalents on deposit with regulatory agencies in the various states in which our insurance entities do business including million held by florida for the benefit of upcic in connection with the t arrangement as described under the caption reinsurance program above 
see note  significant accounting policies  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for information as to the nature of restrictions 
uih s liquidity requirements primarily include the payment of dividends to shareholders and interest and principal on debt obligations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to shareholders will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
the maximum amount of dividends  which can be paid by florida insurance companies without prior approval of the commissioner of the oir  is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus 
the maximum dividend that may be paid by the insurance entities to uih without prior approval is limited to the lesser of statutory net income from operations of the preceding calendar year or statutory unassigned surplus as of the preceding year end 
during the years ended december  and  the insurance entities did not pay dividends to uih 
our insurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies sold by the insurance entities 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums  commissions  policy fees and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay loss claims and operating expenses 
we maintain substantial investments in highly liquid  marketable securities 
liquidity can also be generated by funds received upon the sale of marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
effective july   we elected to classify our securities investment portfolio as trading 
accordingly  purchases and sales of investment securities are included in cash flows from operations beginning july  we generated million from operating activities for the year ended december  compared to million generated and million used for the years ended december  and cash flows generated from operating activities during the year ended december   includes proceeds from sales of investment securities  net of purchases of million 
the use of cash in operating activities during the year ended december reflects purchases of investment securities  net of proceeds from sales  of million since july  when we transferred our securities from the available for sale classification to trading 
prior to july   proceeds from the sale  and purchases of securities were reflected in investing activities 
the insurance entities are responsible for losses related to catastrophic events with incurred losses in excess of coverage provided by our reinsurance programs and for losses that otherwise are not covered by the reinsurance programs  which could have a material adverse effect on the insurance entities and the our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

as of december   based on calculations using the appropriate naic rbc formula  the insurance entities reported total adjusted capital was in excess of the requirements 
failure by the insurance entities to maintain the required level of statutory capital and surplus could result in the suspension of their authority to write new or renewal business  other regulatory actions  or ultimately  in the revocation of their certificate of authority by the oir 
on november   upcic entered into a million surplus note with the florida state board of administration sba under florida s insurance capital build up incentive program icbui 
the surplus note has a twenty year term and accrues interest  adjusted quarterly based on the year constant maturity treasury index 
for the first three years of the term of the surplus note  upcic was required to pay interest only 

table of contents in may  the florida legislature passed a law providing participants in the icbui an opportunity to amend the terms of their surplus notes based on law changes 
the new law contains methods for calculating compliance with the writing ratio requirements that are more favorable to upcic than prior law and the prior terms of the surplus note 
on november   upcic and the sba executed an addendum to the surplus note addendum that reflects these law changes 
the terms of the addendum were effective july  in addition to other less significant changes  the addendum modifies the definitions of minimum required surplus  minimum writing ratio  surplus  and gross written premium  as defined in the original surplus note 
prior to the execution of the addendum  upcic was in compliance with each of the loan s covenants as implemented by rules promulgated by the sba 
upcic currently remains in compliance with each of the loan s covenants as implemented by rules promulgated by the sba 
an event of default will occur under the surplus note  as amended  if upcic i defaults in the payment of the surplus note  ii drops below a net written premium to surplus of for three consecutive quarters beginning january  and drops below a gross written premium to surplus ratio of for three consecutive quarters beginning january   iii fails to submit quarterly filings to the oir  iv fails to maintain at least million of surplus during the term of the surplus note  except for certain situations  v misuses proceeds of the surplus note  vi makes any misrepresentations in the application for the program  vii pays any dividend when principal or interest payments are past due under the surplus note  or viii fails to maintain a level of surplus sufficient to cover in excess of upcic s in year probable maximum loss as determined by a hurricane loss model accepted by the florida commission on hurricane loss projection methodology as certified by the oir annually 
as of december   upcic s net written premium to surplus ratio and gross written premium to surplus ratio were in excess of the required minimums and  therefore  upcic is not subject to increases in interest rates 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec  registering i for issuance up to million of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  rights or depositary shares  or units consisting of any combination thereof and ii for resale up to million shares of common stock owned by our former chairman  president and chief executive officer  bradley i 
meier 
the shelf registration statement is intended to give uih additional flexibility to finance future business opportunities and support our insurance subsidiaries by accessing the capital markets in an efficient and cost effective manner 
however  we have no present intention of offering any securities pursuant to this registration statement 
we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by mr 
meier 
nevertheless  any such sales will increase our public float and  therefore  may increase our cost of capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 
liability for unpaid losses and lae we are required to periodically estimate and reflect on our balance sheet the amount needed to pay losses and related loss adjustment expenses on reported and unreported claims 
see item liability for unpaid losses and lae for a description of this process 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending liability for unpaid losses and lae as shown in our consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated in thousands 
table of contents year ended december  balance at beginning of year less reinsurance recoverable net balance at beginning of year incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance at end of year plus reinsurance recoverable balance at end of year based upon consultations with our independent actuarial consultants and their statement of opinion on losses and lae  we believe that the liability for unpaid losses and lae is currently adequate to cover all claims and related expenses which may arise from incidents reported and ibnr 
see our discussion in critical accounting policies and estimates adequacy of reserve estimates for information about a tool used by management to analyze and calculate reserves 
the following table provides total unpaid loss and lae  net of related reinsurance recoverables in thousands years ended december  unpaid loss and lae  net ibnr loss and lae  net total unpaid loss and lae  net reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss and lae reinsurance recoverable on ibnr loss and lae total reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss and lae the table below illustrates the change over time of the direct reserves established for unpaid losses and lae for the insurance entities liability for unpaid losses and lae re estimates at the end of the last eleven calendar years through december  in thousands the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive re estimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of our expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest re estimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 

table of contents the table also presents the gross re estimated liability as of the end of the latest re estimation period  with separate disclosure of the related re estimated reinsurance recoverable 
the liability for unpaid losses and lae re estimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years 
unfavorable reserve re estimates are shown in this table in parentheses

table of contents the following liability for unpaid losses and lae re estimates table illustrates the change over time of the reserves  net of reinsurance  established for unpaid losses and lae for the insurance entities at the end of the last eleven calendar years through december  in thousands years ended december  gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expense reinsurance recoverable balance sheet liability cumulative paid as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later balance sheet liability one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative redundancy deficiency percent gross re estimated liability latest re estimated recovery latest net re estimated liability latest gross cumulative redundancy deficiency the cumulative redundancy or deficiency represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
a deficiency indicates that the latest estimate of the liability for losses and lae is higher than the liability that was originally estimated and a redundancy indicates that such estimate is lower 
it should be emphasized that the table presents a run off of balance sheet liability for the periods indicated rather than accident or policy loss development for those periods 
therefore  each amount in the table includes the cumulative effects of changes in liability for all prior periods 
conditions and trends that have affected liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
underwriting results of insurance companies are frequently measured by their combined ratios  which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios described in the following paragraph 
however  investment income  federal income taxes and other non underwriting income or expense are not reflected in the combined ratio 
the profitability of property and casualty insurance companies depends on income from underwriting  investment and service operations 
underwriting results are considered profitable when the combined ratio is under and unprofitable when the combined ratio is over 

table of contents the following table provides the statutory loss ratios  expense ratios and combined ratios for the periods indicated for the insurance entities years ended december  loss ratio upcic appcic expense ratio upcic appcic combined ratio upcic appcic the ratios are net of reinsurance  including catastrophe reinsurance premiums which comprise a significant cost  and inclusive of lae 
the expense ratios include management fees and commission paid to an affiliate of the insurance entities in the amount of million and million for upcic for the years ended december  and  respectively and thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively for appcic 
the fees and commission paid to the affiliate are eliminated in consolidation 
in order to reduce losses and thereby reduce the loss ratio and the combined ratio  we have taken several steps 
these steps include closely monitoring rate levels for new and renewal business  restructuring the homeowners insurance coverage offered  reducing the cost of catastrophic reinsurance coverage  and working to reduce general and administrative expenses 
ratings upcic s financial strength is rated by a rating agency to measure upcic s ability to meet its financial obligations to its policyholders 
the agency maintains a letter scale financial stability rating system ranging from a a double prime to l licensed by state regulatory authorities 
in march  to help address questions and concerns regarding the agency s rating and review process  the agency published guidance on financial stability ratings and catastrophe reinsurance program reporting for florida property insurers 
the document contains the criteria the agency considers when reviewing a company 
on march   upcic received notice from the agency that it would require a capital infusion of million by april  in order for it to maintain its a rating 
to comply with this requirement uih contributed an aggregate amount of million to upcic in march on december   the agency affirmed upcic s financial stability rating of a 
a financial stability rating of a is the third highest of six possible rating levels 
according to the agency  a ratings are assigned to insurers that have exceptional ability to maintain liquidity of invested assets  quality reinsurance  acceptable financial leverage and realistic pricing while simultaneously establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at reasonable levels 
the rating of upcic is subject to at least annual review by  and may be revised upward or downward or revoked at the sole discretion of the agency 
ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
in addition  the rating agency may at any time require a capital infusion into upcic by its parent company in order to maintain its rating  which may adversely affect our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
see item a a downgrade in our financial stability rating may have an adverse effect on our competitive position  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the cost of paying losses and lae 
insurance premiums are established before we know the amount of loss and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses 
consequently  we attempt to anticipate the future impact of inflation when establishing rate levels 
while we attempt to charge adequate rates  we may be limited in raising its premium levels for competitive and regulatory reasons 
inflation also affects the market value of our investment portfolio and the investment rate of return 
any future economic changes which result in prolonged and increasing levels of inflation could cause increases in the dollar amount of incurred loss and lae and thereby materially adversely affect future liability requirements
