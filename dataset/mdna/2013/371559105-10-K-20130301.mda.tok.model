part i item business 
overview we own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching and other rail related services in the united states  australia  canada  the netherlands and belgium 
in addition  we operate a longer haul railroad that runs approximately  miles between tarcoola in south australia and darwin in the northern territory of australia 
as of december   we operated in states in the united states  four australian states  one australian territory and four canadian provinces and provide rail service at ports in north america  australia and europe 
as of december   we operated over approximately  miles of owned  jointly owned or leased track inclusive of the tarcoola to darwin rail line operated under a concession agreement and  additional miles under other contractual track access arrangements 
on october   we acquired railamerica  inc railamerica for approximately billion equity purchase price of approximately billion plus net debt of million  which is our largest acquisition to date 
railamerica owned and operated short line freight railroads in north america  with approximately  miles of track in us states and three canadian provinces as of the acquisition date 
our acquisition of railamerica combined the two largest short line railroad operators in north america 
the acquisition is expected to provide a wide national footprint for future industrial and commercial development along our railroads in north america  and to allow us to realize significant cost savings 
following our acquisition of railamerica  we believe we are the largest operator of short line and regional freight railroads in north america 
growth strategy since our initial public offering in through december   our revenues increased at a compound annual growth rate of  from million in to million in we have achieved these results primarily through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy 
the two main drivers of our growth strategy are the execution of our operating strategy and our acquisition and investment strategy 
operating strategy our railroads operate under strong local management teams  with centralized administrative  commercial and operational support and oversight 
as of january   our continuing operations were organized as regions  which include one new region that we created following the acquisition of railamerica 
in the united states  we have eight regions rail link which includes industrial switching and port operations  pacific  mountain west  central  southern  midwest  ohio valley and northeast 
outside the united states  we have three regions australia  canada which includes a contiguous railroad located in the united states and europe which consists of operations in the netherlands and belgium 
in each of our regions  we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive  local knowledge and customer service that we view as necessary to achieve our financial goals 
our regional managers continually focus on increasing our return on invested capital  earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy 
at the regional level  our operating strategy consists of the following four principal elements continuous safety improvement 
we believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees  our customers and the communities in which we conduct business 
each year  we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program 
in  g w achieved a consolidated federal railroad association fra reportable injury frequency rate of per  man hours worked  which does not include railamerica safety results 
through the implementation of our safety program  we have reduced our injury frequency rate by since  when it was injuries per  man hours worked 
in  railamerica achieved a consolidated fra reportable injury frequency rate of per  man hours worked 
on a pro forma basis  g w reportable injury frequency rate combined with railamerica was for the year ended december  for comparative purposes  in january through november  the most recent month for which fra data is publicly available  the united states short line average was injuries per  man hours worked  and the united states regional railroad average was injuries per  man hours worked 
based on these results  in  g w was more than six times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages  and also safer than any us class i railroad 
focused regional marketing 
we generally build and operate each of our regions on a base of large industrial customers and seek to grow rail traffic through marketing efforts 
as a result of the acquisition of railamerica  we expect our expanded north american footprint will provide us with greater visibility to new commercial and industrial development opportunities in north america and increase the success of our marketing efforts 
we also pursue additional sources of revenue by marketing to new industrial customers and providing ancillary rail services 
these ancillary rail services include railcar switching  repair  storage  cleaning  weighing and blocking and bulk transfer  which enable shippers and class i carriers to move freight more easily and cost effectively 
separately  in australia and europe  where there are open access regimes  we are able to compete for new business opportunities with customers anywhere on the open access rail network 
lower operating costs 
we focus on lowering operating costs and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than they were operated before our acquisition 
we typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead  consolidating equipment and track maintenance contracts  reducing transportation costs and selling surplus assets 
efficient use of capital 
we invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers 
at the same time  we seek to maximize our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs 
for example  in our short haul and regional operations in north america  we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for traffic type and density 
in addition  because of the importance of certain customers and railroads to the regional economies  we are able  in some instances  to obtain state  provincial and or federal grants to upgrade track 
typically  we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand alone basis 
to assist our local management teams  we provide commercial and operational support from corporate staff groups where there are benefits to be gained from centralized expertise 
our commercial group assists local management by providing assistance with regional pricing  origin and destination offerings across the company  managing real estate revenue including from land leases and crossing and access rights  industrial development project expertise  customer service and class i relationship management 
our operations department assists with the implementation of our safety culture and training programs  manages a centralized purchasing staff to leverage our scale in purchasing rail and rail related equipment  assists with efficient equipment utilization and service design  and provides mechanical  locomotive and bridge engineering expertise 
in addition  we maintain other traditional  centralized functions  such as accounting  finance  legal  corporate development  government and industry affairs  human resources and information technology 
acquisition and investment strategy our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long term lease of existing railroads  as well as investment in rail equipment and or track infrastructure to serve new and existing customers 
since  we have completed acquisitions and made several significant rail equipment investments to serve customers that are developing natural resource projects  such as iron ore mines 
historically  our acquisition  investment and long term lease opportunities have been from the following five sources acquisitions of other regional railroads or short line railroads in the united states and canada  such as our acquisitions of railamerica in  arizona eastern railway company azer in  cagy industries  inc in  the ohio central railroad system in and rail management corporation in based on association of american railroads aar data  as of december   there were approximately short line and regional railroads in the united states not owned by us  investments in track and or rolling stock to support new industrial or mineral development in new or existing areas of operations  such as our long term rail services agreement with labrador iron mines limited lim to haul unit trains of iron ore over lim six kilometer railway  and our recently announced expansion of two existing rail haulage contracts to transport export iron ore in south australia  acquisitions of international railroads  such as our acquisitions of freightlink pty ltd freightlink in australia and rotterdam rail feeding rrf in the netherlands 
we believe that there are additional acquisition and investment opportunities in australia  europe and other international markets  acquisitions or long term leases of branch lines of class i railroads  such as our recent lease from norfolk southern railway company ns of the columbus chattahoochee railroad  inc  a mile segment of ns track that runs from girard  alabama to mahrt  alabama  and acquisitions of rail lines of industrial companies  such as our acquisition of railroads owned by georgia pacific corporation 
when we make acquisitions  we seek to derive revenues and cost synergies wherever possible and to implement best practices to increase the value of our investment  which is frequently accomplished through the elimination of duplicative overhead functions  implementation of our safety culture  improvements to operating plans and equipment utilization and enhanced customer service 
for instance  with the acquisition of railamerica we have identified duplicative corporate overhead costs and general administrative expenses  which we believe are not necessary for the combined operations  and that we anticipate will result in ongoing annual cost savings of approximately million  excluding implementation costs we expect to incur to realize these savings 
in addition  we intend to leverage railamerica real estate department and plan to implement best practices that are identified as part of the integration across all our railroads 
following the railamerica acquisition  we are continuing to target these five sources of acquisition and investment opportunities 
we also believe that our larger footprint of railroads in north america will increase the number of future opportunities to make contiguous short line acquisitions due to a higher number of touch points with other railroads 
on a global basis  we believe that our increased scale and greater financial resources will improve our ability to invest in rail opportunities worldwide 
we have played a significant role in the consolidation of the short line industry in north america and have made a number of important railroad investments in international markets  and we expect to continue to pursue our acquisition and investment strategy while adhering to our disciplined valuation approach 
industry north america united states according to the aar  there are railroads in the united states operating over  miles of track 
the stb classifies railroads operating in the united states into one of three categories based on the amount of an individual railroad operating revenues adjusted for inflation 
under current classification levels  class i railroads are individual railroads not including holding companies with over million in revenues 
regional and local railroads operate approximately  miles of track in the united states 
the primary function of these smaller railroads is to provide local service to rail customers and communities not located on the class i networks 
the following table shows the breakdown of railroads in the united states by classification classification of railroads number aggregate miles operated revenues and miles operated class i million or more regional at least million and or more miles operated or million to million local less than million and less than miles operated total csx corp  bnsf railway co  norfolk southern corp  kansas city southern railway company  union pacific railroad co  canadian national railway and canadian pacific railway 
source aar railroad facts book class i railroads operate across many different states and concentrate largely  though not exclusively  on long haul  high density intercity traffic lanes 
regional railroads typically operate to miles of track and provide service to selected areas of the country  mainly connecting neighboring states and or economic centers 
typically  short line or local railroads serve as branch lines connecting customers with class i railroads 
short line railroads have more predictable and straightforward operations as they generally perform point to point service over shorter distances  versus the complex networks associated with the large class i railroads 
regional and short line railroad traffic is largely driven by carloads that are interchanged with other carriers 
for example  a class i railroad may transport freight hundreds or thousands of miles from its origination point  and then pass the railcar to a short line railroad  which provides the final step of service directly to the terminating customer 
the railroad industry in the united states has undergone significant change since the passage of the staggers rail act of staggers act  which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads 
following the passage of the staggers act  class i railroads in the united states took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation  primarily trucks 
in furtherance of that goal  class i railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long haul systems  and some of them sold branch lines to short line railroads  whose smaller scale and more cost efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on those lines 
divestiture of branch lines enabled class i carriers to minimize incremental capital expenditures  concentrate traffic density  improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment  and spurred the growth in the short line railroad industry 
we operate one regional and local short line railroads in the united states over approximately  miles of track 
canada according to rail trends  published by the railway association of canada rac  there are  miles of track operated by railroads in canada 
we operate seven local short line railroads in canada over approximately  miles of track 
australia australia has over  miles approximately  kilometers of both publicly and privately owned track that link major capital cities and key regional centers together  as well as key mining regions to ports 
the australian rail network comprises three track gauges broad  standard and narrow gauge 
there are three major interstate rail segments in australia the east west corridor sydney  new south wales to perth  western australia  the east coast corridor brisbane  queensland to melbourne  victoria  and the north south corridor adelaide  south australia to darwin  northern territory 
in addition  there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks servicing major agricultural and mining regions in queensland  new south wales  western australia and south australia 
through our australian subsidiaries  we manage approximately  miles approximately  kilometers of track in south australia and the northern territory  which includes approximately  miles approximately  kilometers of track between darwin and tarcoola that we manage pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in the australian rail freight industry is largely open access  which means that network owners and managers must provide access to the rail network to all accredited rail service providers subject to the rules and negotiation framework of each applicable access regime 
we are an accredited rail service provider in all mainland australian states and in the northern territory 
the rules generally include pricing principles and standards of use  and are established by the applicable state or commonwealth government 
the rail industry is structured around two components train operations for freight haulage services above rail and rail track access operation and management below rail 
this contrasts with the north american freight rail industry where railroad operators almost always have exclusive use of the track they own or lease 
through our concession agreements  we have long term economic ownership of the primary tracks that we manage in south australia and the northern territory  and we receive below rail access fees when other rail operators use the track we manage 
our economic ownership of the tracks we manage  combined with our above rail operations  makes our australian operations more similar to a typical north american railroad 
because australian rail customers have access to multiple rail carriers under open access regimes  all rail carriers face possible competition from other rail carriers  as well as competition from competing modes of transportation  such as trucks for above rail business 
the open access nature of the australian rail freight industry enables rail operators to develop new business and customer relationships in areas outside of their current operations  and there are limited barriers to entry that preclude any rail operator from approaching a customer to seek new business 
however  shipments of bulk commodities in australia are generally handled under long term agreements with dedicated equipment that may include take or pay provisions and or exclusivity arrangements  which make capturing new business from an existing rail operator more difficult 
netherlands according to prorail  the entity responsible for a substantial majority of the dutch rail infrastructure  there are approximately  miles of track under its control on the dutch rail network 
as a result of the country open access regime  this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator 
according to the trade association  rail cargo information netherlands  there are currently rail operators that provide freight rail services in the netherlands 
in the netherlands  we operate primarily in the port of rotterdam pursuant to the open access regime 
belgium according to infrabel  the belgian railways infrastructure manager  there are approximately  miles of track under its control on the belgian rail network and rail operators certified for freight transport in belgium 
as a result of the country open access regime  this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator 
in belgium  we operate primarily in the port of antwerp pursuant to the open access regime 
operations as of december   through our subsidiaries  we owned or leased freight railroads 
of these  are short line railroads and one is a regional freight railroad with a total of approximately  miles of track in the united states  australia  canada  the netherlands and belgium 
we also operated one longer haul  mile railroad  which links the port of darwin to the australian interstate rail network in south australia  pursuant to a concession agreement 
also  through various track access arrangements  we operate over  additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others 
freight revenues we generate freight revenues primarily from the haulage of freight by rail 
freight revenues represented  and of our total revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
non freight revenues we generate non freight revenues primarily from the following activities rail car switching revenues generated from industrial switching the movement of rail cars within industrial plants and their related facilities  port terminal switching the movement of customer rail cars from one track to another track on the same railroad  primarily at united states ports and contract coal loading  car hire and rental services charges paid by other railroads for the use of our rail cars  demurrage and storage charges to customers for holding or storing their rail cars  car repair services charges for repairing rail cars owned by others  either under contract or in accordance with aar rules  other operating income includes  among others  revenues from providing crewing services and track access and management fees  real estate holdings  and from providing access to passenger operations  such as from amtrak use of the new england central railroad  fuel sales to third parties revenues earned by genesee wyoming australia pty ltd gwa in south australia from the sale of diesel fuel to other rail operators  gwa sold its third party fuel operation in cook  south australia in the third quarter of  and railroad construction revenues earned by atlas railroad construction atlas for railroad engineering  construction  maintenance and repair  primarily in the midwestern  northeastern and southeastern united states  for short line and regional railroads  public transit agencies and industrial customers 
non freight revenues represented  and of our total operating revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
railcar switching represented  and of our total non freight revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
customers as of december   our operations served over  freight customers 
freight revenues from our largest freight customers not including railamerica customers accounted for approximately  and of our operating revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
six of our largest freight customers not including railamerica customers in were located in australia 
freight revenues from railamerica largest freight customers accounted for approximately of their operating revenues in and their largest freight customer was a company in the steel and metals industry and represented approximately of their total revenues 
in north america  we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us  our connecting carriers and the customer 
these contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration  with terms ranging from less than one year to years 
these contracts establish a price or  in the case of longer term contracts  a methodology for determining a price  but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume 
freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped 
in australia  we generally handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts directly with our customers 
these contracts generally contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing  with the fixed portion linked to our invested capital and the variable portion based on the volumes shipped 
commodities our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities 
for a comparison of freight revenues  carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended december   and  see the discussion under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
commodity group descriptions the intermodal commodity group consists of various commodities shipped in trailers or containers on flat cars 
the coal and coke commodity group consists primarily of shipments of coal to power plants and industrial customers 
the farm and food products commodity group consists primarily of wheat  barley  corn and other grains 
the pulp and paper commodity group consists primarily of outbound shipments of container board and finished papers and inbound shipments of wood pulp 
the metallic ores commodity group consists primarily of manganese ore  iron ore  copper concentrate and ore  alumina and nickel ore 
the metals commodity group consists primarily of finished steel products such as coils  pipe  slabs and ingots as well as scrap metal 
the minerals and stone commodity group consists primarily of gypsum  salt used in highway ice control  cement  marble  sand used in fracking oil and gas wells  clay and limestone 
the chemicals and plastics commodity group consists primarily of denatured alcohol  sulfuric acid and other chemicals used in manufacturing  particularly in the paper industry 
the lumber and forest products commodity group consists primarily of export logs  finished lumber  wood pellets and wood chips used in paper manufacturing 
the petroleum products commodity group consists primarily of liquefied petroleum gas  crude oil  asphalt and diesel fuel 
the autos and auto parts commodity group consists primarily of finished automobiles and stamped auto parts 
the other commodity group consists of all freight not included in the commodity groups set forth above  such as municipal solid waste  construction and demolition debris and haulage traffic 
haulage traffic is shipped by other rail carriers  but moves over our rail lines for a fee pursuant to contractual arrangements with those carriers 
geographic information for financial information with respect to each of our geographic areas  see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item exhibits  financial statement schedules of this annual report 
traffic rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized as interline  local or overhead traffic 
interline traffic either originates or terminates with customers located along a rail line and is interchanged with other rail carriers 
local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers 
overhead traffic passes over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the carload originating or terminating on the line 
unlike overhead traffic  interline and local traffic in north america provide us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation 
however  the open access regime in australia permits other participants in the above rail industry to compete for our existing traffic 
in  revenues generated from interline and local traffic constituted approximately of our freight revenues 
seasonality of operations some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons  either as a result of the nature of the commodity or the demand cycle for the commodity 
for instance  certain agricultural and food products  like winter wheat in canada  ship only during certain months each year 
seasonality is also reflected in our results of operations as a result of weather patterns 
typically  we experience relatively lower revenues in north america in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in north america tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials 
in addition  due to adverse winter weather conditions  we also tend to incur higher operating costs during the first and fourth quarters 
we typically initiate capital projects in north america in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable 
in addition  we experience relatively lower revenues in australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season eg  monsoonal rains in the northern territory 
employees as of december   our railroads and industrial switching locations had approximately  full time employees 
of this total  approximately  employees were union members 
our railroads have contracts with unions 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to of those agreements 
we are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional employees who are not represented by a national labor organization 
gwa has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees 
the railway labor act rla governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in the united states 
the rla establishes the right of railroad employees to organize and bargain collectively along craft or class lines and imposes a duty upon carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain collective bargaining agreements 
the canada labour code and the relevant provincial labor laws govern the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in canada 
the federal fair work act governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in australia 
the rla and foreign labor regulations contain detailed procedures that must be exhausted before a lawful work stoppage may occur 
rrf is not party to any collective bargaining agreements in the netherlands  but it is party to a collective bargaining agreement in belgium 
we believe we maintain positive working relationships with our employees 
safety our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries 
operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations  the transportation of hazardous materials  safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations 
we also participate in safety committees of the aar  governmental and industry sponsored safety programs and the american short line and regional railroad association safety committee 
g w consolidated fra reportable injury frequency rate excluding the railamerica railroads  as defined by the fra as reportable injuries per  man hours worked  was and in and  respectively 
railamerica consolidated fra reportable injury frequency rate was and in and  respectively 
on a pro forma basis  g w fra reportable injury frequency rate combined with railamerica was for the year ended december  the average injuries per  man hours worked for all united states short line railroads in the rail industry was in through november and in we expect that the extension of g w safety culture to the railamerica railroads will be a significant focus as we integrate the railamerica railroads 
insurance we maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail related services 
railamerica legacy liability and property insurance coverage will remain in place until our annual insurance renewal later in  following which it is expected that all of our operations will be covered under one insurance program 
our primary liability policies currently have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence 
railamerica primary liability policies currently have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence and prior self insured retentions have been as high as million per occurrence 
the liability policies cover sudden releases of hazardous materials  including hazardous commodities transported by rail  and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident 
personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies 
g w property damage policies have various self insured retentions  which vary based on the type and location of the incident  that are currently up to million per occurrence 
railamerica primary property damage policies have self insured retentions that are currently up to million per occurrence 
the property damage policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events 
the self insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history  the size and make up of our company and general insurance market conditions 
employees of our united states railroads are covered by the federal employers liability act fela  a fault based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation 
fela related claims are covered under our liability policies 
employees of our industrial switching and railroad construction businesses are covered under workers compensation policies 
employees of our canadian railroads are covered by the applicable provincial workers compensation policy 
employees of our australian operations are covered by the respective state based workers compensation legislation in australia 
employees of our european operations are covered by the workers compensation legislation of the netherlands and belgium  as applicable 
we believe our insurance coverage is adequate given our experience and the experience of the rail industry within the geographies we operate 
competition the unique and difficult to replicate infrastructure associated with railroads is a key benefit of the industry as compared to other modes of transportation  such as trucking which uses public highways  toll roads  etc 
and shipping which uses river systems and ports 
however  railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally highway competition from trucks and  on some routes  ships  barges and pipelines 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required  as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided 
in north america  a railroad typically is the only rail carrier directly serving a customer on its line  which is a key differentiating factor versus trucking and shipping 
most freight is interchanged between other railroads prior to reaching its final destination 
to the extent that highway competition is involved  the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes  highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights 
in australia  the netherlands and belgium  our customers have access to other rail carriers under open access regimes so we face competition from other rail carriers in addition to competition from competing modes of transportation 
to a lesser degree  we also face competition from similar products made in other areas where we are not located  a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition 
for example  a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant as compared to its paper plants in other locations 
in some instances  we face product competition  where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes eg  coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation 
in acquiring rail properties and making rail equipment and or track infrastructure investments in projects  we generally compete with other railroad operators and with various financial institutions  including private equity firms  operating in conjunction with rail operators 
competition for rail properties and investment projects is based primarily upon price and the seller s assessment of the buyer s railroad operating expertise and financing capability 
we believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and operator of rail properties  combined with our managerial and financial resources  positions us well in a competitive acquisition and investment environment 
regulation united states in addition to environmental laws  securities laws  state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses  our united states railroads are subject to regulation by stb  fra  federal agencies  including the united states department of transportation dot  occupational safety and health administration osha  mine safety and health administration msha and transportation security administration tsa  which operates under the department of homeland security dhs  state departments of transportation  and some state and local regulatory agencies 
the stb is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the interstate commerce commission icc 
established by the icc termination act of  the stb has jurisdiction over  among other things  certain freight rates where there is no effective competition  extension or abandonment of rail lines  the acquisition of rail lines and consolidation  merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers 
in limited circumstances  the stb may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees 
the fra  dot and osha have jurisdiction over safety  which includes the regulation of equipment standards  track maintenance  handling of hazardous shipments  locomotive and rail car inspection  repair requirements  operating practices and crew qualifications 
the tsa has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security 
additionally  various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law 
the stb launched wide ranging proceedings to explore whether to expand rail regulation 
the stb has not taken further action and denied a petition seeking one form of access regulation that would impact railroads ability to limit the access of other rail service providers to their rail infrastructure 
several bills were introduced in the united states senate in early that would expand the regulatory authority of the stb and could include new antitrust provisions 
additionally  a two year dot study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits  which commenced in  could result in subsequent federal legislation 
the majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at class i railroads  however  we continue to monitor these proposed bills 
the outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services  which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads  as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers 
in  the fra issued final rules governing the installation of positive train control ptc by the end of although still under development  ptc is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident 
certain of our railroads may be required to install ptc or ptc related equipment by the end of we do not expect that our compliance with the final rules governing the installation of ptc will give rise to any material financial expenditures 
canada st 
lawrence atlantic railroad quebec and ottawa valley railway are federally regulated railroads that fall under the jurisdiction of the canada transportation agency cta and transport canada tc and are subject to the railway safety act 
the cta regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways  financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies  all aspects of rates  tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines 
tc administers the railway safety act  which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment 
quebec gatineau railway and cape breton central nova scotia railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of quebec and nova scotia  respectively 
in addition  huron central railway  goderich exeter railway and southern ontario railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial government of ontario 
provincially regulated railways operate only within one province and hold a certificate of fitness delivered by a provincial authority 
in the province of quebec  the fitness certificate is delivered by the minist re des transports du quebec  while in ontario  under the shortline railways act   a license must be obtained from the registrar of shortline railways 
construction  operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated  as are railway services 
acquisitions of additional railroad operations in canada  whether federally or provincially regulated  may be subject to review under the investment canada act ica  a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a canadian business or establishment of a new canadian business by a non canadian 
in the case of an acquisition that is subject to review  a non canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ica that the investment will be of net benefit to canada  considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation 
any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to canada s competition act  which contains provisions relating to pre merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions 
australia in australia  regulation of rail safety is generally governed by state legislation and administered by state regulatory agencies 
our australian assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate 
regulation of track access is governed by federally legislated guidelines that are implemented by the states 
the state access regimes are required to be certified by the australian competition and consumer commission 
as a result  with respect to rail infrastructure access  our australian subsidiaries are subject to the state based access regimes 
in addition  certain new acquisitions in australia will also be subject to review by the foreign investment review board and the australian competition and consumer commission 
europe at the european level  several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by rail 
these directives generally cover the development of railways  allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings 
the european union eu legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach towards railway safety 
every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the european network and eu member states must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies 
these directives have been implemented in dutch railway legislation such as the railways act and in belgian railway legislation such as the law on railway safety 
in the netherlands  we are subject to regulation by the ministry of infrastructure and environment  the living environment and transport inspectorate  the dutch railways infrastructure manager  prorail  and keyrail the dutch railways infrastructure manager for the betuweroute  a dedicated freight railway connecting the port of rotterdam to the german border and within the port of rotterdam 
all railways in the netherlands must have a license and a safety certificate issued by the regulator  the human environment and transport inspectorate  part of the netherlands ministry of infrastructure and environment 
a rail operator must also have a license from prorail and or keyrail  the dutch rail infrastructure authorities  to use the rail infrastructure 
the dutch competition authority is charged with the supervision of compliance with the european community directives on the development of the railways  the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure 
in belgium  we are subject to regulation by the federal public service fps mobility and transport  the regulatory service for railway transport and for brussels airport operations  which is currently hosted by fps mobility and transport  and the belgian railways infrastructure manager  infrabel 
rail service providers based in belgium must obtain a rail operator license from the federal minister for mobility and transport 
rail service providers that wish to operate in belgium must obtain a safety certificate  which is comprised of parts a and b 
part a must be obtained from the railway safety and interoperability service ssicf if the rail service provider is based in belgium 
part b must be obtained from ssicf regardless of where the rail service provider is based 
in belgium  the belgium competition authority is responsible for promoting and safeguarding active competition in belgium 
both the dutch competition authority and the belgium competition authority work together with other competition authorities and are part of the european competition network  the european competition authorities and the international competition network 
environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
in the united states  these environmental laws and regulations  which are implemented principally by the united states environmental protection agency epa and comparable state agencies  govern the management of hazardous wastes  the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances 
the primary laws affecting our operations are the resource conservation and recovery act  regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  the clean air act  regulating air emissions  and the clean water act  regulating water discharges 
we are also indirectly affected by environmental laws that impact the operations of our customers 
in canada  environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by environment canada and by the ministry of transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level 
in australia  these functions are administered primarily by the department of transport at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state level 
in the netherlands  european  national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the ministry of infrastructure and environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level  whereas laws regulating the transportation of hazardous goods are primarily administered by the ministry of infrastructure and environment 
european  national and local environmental policies are administered within the fps health  food chain safety and environment in belgium 
our australian operations were subject to three directions issued by the department of natural resources  environment  the arts and sport of the northern territory following the december  derailment of a gwa freight train in flood waters associated with cyclone grant 
the derailment spilled freight  including copper concentrate  into the edith river edith river derailment 
the directions required us to clean up and rectify pollution  namely any and all freight that fell from the train into the edith river  and to prevent further pollution or future harm 
gwa was informed on february  that it is no longer subject to the directions 
separately  the commonwealth of australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land that we acquired from them and used by our australian operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators 
consequently  the commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing south australia environmental standards 
noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the imposition of fines  temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief  criminal prosecution or the termination of our concession in australia 
we believe our railroads operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements 
we estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
discontinued operations in august of  we completed the sale of of the share capital of ferrocarriles chiapas mayab  sa de sa fccm  our mexican operating subsidiary  to viablis  sa de sa viablis 
the net assets  results of operations and cash flows of our remaining mexican subsidiary  gw servicios sa servicios  which were classified as discontinued operations  were not material as of and for the year ended december  we do not expect any material adverse financial impact from servicios 
results of our mexican operations are included in results from discontinued operations

risk factors 
our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in our forward looking statements  including the risks described below and the risks that may be identified in future documents that are filed or furnished with the sec 
general risks associated with our business adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business 
it is difficult to predict how general global macroeconomics and business conditions will impact our business  our customers  our suppliers and freight rail transportation in general 
an economic downturn or a recession that affects the countries where we operate or to where the goods we transport are exported  could negatively impact our business 
while the global economy has recovered in recent years from the significant downturn in late and throughout  the overall rate of global recovery experienced during  and has been uneven  and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery 
the recent economic improvements may not be broad based or sustainable and may not enhance conditions in the markets relevant to us 
for instance  in australia  a significant portion of the commodities we transport are supporting economic growth and industrial development in asian countries  particularly china  and a sustained slowdown in such countries could impact us 
slower growth in china  and the resulting impact on demand for  and lower prices of  natural resources could be a factor influencing decisions to delay and cancel certain mining projects in australia 
in addition  we anticipate benefiting from development of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids from shale regions in the united states  but continued low natural gas prices could reduce such development and the benefit we could realize 
further  the united states debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns and the possibility that the united states lawmakers may be unable to effectively reduce budget deficits have increased the possibility of a new economic slowdown or recession in the united states 
moreover  the eurozone debt crisis could lead to further political and financial turmoil  and to a destabilization of financial markets and the overall financial and euro monetary system 
in addition  we are required to assess for potential impairment of non current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  including economic circumstances  indicate that the respective asset carrying amount may not be recoverable 
given the asset intensive nature of our business  weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges 
a decline in current macroeconomic and financial conditions or commodity demand from economic activity and industrialization could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our inability to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business 
we may not be able to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully 
evaluating acquisition targets gives rise to additional costs related to legal  financial  operating and industry due diligence 
in addition  acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and  to the extent financed with debt  additional interest costs 
integrating acquired businesses  including railamerica  could also result in significant unexpected costs 
further  the process of acquiring businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors  among others loss of key employees or customers  possible inconsistencies in or conflicts between standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement company wide financial  accounting  information technology and other systems  failure to maintain the safety or quality of services that have historically been provided  failure to effectively integrate employees of rail lines acquired from other entities into our regional railroad culture  unanticipated environmental or other liabilities  failure to coordinate geographically disparate organizations  and the diversion of management attention from our day to day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so 
these disruptions and difficulties  if they occur  may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings  synergies  revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short and long term effects on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations  we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings  synergies  revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition 
for example  while we expect the acquisition of railamerica to result in approximately million of annual savings and other financial and operational benefits as described in part i item i 
business of this annual report  we may be unable to realize these savings or other benefits in the time frame that we expect or at all 
expected savings and benefits are frequently based on due diligence results and on extensive analyses that involve assumptions as to future events  including general business and industry conditions  the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served  the ability to negotiate acceptable contractual arrangements  including renewals of leases with class i railroads  operating costs  competitive factors and the ongoing cost of maintaining track infrastructure  many of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict 
there is no guarantee that the due diligence results will be accurate or that the company will not discover unanticipated liabilities 
further  while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions are reasonable  they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  even if we achieve the expected benefits  we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame 
also  the cost savings and other benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies  increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions 
for example  if key employees of railamerica depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees  our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of railamerica could be reduced or delayed 
finally  the physical conditions of the assets acquired may not materialize 
accordingly  you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies 
many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies 
these acquisitions  as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company  may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition 
the due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from  or compensate us for  actual liabilities 
generally  the representations made by the sellers  other than certain representations related to fundamental matters  such as ownership of capital stock  expire within several years of the closing 
a material liability associated with an acquisition  especially where there is no right to indemnification  could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
if we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments or manage our growth effectively  then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully 
our growth strategy is based to a large extent on the selective acquisition and development of  and investment in  rail operations  both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate 
the success of this strategy will depend on  among other things the availability of suitable opportunities  the level of competition from other companies  our ability to value acquisition and investment opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those acquisitions and investments  our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with partners  and the receipt of government approvals and financial constraints or other restrictions that may be specific to the particular company or asset to be acquired 
we have experienced significant growth in the past  principally through the acquisition of additional railroads 
effective management of rapid growth presents challenges  including the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively  the need to expand our management team and staff when necessary  the need to enhance internal operating systems and controls and the ability to consistently achieve targeted returns on capital 
these challenges are more pronounced when we experience growth in numerous geographies and on a larger scale 
we may not be able to maintain similar rates of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively 
we may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments 
if we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost  then we may forego potential opportunities  which would impair the execution of our growth strategy 
since january   we have acquired interests in railroads  all of which were purchased for cash  and our growth strategy contemplates additional acquisitions 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of undrawn revolver capacity available for acquisitions or other activities  subject to maintaining compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement 
we intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria 
as in the past  we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make 
in addition  from time to time we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers 
depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements  we may need to raise substantial additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity  equity linked or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may forego potential acquisitions  which could impair the execution of our growth strategy 
we are dependent on lease agreements with class i railroads and other third parties for our operations  strategy and growth 
in north america  our rail operations are dependent  in part  on lease agreements with class i railroads and third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations 
we lease several railroads from class i carriers and other third parties under long term lease arrangements  which railroads collectively accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we also own several railroads that lease portions of the track or right of way upon which they operate from class i railroads and other third parties 
our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements 
in addition  certain of the railamerica railroads we acquired are also operated pursuant to lease agreements with class i railroads that will expire and may not be extended  which could give rise to a loss in revenues and a potential write down in the book value of our assets 
leases from class i railroads that could expire in each of the next years would represent less than of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on the estimated combined revenues of g w and railamerica for the year ended december  for example  our revenues associated with leases from class i railroads subject to expiration in each of the next five years would represent approximately    and of our revenues in each of those years  respectively  based on the estimated combined revenues of g w and railamerica for the year ended december  expiration or termination of these leases or the failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our operations served over  freight customers in freight revenues from our largest freight customers not including railamerica customers accounted for approximately of our operating revenues in six of our largest freight customers in were located in australia and accounted for approximately of our operating revenues 
in  our largest freight customer was a company in the farm and food products industry and represented approximately of our operating revenues 
freight revenues from railamerica largest freight customers accounted for approximately of its operating revenues in and its largest freight customer was a company in the steel and metals industry and represented approximately of its total revenues 
in north america  we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us  our connecting carriers and the customer 
these contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration 
these contracts establish price or  in the case of longer term contracts  a methodology for determining the price  but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume 
under these contracts  freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to changes in the prices of the commodities being shipped 
in australia  a number of our customer contracts contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing  with the variable portion based on the volumes shipped 
substantial reduction in business with or loss of important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
because we depend on class i railroads and other connecting carriers for a significant portion of our operations in north america  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate 
the railroad industry in the united states and canada is dominated by seven class i carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage 
in  approximately of our total carloads in the united states and canada were interchanged with class i carriers 
a decision by any of these class i carriers to cease certain freight movements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected 
in addition  class i carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us  as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators 
our ability to provide rail service to customers in the united states and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to lease arrangements  freight rates  revenue divisions  fuel surcharges  car supply  reciprocal switching  interchange and trackage rights 
deterioration in the operations of  or service provided by  those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our inability to obtain government funding 
certain of our existing capital projects are  and certain of our future capital projects may be  partially or completely funded through government grant programs 
during  we obtained government funding for separate projects that were partially or completely funded by united states and canadian federal  state  provincial and municipal agencies 
the spending associated with these grant funded projects represented approximately of our total capital expenditures during government funding for projects is limited  and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal  state  provincial and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability 
in addition  competition for government funding from other short line railroads  class i railroads and other companies is significant  and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing 
in certain jurisdictions  the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations  such as compliance with prevailing wage requirements 
if we are unable to obtain adequate government funding  we may have to defer or forgo certain capital projects  incur additional debt or use additional cash 
our results of operations and rail structure are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences 
we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions  including floods  fires  hurricanes or cyclones  tornadoes  droughts  earthquakes and other natural occurrences 
for example  bad weather and natural disasters  such as blizzards in the northeastern united states and canada and hurricanes or cyclones in the united states and australia  and resulting floods  could cause a shutdown  derailment or other substantial disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations  it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers 
for example our minerals and stone freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern united states  which lessen demand for road salt 
our coal and coke freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the united states  which lessen demand for coal 
our revenues generated by our australian operations are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions on the south australian grain harvest and the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the northern territory 
furthermore  our expenses could be adversely impacted by such weather conditions  including  for example  higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter at our railroads in the northern united states and canada related to snow removal and mandated work breaks 
such weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations 
the failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and to a variety of health  safety  security  labor  environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
in the united states  these agencies include the stb  dot  fra of the dot  msha  osha  epa  dhs and other federal and state agencies 
in australia  we are subject to both commonwealth and state regulations 
in canada  we are subject to regulation by the cta  tc and the regulatory departments of the provincial governments of quebec  ontario and nova scotia 
in the netherlands  we are subject to regulation by the ministry of transport  public works and water management  the transport  public works and water management inspectorate and the dutch railways managers  prorail and keyrail 
in belgium  we are subject to regulation by the federal public service fps mobility and transport  the regulatory service for railway transport and for brussels airport operations  which is currently hosted by fps mobility and transport  and the belgian railways infrastructure manager  infrabel 
see part i item business regulation for a discussion of these regulations 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
there are various legislative and regulatory actions that have been considered in the united states in recent years  including legislation to modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry 
in addition  various proceedings have been initiated by the stb related to rail competition  interchange commitments and competitive access 
a two year dot study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits also commenced in  and could result in subsequent federal legislation 
the majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at class i railroads  however  specific initiatives being considered by congress and the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services  which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads  as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers 
the cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant 
in the other geographies in which we operate  federal  state  provincial and local regulatory authorities could change the regulatory framework including the access regimes or take actions without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes or actions could have on our business  including  without limitation  regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads 
significant legislative or regulatory activity could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services  which could reduce capital spending on our rail network  facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our senior secured syndicated facility agreement the new credit agreement contains numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business 
our new credit agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire capital stock or indebtedness  make investments  loans  advances and acquisitions  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  create liens  sell assets  including capital stock of any of our subsidiaries  consolidate or merge  enter into sale leaseback transactions  change the business conducted by us and the guarantors  change our fiscal year  and enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations 
our new credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and tests 
our failure to comply with the obligations in our new credit agreement and other debt agreements could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the new credit agreement or other debt agreements  as applicable  which  if not cured or waived  could permit lenders to accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on the assets securing such debt  if any 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had a total indebtedness of billion  and we had unused commitments of million under our new credit agreement after giving effect to million of undrawn letters of credit which reduces such availability 
subject to the limits contained in the new credit agreement and our other debt instruments  we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital  capital expenditures  investments or acquisitions  or for other purposes 
if we do so  the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify 
specifically  our high level of debt could have important consequences  including the following making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate requirements  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes  thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings  including borrowings under the new creditagreement  are at variable rates of interest  limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete  placing us at a disadvantage compared to other  less leveraged competitors  and increasing our cost of borrowing 
in addition  the new credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all our debt and foreclosure on the assets securing such debt  if any 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties  and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to credit risk 
there is a risk that customers or counterparties  which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions  will fail to meet their obligations when due 
customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
for interline traffic  one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route 
the invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis 
when we are the invoicing railroad  therefore  we are exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and we are required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if we are not paid by the customer 
we have procedures for reviewing our receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties  however  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee 
certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets  customers or other matters 
this information may not  in all cases  be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
in addition  we may make substantial investments in equipment and assets to support our customers  in particular those in the mining and natural resources industry  before the customer commences operations 
in those cases  we may be exposed to start up risks that we would not be exposed to in respect of customers with active operations 
as a result  unexpected credit exposures or start up delays could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we face competition from numerous sources  including those relating to geography  substitute products  other types of transportation and other rail operators 
in north america  each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers 
in certain circumstances  including under the open access regimes in australia  the netherlands and belgium  our customers have direct access to other rail carriers 
in addition  our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally trucks and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
transportation providers such as trucks and barges utilize public rights of way that are built and maintained by governmental entities  while we must build and maintain our own network infrastructure 
competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for trucks with respect to size or weight restrictions 
we are also subject to geographic and product competition 
a customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations 
also  commodities that are not transported by rail could be substituted for another commodity that we transport by rail 
for example  natural gas can compete with coal we transport as a fuel source for electricity generation 
in either case  we could lose a source of revenues 
the extent of competition varies significantly among our railroads 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged  the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required 
in addition  competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided 
because a significant portion of our carloads in the united states and canada involve interchange with another carrier  we have only limited control over the total price  transit time or quality of such service 
it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business  since not only each customer  but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition 
however  changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
for information on the competition associated with the open access regimes in australia and europe  see additional risks associated with our foreign operations 
market and regulatory responses to climate change could adversely affect our operating costs 
market and regulatory responses to climate change  as well as its physical impacts  could materially affect us 
for example  federal  state and local laws  regulations  restrictions  caps  taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases  including diesel exhaust  could significantly increase our operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations to the extent they apply to our diesel locomotives  equipment  vehicles and machinery or our rail yards 
market and regulatory responses to climate change  including the closure of coal fired power plants we serve  climate change litigation and climate change itself could decrease demand for the commodities we transport and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
restrictions on emissions could affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy  that use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry  or that manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels  including  for example  coal mining operations  natural gas developers and producers  coal fired power plants  chemical producers  farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers 
significant cost increases  government regulation  or changes in consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry  such as by resulting in the closure of coal fired power plants that we serve  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns  including  for example  the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers 
finally  we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change including claims alleging impact of our operations on climate change 
any such market or regulatory responses or litigation  as well as physical impacts attributed to climate change and global warming  such as floods  rising sea levels and increasingly frequent and intense storms  individually or in conjunction with one or more of the impacts discussed above or other unforeseen impacts of climate change  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we could incur significant costs for violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations 
our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to waters  the handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous materials including lading or petroleum releases 
we generate and transport hazardous and non hazardous waste in our operations 
we may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us  properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties for example  properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated  stored  spilled or disposed  as well as at properties currently owned or operated by us 
under some environmental statutes  such liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be joint and several  whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we or the entity that gives rise to our liability may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability 
environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties  other third parties affected by environmental conditions for example  contractors and current or former employees seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death  and or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations 
environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs  including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
as a common carrier by rail  we are required to transport hazardous materials  regardless of cost or risk 
transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury  property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads 
in addition  insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities 
also  federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations 
for instance  existing legislation requires pre notification for hazardous materials shipments 
such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads 
additionally  regulations adopted by the dot and the dhs could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads 
further  certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders 
such ordinances could require the re routing of hazardous materials shipments  with the potential for significant additional costs 
increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we have insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences 
unexpected or catastrophic circumstances associated with derailments of valuable lading  accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials or other incidents involving our operations could cause our losses to exceed our insurance coverage limits or sub limits 
in addition  on certain of the rail lines over which we operate  freight trains are commingled with passenger trains 
for instance  in oregon  our portland western railroad operates certain passenger trains for the tri county metropolitan transportation district of oregon and our new england central railroad is also used by amtrak for passenger service in new england 
further  we operate excursion trains on behalf of third parties on certain of the rail lines over which we operate 
derailments  collisions or other incidents involving us and passenger or excursion trains could give rise to losses that exceed our insurance coverage 
also  insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers  and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at current levels or at all or obtain it on terms acceptable to us 
deteriorating insurance market conditions caused by global property casualties and subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us  including such things as derailments  accidents  discharge of toxic or hazardous materials  or other like occurrences in the industry  may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and or our self insured retentions  volatility in our claims expenses and limitations to the coverage under our existing policies and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future 
even with insurance  if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs  we may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to operations which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
exposure to market risks  particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate these and other risks could adversely impact our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
it is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
from time to time  we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks 
for instance  we have entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the floating interest rate payments under our new credit agreement 
while these financial instruments reduce our exposure to market risks  the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement and may have significant costs associated with early termination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs 
in  g w and railamerica consumed million gallons and million gallons of diesel fuel  respectively 
fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations 
if a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments  disruption of oil imports  disruption of domestic refinery production  damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure  political unrest  war or otherwise  diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations 
in addition  diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
currently  we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset fuel prices 
however  if class i railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges  the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease and could have a negative effect on our profitability 
costs for fuel used in operations were approximately and of our operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments  a disruption of oil imports or otherwise  these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 
the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment  personal injury  freight loss  property damage and other matters 
for example  united states job related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to fela  which is applicable only to railroads 
fela fault based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault worker compensation system 
the variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded 
any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage  personal injury and environmental liability that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
some of our employees belong to labor unions  and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states  australia  canada and belgium 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to of those agreements 
approximately  of our approximately  full time employees are union members 
we have also entered into employee association agreements with an additional employees who are not represented by a national labor organization 
gwa has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees 
our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized  or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and or higher ongoing labor costs 
a substantial majority of the employees of the class i railroads with which we interchange are unionized 
if such class i railroads were to have a work stoppage or strike  the national rail network and our operations would be adversely affected 
to date  we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages 
additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility 
if we are unable to employ a sufficient number of qualified workers  or attract and retain senior leadership  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities 
the operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh and remote conditions  resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries 
the challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce  training requirements and significant competition for specialized trades 
within the next five years  we estimate that approximately of our current workforce  including employees we obtained from the recent railamerica acquisition  will become eligible for retirement 
many of these workers hold key operating positions  such as conductors  engineers and mechanics 
in addition  the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased  especially from class i railroads  which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits 
a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both 
in addition  if key employees of railamerica depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees  our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of railamerica could be reduced or delayed 
finally  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain senior leadership necessary to manage and grow our business 
the loss of any key personnel could require the remaining key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement 
the loss of the services of any of our senior leadership  and the inability to find a suitable replacement  could adversely affect our operating  acquisition and investment strategies 
our ability to manage all of these risks is further complicated by the geographic diversity of our operations 
if any of these events were to occur  our cost structure could increase  our profit margins could decrease and our growth strategy could be impaired 
our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain rail cars  locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers 
due to the capital intensive nature and industry specific requirements of the rail industry  there are high barriers to entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as rail cars  locomotives and track materials 
if the number of available rail cars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these rail cars either through lease or purchase increases  we might not be able to obtain rail cars on favorable terms  or at all  and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation 
as of january   according to the aar  approximately of the north american railcar fleet was in storage 
in some cases we use third party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and such locomotives may not be available 
without these third party locomotives  we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives 
even if purchased  there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay 
for example  in australia the availability of new locomotives is limited  with long lead times for delivery 
additionally  we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials  such as rail and ties 
changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could limit our ability to support new projects and achieve our growth strategy 
we may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti terrorism measures 
our rail lines  port operations and other facilities and equipment  including rail cars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier  could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks 
any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service  which could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
additional risks associated with our foreign operations we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries  namely in australia  canada  the netherlands and belgium 
in addition  we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include adverse changes or greater volatility in the economies of those countries  adverse currency movements that make goods produced in those countries that are destined for export markets less competitive  adverse effects due to changes in the eurozone membership  adverse changes to the regulatory environment or access regimes of those countries  adverse changes to the tax laws and regulations of those countries  restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment  or a decrease in the value of repatriated cash flows  a decrease in the value of foreign sourced income as a result of exchange rate changes  the actual or perceived failure by us to fulfill commitments under concession agreements  the ability to identify and retain qualified local managers  and the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation 
because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
our operations in australia  canada and europe accounted for   and of our consolidated operating revenues  respectively  for the year ended december  on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the acquisition of railamerica  our operations in australia  canada and europe accounted for  and of our long lived assets  respectively  as of december  the results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the euro and then translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the united states dollar can impact our results of operations 
the financial statements of the company s foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into united states dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and  for the statement of operations  at the average rate for the statement period 
the exchange rates between these currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future 
we may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively  and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  because our financial statements are stated in united states dollars  such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
our concession and or lease agreements in australia could be cancelled  and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms 
through our subsidiaries in australia  we have entered into long term concession and or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the northern territory and south australia 
our concession agreement for the tarcoola to darwin rail line expires in and our lease agreement for our other south australia rail lines expires in if our concession or lease agreements expire  we will no longer act as the below rail access provider  but will still be permitted to participate in the above rail market 
these concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions  including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service  price and the environment 
these concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures  which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections 
our failure to meet these commitments under the long term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements 
the termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our investment relating to that concession or lease agreement 
further  the expiration of these agreements and the end of their term would result in the loss of the associated revenues and income 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
open access regimes in australia and europe could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins 
the legislative and regulatory framework in australia allows third party rail operators to gain access to our australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others 
the netherlands and belgium also have open access regimes that permit third party rail operators to compete for the business of rrf  our subsidiary in the netherlands 
there are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business 
the loss of our customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
changes to the open access regimes in australia and europe could have a significant impact on our operations 
access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change 
where we pay access fees to others  if those fees were increased  our operating margins could be negatively affected 
in australia  if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third party rail freight operators by our australian railroads did not meet competitive standards  our income from those fees could decline 
in addition  when we operate over track networks owned by others  the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition 
therefore  in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others  our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained 
revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession 
our operating subsidiaries in australia  the netherlands and belgium hold safety accreditations that are required in order for them to provide freight rail services 
continued maintenance of our safety accreditation in australia is a requirement under our concession deeds and some customer contracts 
these safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal 
following significant derailments  the government entities responsible for oversight of rail safety frequently perform investigations 
any loss of  failure to maintain or inability to renew  rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction  or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight  including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operational performance and financial results 
changes to the mining tax regime in australia could have a negative impact on our existing customers and the prospects for new customer initiatives underway 
the australian government approved a new minerals resource rent tax mrrt that was effective as of july  the mrrt is a tax on profits generated from the exploitation of certain non renewable resources in australia 
the implementation of the mrrt could result in an increase in operating costs for mining assets based in australia 
the tax could also have an adverse effect on our australian operations by reducing the volume of commodities mined in australia for us to transport  as well as by reducing levels of demand for australian commodities and our transportation of those commodities 
consequently  the introduction of the mrrt could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
risks related to taxation our ability to use railamerica section g tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation due to a change in the ownership of its stock 
as of december   railamerica had tax benefits totaling approximately million of section g tax credit carryforwards and federal net operating loss carryforwards 
under sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change  the corporation ability to use its pre change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset its post change income may be limited and may result in a partial or full write down of the related deferred tax assets 
an ownership change is defined generally for these purposes as a greater than change in ownership over a three year period  taking into account shareholders that own or more by value of our common stock 
while we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these tax attributes  our acquisition of railamerica may limit our ability to use railamerica net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future tax liabilities 
the united states short line tax credit expires on december  as a result  our effective tax rate in will be higher if the credit is not extended 
since  we have benefited from the effects of the united states short line tax credit  which is an income tax credit for class ii and class iii railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures the short line tax credit 
qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track  including roadbed  bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a class ii or class iii railroad 
the credit is equal to of the qualified expenditures  subject to an annual limitation of  multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the class ii or class iii railroad as of the end of their tax year 
on january   the short line tax credit which had previously expired on december  was extended for and the most recent extension of the short line tax credit only extended the credit through december  if the short line tax credit is not extended for additional tax years  the loss of the credit will increase our effective tax rate and reduce our reported earnings per share 
if the earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries were required to be distributed  our effective tax rate could be higher 
we file a consolidated united states federal income tax return that includes all of our united states subsidiaries 
each of our foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of their respective countries 
no provision is made for the united states income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of those earnings was million as of december  although it is our current intention to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of our controlled foreign subsidiaries  if the earnings were required to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to united states income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries  and could result in a higher effective tax rate for us  thereby reducing our earnings 
see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources cash repatriation for additional information 
non us holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to united states federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of the shares of class a common stock 
it is possible that we are a united states real property holding corporation currently or will become one in the future for united states federal income tax purposes

item properties 
genesee wyoming  through our subsidiaries  currently has interests in freight railroads 
of these  are short line railroads and one is a regional freight railroad  including located in the united states  seven located in canada  one located in australia and one located in the netherlands and belgium 
we also operate the tarcoola to darwin rail line  which links the port of darwin to the australian interstate rail network in south australia 
these rail properties typically consist of the track and the underlying land 
real estate adjacent to the railroad rights of way is generally owned by others  and our holdings of such real estate are not material 
similarly  sellers typically retain mineral rights and rights to grant fiber optic and other easements in the properties acquired by us 
several of our railroads are operated under leases or operating licenses in which we do not assume ownership of the track or the underlying land 
our railroads operate over approximately  miles of track that is owned  jointly owned or leased by us  which includes the tarcoola to darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in several of our railroads are operated pursuant to lease agreements that will expire and may not be extended in the next few years 
leases from class i railroads that could expire in each of the next years would represent less than of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on the estimated combined revenues of g w and railamerica for the year ended december  for additional information on these lease expirations see item a 
risk factors of this annual report 
we also operate  through various trackage and operating rights agreements  over  additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others under contractual track access arrangements

in connection with our acquisition of railamerica  five putative stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in  three in the court of chancery of the state of delaware delaware court and two in the circuit court of the fourth judicial circuit for duval county  florida  civil division florida circuit court  against railamerica  the railamerica directors and genesee wyoming 
the two lawsuits filed in the florida circuit court alleged  among other things  that the railamerica directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their decision to sell railamerica to genesee wyoming via an allegedly flawed process and failed to obtain the best financial and other terms and that railamerica and genesee wyoming aided and abetted those alleged breaches of duty 
the complaints requested  among other relief  an order to enjoin consummation of the merger and attorneys fees 
on july   plaintiffs in the florida actions filed a motion to consolidate the two florida actions  appoint plaintiffs langan and sambuco as lead plaintiffs and appoint lead counsel in the proposed consolidated action 
plaintiffs in the florida actions also filed an emergency motion for expedited proceedings on august  and an amended complaint on august   which included allegations that the information statement filed by railamerica on august   omitted material information about the proposed merger 
on august   the parties in the florida actions submitted a stipulation for expedited proceedings  which the florida circuit court ordered on august  the three lawsuits filed in delaware court named the same defendants  alleged substantially similar claims  and sought similar relief as the florida actions 
the parties to the delaware actions submitted orders of dismissal in november  which the delaware court has granted 
on december   solely to avoid the costs  risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation  and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing  we and the other parties to the florida actions executed a stipulation and agreement of compromise  settlement and release to settle all related claims 
the settlement is not material and is subject to  among other things  final approval by the florida circuit court 
on january   the florida circuit court gave preliminary approval of the settlement and scheduled a hearing on final approval of the settlement for may  in addition to the lawsuits set forth above  from time to time  we are a defendant in certain lawsuits resulting from our operations in the ordinary course 
management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any probable liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits 
based upon currently available information  we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to our results of operations or have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial statements were determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
g w acquired railamerica on october  however  the shares of railamerica were held in a voting trust while the stb considered our control application  which application was approved with an effective date of december  accordingly  we accounted for the earnings of railamerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is included in our consolidated balance sheet at december  therefore  unless specifically identified to the contrary  references to income statement line items  such as revenues and expenses  do not include railamerica 
we have included separate disclosure of railamerica income statement line items to the extent we believe such context is warranted 
because of the significance of charges related to the railamerica acquisition and other matters described herein  in addition to disclosing results for the years ended december  and  respectively  that are determined in accordance with us gaap  we also disclose non gaap financial measures that exclude these charges from income from continuing operations  net income  diluted earnings per share  operating income and operating ratio 
we are presenting non gaap financial measures excluding these items because we believe it is useful for investors in assessing our financial results compared with the same period in the prior year 
within the text  in connection with each non gaap financial measure presented  we have presented the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with us gaap and have provided a reconciliation of the differences between the non gaap financial measure with its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
outlook for safety operating a safe railroad benefits our employees  our customers  our shareholders and the communities we serve 
we have led the railroad industry in safety for the past four years and our goal for is continuous improvement in safety and a consolidated injury frequency ratio of reportable injuries per  man hours 
we have a significant challenge and opportunity as we integrate the railamerica railroads and implement our safety culture  with the ultimate goal of having zero injuries 
financial expectations north america and europe we expect that the most significant impact on our financial results in will be the acquisition of railamerica 
primarily as a result of the acquisition  we anticipate revenues from our north america and europe reporting segment to increase significantly in in addition to the impact of the railamerica acquisition  we expect growth in our same railroad freight revenues due to increases in traffic across most of our commodity groups 
in particular  we anticipate growth in petroleum products traffic due to new crude oil and natural gas liquids customers 
we expect coal traffic to remain stable and agricultural products traffic to decrease due to the impact of drought on the united states grain harvest 
australia we expect revenue and operating income growth from the continued ramp up of our new standard gauge iron ore service that commenced in the fourth quarter of we also anticipate the delivery of new narrow gauge locomotives in the first quarter of and the expansion of our narrow gauge iron ore service in the second quarter of  which is expected to improve our australian financial results 
we expect our intermodal revenues to increase in as a result of a reduction in slow orders on the track  increased operational efficiency and new business  as well as the non recurrence of the disruptions caused by the edith river bridge incident in late december capital plan we expect to make capital investments totaling approximately million in of this total  million is planned for ongoing railroad track and equipment capital  million is planned for matching capital spending associated with government grant funded projects in eight of our north american operating regions all except for mountain west and million is planned for specific projects  including certain track upgrades and locomotive lease buyouts 
in addition  we expect to spend million on business development related capital  primarily new locomotives for our operations in australia  the construction of a new rail spur in canada and track improvements in the united states 
united states short line tax credit an extension of the short line tax credit for the and tax years was passed in january as a result  our financial results will include the tax credits for both the and tax years 
we expect the extension of the short line tax credit to produce book income tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively  for fiscal years and because the extension became law in  the impact will be recorded in the first quarter of corporate and business development in addition to the integration of the railamerica acquisition  we will continue to work on a number of potential projects located across the geographic markets in which we currently operate 
for example  in australia and canada  we will continue to work on additional bulk minerals export projects 
in the united states  opportunities to acquire additional short line railroads are numerous 
in addition  we expect with the expanded rail footprint provided by the railamerica acquisition  we will increase our industrial development focus with the goal of adding new customers and or facilities to our railroads 
specific areas of focus will be on shale oil and gas related projects as well as on additional energy and industrial projects related to coal  wood pellets and biomass 
in addition  we may explore acquisitions in countries or markets in which we do not operate currently

our subsidiary  gwa  historically operated freightlink s rail haulage services  provided its crews  managed its train operations and leased locomotives and wagons to freightlink 
prior to the completion of the tarcoola to darwin rail line in  potential mining projects located in the northern territory had no economically viable transportation link to an export port 
since the completion of the rail line  there has been an increase in mineral exploration and development in the northern territory and south australia along the rail corridor 
we believe the freightlink acquisition provides us significant organic growth opportunities as it positions us to capitalize on future mineral development in the northern territory and south australia

huron central railway inc in june  we announced that our subsidiary  huron central railway inc hcry  intended to cease its operations in the third quarter of consequently  in the second quarter of  we recorded charges of million after tax associated with hcry 
these charges reflected a non cash write down of non current assets of million and restructuring charges of million and were partially offset by a tax benefit of million

purchase price allocation we accounted for the railamerica  azer and freightlink acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under us gaap 
under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities of railamerica were recorded at their respective estimated acquisition date fair values by railamerica as of october   which is referred to as the application of push down accounting  and were included in g w consolidated balance sheet in a single line item following the equity method of accounting as of that date see railamerica as of october  column in the following table 
upon receipt of approval from the stb to control railamerica  our preliminary allocation of fair value to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were consolidated with our assets and liabilities as of december  see railamerica as of december  column in the following table 
between october  and december   we recognized income from our equity investment in railamerica of million and other comprehensive loss of million  primarily resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments 
in addition  we recognized million  representing the change in railamerica cash and cash equivalents from october  to december   as a reduction in net cash paid for the acquisition 
the final allocation of fair value to railamerica assets and liabilities is subject to completion of an assessment of the acquisition date fair values of acquired non current assets  deferred taxes and other tax matters  and contingent liabilities 
the assets and liabilities of azer and freightlink were recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values and were consolidated with those of g w as of their respective acquisition dates see azer and freightlink columns in the following table 
the foreign exchange rate used to translate the freightlink balance sheet to united states dollars was for one australian dollar which was the exchange rate on december  
the fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of railamerica  azer and freightlink were as follows dollars in thousands railamerica freightlink as of october  as of december  azer aud usd purchase price allocations cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable materials and supplies prepaid expenses and other deferred income tax assets  net property and equipment goodwill intangible assets other assets total assets accounts payable and accrued expenses long term debt deferred income tax liabilities  net other long term liabilities noncontrolling interest net assets discontinued operations in august  we recognized income from net insurance proceeds of million million after tax within discontinued operations related to damages incurred as a result of hurricane stan in by our mexican operating subsidiary  fccm  which we sold in august we utilized capital loss carryforwards  which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance  to offset the tax on this gain 
the net assets  results of operations and cash flows of servicios  which were classified as discontinued operations  were not material as of and for the years ended december   and we do not expect any material future adverse financial impact from servicios 
results from continuing operations when comparing our results from continuing operations from one reporting period to another  consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to economic conditions  acquisitions  competitive forces  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  one time freight moves  fuel price fluctuations  customer plant expansions and shut downs  sales of property and equipment  derailments and weather related conditions  such as hurricanes  cyclones  tornadoes  droughts  heavy snowfall  unseasonably warm or cool weather  freezing and flooding 
in periods when these events occur  results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another 
finally  certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions  such as steel products  paper products and lumber and forest products as well as product specific economic conditions  such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation coal 
other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors  such as inventory levels maintained at customer plants coal  winter weather salt and coal and seasonal rainfall grain 
as a result of these and other factors  our operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our operating results in other reporting periods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating revenues overview operating revenues were million in the year ended december   compared with million in the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the million increase in operating revenues consisted of million in revenues from new operations and a million  or  increase in revenues from existing operations 
new operations are those that were not included in our consolidated financial results for a comparable period in the prior year 
the million increase in revenues from existing operations included increases of million in freight revenues and million in non freight revenues

the same railroad traffic decrease was principally due to decreases of  carloads of other commodity group traffic primarily overhead coal haulage traffic   carloads of coal and coke traffic   carloads of farm and food products traffic and  carloads of minerals and stone traffic  partially offset by increases of  carloads of metallic ores traffic   carloads of lumber and forest products traffic and  carloads of intermodal traffic 
all remaining traffic increased by a net  carloads 
average freight revenues per carload increased to in compared with average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased to changes in the commodity mix and higher fuel surcharges increased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by and  respectively  partially offset by the net depreciation of the australian and canadian dollars relative to the united states dollar  which decreased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 
other than the impacts from these factors  average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased by 
average freight revenues per carload were also positively impacted by the changes in the mix of customers within certain commodity groups  primarily coal and coke traffic  metals traffic and other commodities

farm and food products revenues decreased million  or 
farm and food products traffic volume decreased  carloads  or  which decreased revenues by million  while average revenues per carload increased  which increased revenues by million 
the carload decrease was primarily due to a mechanical failure at an export grain terminal in australia and a modal shift from rail to truck in the southern united states

the conversion price of the series a preferred stock was set at approximately  which was a premium to our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the railamerica acquisition 
for the period between july  and september   this instrument was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark to market non cash income or expense included in our consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability 
our closing price was on september   which was the last trading day prior to issuing the series a preferred stock  and  accordingly  we recorded a million non cash mark to market expense related to the investment agreement for the year ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further details on the contingent forward sale contract and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for details regarding the conversion of the series a preferred stock 
provision for income taxes the million mark to market expense associated with the contingent forward sale contract included in our income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  is a non deductible expense for income tax purposes 
as a result  our provision for income tax was million for the year ended december   which represents of income from continuing operations other than the mark to market expense 
our effective income tax rate was in the year ended december  the increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the expiration of the short line tax credit on december  on january   the short line tax credit was extended for and we expect the extension of the short line tax credit to produce book income tax benefits of approximately million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
since the extension became law in  the impact will be recorded in the first quarter of income and earnings per share from continuing operations income from continuing operations  net of tax  in the year ended december  was million  compared with income from continuing operations  net of tax  of million in the year ended december  our income from continuing operations  net of tax  in the year ended december  included the million mark to market expense associated with the contingent forward sale contract

the weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended december  included  shares as a result of the public offering of class a common stock and  shares as a result of the public offering of teus  which both took place in september of segment information our various railroad lines are organized into operating regions 
since all of the regions have similar characteristics  they previously had been aggregated into one reportable segment 
beginning january   we decided to present our financial information as two reportable segments north american european operations and australian operations 
the results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the euro and then translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements

as more fully described in note and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the acquisition of railamerica was financed through borrowings under the new credit agreement  public offerings of shares of our class a common stock and tangible equity units teus and a private issuance of series a preferred stock to carlyle 
on september   we completed a public offering of  shares of our class a common stock at per share  which included  shares issued as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option

we received net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses related to the offering 
we used the net proceeds from the offerings to partially fund the acquisition of railamerica on october  as part of the financing for the railamerica acquisition  on october   we completed the issuance of  shares of series a preferred stock at an issuance price of  per share to carlyle pursuant to the investment agreement 
the net proceeds from this issuance were million after issuance costs 
dividends on the series a preferred stock are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to per annum of the issuance price per share 
each share of the series a preferred stock was convertible at any time  at the option of the holder  into approximately shares of class a common stock  subject to customary conversion adjustments 
the series a preferred stock was also convertible into the relevant number of shares of class a common stock on the second anniversary of the date of issuance  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
furthermore  we had the option to convert some or all of the series a preferred stock prior to the second anniversary of the date of issuance of the series a preferred stock if the closing price of our class a common stock on the new york stock exchange exceeds of the conversion price or for consecutive trading days  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the conversion price of the series a preferred stock was set at approximately  which was a premium to our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the railamerica acquisition

tangible equity units teus on september   we issued  teus 
each teu initially consisted of a prepaid stock purchase contract purchase contract and a senior amortizing note due october  amortizing note issued by us  which had an initial principal amount of per amortizing note 
as of december   the amortizing notes had an aggregate principal amount of million 
on each january  april  july and october  we are required to pay holders of amortizing notes equal quarterly installments of per amortizing note except for the january  installment payment  which was per amortizing note  which cash payments in the aggregate will be equivalent to a cash payment per year with respect to each stated amount of the teus 
each installment constitutes a payment of interest at an annual rate of and a partial repayment of principal on the amortizing note 
the amortizing notes have a scheduled final installment payment date of october  if we elect to settle the purchase contracts early  holders of the amortizing notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holders amortizing notes  except in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the amortizing notes 
unless settled or redeemed earlier  each purchase contract will automatically settle on october  subject to postponement in certain limited circumstances and we will deliver a number of shares of our class a common stock based on the applicable market value of our class a common stock  as defined in the purchase contract  which will be between shares and shares subject to adjustment per each stated amount of the teus based on our share price at the time of settlement 
each teu may be separated into its constituent purchase contract and amortizing note after the initial issuance date of the teu  and the separate components may be combined to create a teu 
the amortizing note component of the teu is recorded as debt and the purchase contract component of the teu is recorded in equity as additional paid in capital 
on september   we recorded million  the initial fair value of the purchase contracts  as additional paid in capital  and was partially offset by million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflect the weighted average shares issuable upon settlement of the purchase contract component of the teus 
for purposes of determining the number of shares included in the calculation  we used the market price of our class a common stock at the period end date 
railamerica acquisition and related financing on october   we announced the closing of our acquisition of railamerica and entered into the new credit agreement  which is comprised of a billion term loan and a million revolving loan 
the acquisition was financed through borrowings under the new credit agreement  public offerings of shares of our class a common stock and teus and a private issuance of series a preferred stock to carlyle

we file a consolidated united states federal income tax return that includes all of our united states subsidiaries 
each of our foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of their respective countries 
no provision is made for the united states income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries 
if the earnings were to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to united states income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries  however  the amount of the tax and credits is not practically determinable 
the amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of december  was million

under the new credit agreement we must have an interest coverage ratio of at least to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 
in addition  we may not exceed specified maximum total leverage ratios as described in the following table period maximum total leverage ratio closing date through september  to december  through september  to december  through september  to december  and thereafter to as of december   we were in compliance with the provisions of the covenant requirements of the new credit agreement 
as of december   our million revolving loan consisted of million of outstanding debt  subsidiary letters of credit guarantees of million and million of unused borrowing capacity 
subject to maintaining compliance with the covenants in the new credit agreement  the million of unused borrowing capacity as of december  is available for working capital  capital expenditures  permitted investments  permitted acquisitions  refinancing existing indebtedness and general corporate purposes 
on july   we entered into the prior credit agreement which replaced our credit agreement then in effect 
the prior credit agreement expanded the borrowing capacity of our senior credit facility from million to million and extended the maturity date to july  the prior credit agreement included a million revolving loan  a million united states term loan  an a million million at the july  exchange rate australian term loan and a c million million at the july  exchange rate canadian term loan 
the prior credit agreement allowed for borrowings in united states dollars  australian dollars  canadian dollars and euros 
as described above  in connection with the railamerica acquisition  we repaid in full all outstanding loans  together with interest and all other amounts due under the prior credit agreement 
no penalties were due in connection with such repayments 
in connection with the repayment of the prior credit agreement  we wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs and incurred million of legal expenses

non interest bearing loan in  as part of the freightlink acquisition  we assumed debt with a carrying value of a million or million at the exchange rate on december   which represented the fair value of an a million or million at the exchange rate on december  non interest bearing loan due in as of december   the carrying value of the loan was million with an effective interest rate of 
edith river derailment on december   a train operated by our subsidiary  gwa  derailed on the edith river bridge in australia northern territory the edith river derailment 
flood waters associated with heavy rainfall from cyclone grant washed away the southern portion of the edith river bridge while a northbound gwa intermodal train consisting of three locomotives  an unoccupied crew van and wagons was passing over the bridge en route to darwin 
the locomotives were damaged and the crew van and several intermodal containers and wagons containing copper concentrate were derailed into the river 
the railroad segment between katherine and darwin remained out of service for approximately days 
the edith river bridge reopened on february  the day closure of the edith river bridge reduced our revenues by approximately million  primarily in the first quarter of in june  we recorded a gain on insurance recoveries and a related insurance receivable of a million or million at the average exchange rate on june  for a business interruption claim 
this recovery represents a partial recovery of the total expected business interruption claim 
additional recovery is expected in in december  we recorded a liability of a million or million at the exchange rate on december  for the estimated repair and related costs associated with the edith river derailment 
since we believe substantially all of these costs will be recovered through insurance  we also recorded a receivable of a million or million at the exchange rate on december   with the difference representing our insurance deductible 
we increased our estimate of costs associated with the edith river derailment  as well as our estimate of insurance recovery  each by a million or million at the exchange rate on december  during the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   we made cash payments of a million or million at the average exchange rate during the period as a result of the derailment and received cash proceeds from insurance of a million or million at the exchange rate on the date received 
as of december   our outstanding insurance receivable associated with repair costs was a million or million at the exchange rate on december  
we believe it is possible that additional claims related to the edith river derailment may arise and additional costs may be incurred 
we are unable to estimate the range of such claims based on currently available information 
however  we do not anticipate that these additional claims or costs  if any  will have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
equipment and property leases we enter into operating leases for rail cars  locomotives and other equipment 
as of december   we leased  rail cars and locomotives not including railamerica leased locomotives 
related operating lease expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   railamerica leased  rail cars and locomotives 
we lease certain real property  which resulted in operating lease expense for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
we are party to several lease agreements with class i carriers to operate over various rail lines in north america 
certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments 
under certain other of these leases  no payments to the lessors are required as long as certain operating conditions are met 
no material payments were required under these lease agreements in grants from outside parties our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal  provincial  state and local agencies and other outside parties eg  customers for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives 
we use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs 
in return for the grants  the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed 
we believe the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable 
however  we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that even if available  our railroads will be able to obtain them 
budgeted capital expenditures the following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ended december  dollars in thousands budgeted capital expenditures track and equipment improvements  self funded track and equipment improvements  subject to third party funding new business development specific projects grants from outside parties net budgeted capital expenditures we have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations  while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments 
we believe our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the new credit agreement 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments that could affect our financial condition 
however  based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt derivative instruments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total includes an a million or million at the exchange rate on december  non interest bearing loan due in assumed in the freightlink acquisition with a carrying value of million as of december  assumes no change in variable interest rates from december  includes the fair value of our interest rate swaps of million and the fair value of our cross currency swap of million 
includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures 
includes estimated casualty obligations of million  deferred compensation of million  locomotive parts purchase obligations of million and certain other long term liabilities of million 
in addition  the table includes estimated post retirement medical and life insurance benefits of million and our estimated contributions of million to our pension plans 
table excludes any reserves for income taxes under us gaap because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our unrecognized tax benefits beyond as of december   our reserves for income taxes totaled approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation  agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we have made guarantees  have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets  or a similar arrangement  that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  have an obligation under certain derivative instruments  or have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us 
our off balance sheet arrangements as of december  consisted of operating lease obligations  which are included in the contractual obligations table above 
impact of foreign currencies on operating revenues and expenses when comparing the effects on revenues of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended december  versus the year ended december   foreign currency translation had an overall negative impact on our consolidated revenues due to the weakening of the canadian dollar and the euro relative to the united states dollar  partially offset by the strengthening of the australian dollar relative to the united states dollar in the year ended december  since the world s major crude oil and refined products are traded in united states dollars  we believe there was little  if any  impact of foreign currency translation on our fuel sales to third parties in australia 
currency effects related to operating revenues and expenses are presented within the discussion of these respective items included within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations  reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets  as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
business combinations we account for businesses we acquire using the acquisition method of accounting 
under this method  all acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred 
we record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition date fair values 
as part of this process  we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and asset lives  and therefore require considerable judgment 
these determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods 
the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost 
we capitalize major renewals or improvements  but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
we incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose 
major renewals or improvements  however  are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset  or both 
when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense  we evaluate the substance of the respective spending 
for example  costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge  either through individual projects or pre established multi year programs  which substantially upgrade the bridge s capacity to carry increased loads and or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge  are capitalized 
however  costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components  such as plates or bolts  are expensed as incurred 
other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred  we do not apply pre defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense 
unlike the class i railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks  our short line and regional railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances 
as a result  we typically incur minimal spending on self constructed assets and  instead  the vast majority of our capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors 
we also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses 
however  if and when such costs are incurred  they are expensed 
the following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands gross capitalized major renewals and improvements grants from outside parties net capitalized major renewals and improvements total repairs and maintenance expense we depreciate our property and equipment on the straight line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment 
the following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment estimated useful life in years property minimum maximum buildings and leasehold improvements subject to term of lease bridges tunnels culverts track property equipment computer equipment locomotives and rail cars vehicles and mobile equipment signals and crossing equipment track equipment other equipment we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that our long lived tangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred 
if we identify impairment of an asset  we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset  as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances 
losses from impairment of assets are charged to net gain loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses 
gains or losses on sales  including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects  or losses incurred through other dispositions  such as unanticipated retirement or destruction  are credited or charged to net loss gain on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses 
gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment 
if the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value  we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value 
there were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended december   and grants from outside parties grants from outside parties are recorded as long term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at least annually to assess impairment  since these assets are not amortized 
we perform our annual impairment test as of november of each year  and no impairment was recognized for the years ended december   and  as a result of our annual impairment test 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for goodwill  a two step impairment model is used 
we first compare the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment  which primarily incorporates certain factors including our assumptions about operating results  business plans  income projections  anticipated future cash flows and market data 
second  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be considered impaired 
the second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
amortizable intangible assets we perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present 
we have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements  customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements 
these intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served  the customer relationship  or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals 
derailment and property damages  personal injuries and third party claims we maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail related services 
railamerica liability and property insurance coverage will remain in place until our annual insurance renewal later in  following which it is expected that all of our operations will be under one insurance program 
our primary liability policies currently have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence 
railamerica primary liability policies currently have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence as of december   and prior self insured retentions have been as high as million per occurrence 
with respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities  our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials  including expenses related to evacuation  as a result of a railroad accident 
personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies 
accruals for fela claims by our railroad employees and third party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable 
these estimates are updated in future periods as information develops 
our property damage policies currently have various self insured retentions  which vary based on type and location of the incident  of up to million 
railamerica primary property damage policies currently have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence 
the property damage policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events 
the self insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history  the size and make up of our company and general insurance market conditions 
stock based compensation the compensation committee of our board of directors compensation committee has discretion to determine grantees  grant dates  amounts of grants  vesting and expiration dates for grants to our employees under our second amended and restated omnibus incentive plan the omnibus plan 
the omnibus plan permits the issuance of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the compensation committee  in each case consistent with the omnibus plan s purpose 
under the terms of the awards  equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors 
the grant date fair value of non vested shares  less estimated forfeitures  is recorded to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model and straight line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant 
two assumptions in the black scholes pricing model require management judgment the life of the option and the volatility of the stock over the life of the option 
the assumption for the life of the option is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant 
the assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on historical and implied volatility 
the fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant 
for the year ended december   compensation cost from equity awards was million 
we also recorded an additional million of costs from the acceleration of equity awards for certain terminated employees related to the integration of railamerica 
as of december   the compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized was million  which will be recognized over the next three years with a weighted average period of years 
the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards  including the benefit recognized from the acceleration of equity awards related to the integration of railamerica  was million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   compensation cost from equity awards was million 
the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards was million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   compensation cost from equity awards was million 
the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards was million for the year ended december  income taxes we account for income taxes under a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as available income tax credits and capital and net operating loss carryforwards 
in our consolidated balance sheets  these deferred obligations or benefits are classified as current or non current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting 
a deferred income tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred income tax assets related to tax credit and loss carryforwards  is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether  based on all available evidence  our deferred income tax assets will be realizable 
valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
no provision is made for the united states income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries 
if the earnings were to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to united states income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
the amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of december  was million 
other uncertainties our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in our forward looking statements 
for a complete description of our general risk factors including risk factors of foreign operations  see part item a 
risk factors in this annual report 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances to which we may be currently subject  and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 
recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we actively monitor our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks 
we use derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures 
we do not trade or use such instruments with the objective of earning financial gains from interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations  nor do we use such instruments where there are no underlying cash exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
we manage our hedging positions and monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and do not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
management believes that our use of derivative financial instruments to manage risk is in our best interest 
however  our use of derivative financial instruments may result in short term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility 
interest rate risk risk sensitivity our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations  where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the following table presents principal cash flows from our debt obligations  related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt tangible equity units other debt average annual interest rate variable rate debt revolving credit facility australia europe united states term loans australia canada united states average annual interest rate total includes a million or million at the exchange rate on december  non interest bearing loan due in assumed in the freightlink acquisition with a carrying value of million as of december  with an effective interest rate of 
the variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using united states libor  australia bbsw  canadian libor and euro libor as of december  
the borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of for united states  australian  canadian and european borrowings under our new credit agreement 
to the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements  based on the table above  assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates  annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately million 
furthermore  if we were to refinance all of our debt obligations in the current environment  we believe we would incur interest rates no worse  and potentially better  than our current rates 
fair value of financial instruments we apply the following three level hierarchy of valuation inputs as a framework for measuring fair value level quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable 
since our long term debt is not quoted  fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on level valuation inputs  including borrowing rates we believe are currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities 
primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value of our debt to fluctuate period to period include the fixed interest rates  the future interest rates  credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the debt obligations 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates of our variable rate debt 
these agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
to value the interest rate swaps  a discounted cash flow model is utilized 
primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value to fluctuate period to period include the fixed interest rates  libor implied forward interest rates  credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the interest rate swaps 
management s intention is to hold the interest rate swaps to maturity 
changes in the fair value of the agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income loss  based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments attributable to our variable rate debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rates on a portion of our outstanding borrowings 
the swap has a notional amount of million and requires us to pay a fixed rate of on the notional amount 
in return  we receive one month libor on the notional amount of the swap  which is equivalent to our variable rate obligation on the notional amounts under the new credit agreement 
this swap expires on september  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into multiple interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
the following table summarizes the terms of the interest rate swap agreements dollars in thousands notional amount effective date expiration date date amount pay fixed rate receive variable rate month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor month libor on november   we entered into multiple year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
on the date of the hedge designation  september   it is probable that we will either issue million of fixed rate debt or have million of variable rate debt under our commercial banking lines 
the forward starting interest swap agreements are expected to settle in cash on september  we expect any gains or losses on settlement will be amortized over the life of the respective swaps 
the swaps have a notional amount of million and require us to pay a fixed rate of and receive three month libor on the notional amount over a year period expiring september  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on level inputs 
our effectiveness testing during the year ended december   resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into earnings  as more fully described in note  accumulated other comprehensive income to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as of december   million of third party debt related to our foreign operations was denominated in the currencies in which our subsidiaries operate  including the australian dollar  canadian dollar and euro 
the debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations 
as a result  foreign currency risk related to our debt service payments is limited 
however  in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid from our foreign operations  we may face exchange rate risk if the australian or canadian dollar or euro were to appreciate relative to the united states dollar and require higher united states dollar equivalent cash 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations  including non functional currency intercompany debt  typically from our united states operations to our foreign subsidiaries  and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business to the extent such acquisition is funded with united states dollars 
to mitigate currency exposures related to non functional currency denominated intercompany debt  cross currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt 
in determining the fair value of the derivative contract  the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets 
to mitigate currency exposures of non united states dollar denominated acquisitions  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts 
although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus reducing the associated risk 
the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income expense  net 
on december   we completed the freightlink acquisition for a million or million at the exchange rate on december  
we financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement then in effect 
on november   we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts  with funds to be delivered on december   to secure an exchange rate for a million of the a million purchase of the freightlink assets 
the subsequent decrease in the value of australian dollar versus the united states dollar between november  and december  and its impact on the a million of purchase price resulted in an additional expense of million within other expense income  net 
in addition  a portion of the funds were transferred from the united states to australia through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of a million or million at the exchange rate on december  
to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this non functional currency intercompany loan  we entered into an australian dollar united states dollar floating to floating cross currency swap agreement the swap  effective as of december   which effectively converted the a million intercompany loan receivable in the united states into a million loan receivable 
the swap required us to pay australian dollar bbsw plus based on a notional amount of a million and allowed us to receive united states libor plus based on a notional amount of million on a quarterly basis 
bbsw is the wholesale interbank reference rate within australia  which we believe is generally considered the australian equivalent to libor 
as a result of these quarterly net settlement payments  we realized a net expense of million within interest expense income for the year ended december  in addition  we recognized a net gain of million within other income expense related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended december  the swap expired on december  and was settled for million 
on november   simultaneous with the termination of the existing swap  we entered into two new year australian dollar united states dollar floating to floating cross currency swap agreements the swaps  effective december  and expires on december  the swaps effectively convert the a million intercompany loan receivable in the united states into a million loan receivable 
the swaps require us to pay australian dollar bbsw plus based on a notional amount of a million and allow us to receive united states libor plus based on a notional amount of million on a quarterly basis 
as a result of these quarterly net settlement payments  we realized a net expense of million within interest expense income for the year ended december  in addition  we recognized a net loss of million within other income expense related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended december  the following table summarizes the impact of these foreign currency financial instruments on our statement of operations for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands amount recognized in earnings location of amount recognized in earnings quarterly settlement under cross currency swap interest expense income mark to market of intercompany debt other income expense  net mark to market of cross currency swap other expense income  net the following table presents our financial instruments that are carried at fair value using level inputs at december  and dollars in thousands financial liabilities carried at fair value using level inputs interest rate swap agreements cross currency swap agreements total financial assets carried at fair value interest rate swap agreements cross currency swap agreements total financial liabilities carried at fair value contingent forward sale contract in conjunction with our announcement on july  of our plan to acquire railamerica  we entered into the investment agreement with carlyle in order to partially fund the acquisition of railamerica 
pursuant to the investment agreement  we agreed to sell to carlyle a minimum of million of series a preferred stock 
each share of the series a preferred stock was convertible at any time  at the option of the holder  into approximately shares of class a common stock  subject to customary conversion adjustments 
the series a preferred stock was also convertible into the relevant number of shares of class a common stock on the second anniversary of the date of issuance  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
furthermore  we had the option to convert some or all of the series a preferred stock prior to the second anniversary of the date of issue of the series a preferred stock if the closing price of our class a common stock on the new york stock exchange exceeded of the conversion price or for consecutive trading days  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the conversion price of the series a preferred stock was set at approximately  which was a premium in our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the railamerica acquisition 
for the period between july  and september   the series a preferred stock was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark to market non cash income or expense included in our consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability 
as a result of the significant increase in our share price between july  and the end of the third quarter of  we recorded a million non cash mark to market expense to the investment agreement for the twelve months ended december  the closing price of our class a common stock was on september   which was the last trading day prior to issuing the series a preferred stock 
as the closing price of our class a common stock exceeded for consecutive trading days as of february   we converted the million of series a preferred stock into  shares of our class a common stock on february  these shares were included in our weighted average diluted common shares outstanding in calculating eps for on the conversion date  we paid to carlyle cash in lieu of fractional shares and all accrued and unpaid dividends in respect of the series a preferred stock in an amount equal to million 
following the conversion  we will not incur the quarterly dividend of approximately million that would otherwise have been due on the series a preferred stock 
see note  subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further information relating to the conversion of the series a preferred stock into our class a common stock 
sensitivity to diesel fuel prices we are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows 
in the year ended december   fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented of our total expenses 
as of december   we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk 
we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that offset the impact of higher fuel prices 
as of december   each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a million increase in our annual fuel expense to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and or rates
