table of contents part i item business general overview we are a growth oriented delaware master limited partnership organized in to own  operate  acquire and develop midstream energy assets 
our common units are publicly traded and listed on the nyse under the symbol cmlp 
crestwood gas services gp llc  our general partner general partner is owned by crestwood holdings partners  llc and its affiliates crestwood holdings 
we are managed by our general partner and conduct substantially all of our business through cmlp 
first reserve management  lp first reserve  a private equity firm with substantial investments in the energy industry  owns a significant equity interest in crestwood holdings 
we own and operate predominately fee based gathering  processing  treating and compression assets servicing natural gas producers in the barnett shale in north texas  the fayetteville shale in northwestern arkansas  the granite wash in the texas panhandle  the marcellus shale in northern west virginia  the avalon shale bone spring in southeastern new mexico  and the haynesville bossier shale in western louisiana 
we provide midstream services to various producers that focus on developing unconventional resources across the united states 
approximately of our gross margin  which we define as total revenue less product purchases  is derived from fee based service contracts  which minimizes our commodity price exposure and provides us with less volatile operating performance and cash flows 
organizational structure as of december   our ownership is as follows crestwood holdings public total general partner interest limited partner interests common unitholders class c unitholders total business strategy our business strategy is to capitalize on our competitive strengths to increase our revenue  profitability and cash flow by pursuing growth through midstream acquisitions and greenfield development projects 
we are a growth oriented master limited partnership focused on acquiring and developing natural gas gathering  processing  treating  compression  transportation  ngl and crude oil assets in and around shale plays 
we believe that our experience and market position will allow us to realize significant ongoing growth opportunities by developing new greenfield projects in ngl and oil plays in areas with limited or constrained infrastructure which offer attractive returns on investment and seeking bolt on acquisitions that provide operating synergies and allow for the development of our business in rich gas infrastructure plays 
our acquisition strategy includes diversifying and extending our geographic  customer and business profile and developing organic growth opportunities along the midstream value chain 
this strategy was illustrated by our consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries acquiring approximately million and million of midstream assets and businesses in and increasing utilization of existing assets and expanding our pipeline system capacities to meet our customers needs and to attract new customers 
we believe that the location of our existing assets and relationships with active producers position us well to capture the growing need for midstream services 
we aim 
table of contents to attract increased gathering  processing and treating volumes by marketing our midstream services  expanding our gathering systems and providing superior customer service to natural gas producers 
we will compete for new customers based on available capacity in our systems  competitive fees for service and our willingness to construct or expand facilities 
maintaining a disciplined financial policy and financing flexibility 
we have significantly grown our midstream business while maintaining a disciplined financial policy 
we believe in operating with a reasonable amount of leverage as we have to date  and we expect to continue this strategy by balancing the amount of leverage with our growth objectives  cash flow and equity 
our growth strategy is also based upon our ability to access various sources of capital 
we have supportive relationships with a diverse group of banks  which have committed an aggregate of million under our amended and restated senior secured credit facility  dated november   which matures on november  credit facility 
we believe the available borrowing capacity under our credit facility  combined with cash flow from operations and our proven ability to access the capital markets will enable us to achieve our growth strategy 
business strengths we believe that we are well positioned to successfully execute our primary business strategies due to the following competitive strengths our assets are located in attractive shale plays 
our assets are located in shale plays which are marked by favorable characteristics such as proven production  substantial gas in place  improving development and operating costs and existing intrastate and interstate pipeline infrastructure 
we believe that our established positions in these areas give us an opportunity to expand our gathering system footprint and increase our throughput volumes and plant utilization  ultimately increasing cash flows 
a history of improving well performance and lower operating and development costs associated with our areas of operation generally enable producers to achieve attractive returns on investment through various gas price environments 
in addition  certain of our assets gather and process natural gas in rich gas shale plays which typically contain ngls 
the ngls create additional value and improved drilling economics for our producers 
we operate five systems located in basis that include ngl rich gas shale plays  i the cowtown system  ii the granite wash system  iii the las animas systems  and iv the two systems acquired by crestwood marcellus midstream llc cmm  our unconsolidated affiliate in the marcellus segment 
for the year ended december   our consolidated systems ie  excluding cmm located in ngl rich gas basins contributed approximately of our total revenues and of our total gathering volumes 
for the year ended december   our consolidated and unconsolidated systems that we operate located in ngl rich gas basins ie  including of cmm s results  when combined  would have contributed approximately of our total consolidated and unconsolidated revenues and of total consolidated and unconsolidated gathering volumes 
additionally  existing intrastate and interstate pipelines interconnect with our midstream assets to provide our customers with access to growing and diverse natural gas markets  located in the northeast  midwest and southeastern united states 
these factors support continued producer drilling and development activity in the basins or shale plays in which we operate 
our customer contracts are typically long term and fixed fee 
our primarily fixed fee and long term contract structure largely eliminates our exposure to direct commodity price risk and provides us with long term cash flow stability 
more than of our gross margin is derived from fixed fee service contracts 
the initial terms of a substantial number of our contracts extend through in addition  current and planned production from acreage dedications from antero resources appalachian corporation antero  quicksilver resources inc quicksilver  devon energy corporation devon  bhp billiton petroleum bhp  british petroleum  plc 
bp  xto energy  a subsidiary of exxon mobil corporation xto energy and chesapeake energy corporation chesapeake should provide future growth

substantially all of our assets have been constructed since  which enables us to provide efficient and reliable service to our producers 
our relatively new asset base in relation to our competitors benefits from both low operating costs and minimal maintenance capital requirements 
the integrated nature of our operations by which we provide gathering  processing  treating  compression  transportation and sales services  positions us well to serve our customers 
our system infrastructure and capacities have been designed to accommodate long term basin development plans 
we have an experienced  knowledgeable management team with a proven record of performance 
our senior management team has substantial experience in the oil and gas industry with a proven record of enhancing value through the acquisition  integration  development and operation of midstream companies and publicly traded entities 
we believe that this team provides us with a strong foundation for developing additional natural gas gathering and processing assets and pursuing strategic acquisition opportunities 
we have assembled an experienced business development team to lead our effort to develop greenfield opportunities 
our business development team is charged with pursuing opportunities in some of the more attractive unconventional oil and rich gas plays in north america 
we expect that the majority of the initial funding for these development projects will take place at a private holding company controlled by our general partner with funds sourced from private equity and debt placements 
as these projects mature and begin generating sufficient cash flows  it is contemplated that these projects will be sold or dropped down into us through arms length transactions providing us with a steady source of incremental cash flow 
we have strong sponsor support 
first reserve owns a significant equity interest in crestwood holdings  and as a result  has significant control over our operations 
first reserve has shown a strong commitment to our success to date  and we believe that they will continue to support our ongoing development 
for example  during the first quarter of  we formed our cmm joint venture with crestwood holdings  which is further discussed below 
the assets which we operate in the marcellus systems are owned by our joint venture 
we believe that first reserve is one of the most respected and seasoned private equity investors focusing on the energy sector 
acquisitions we completed the following acquisitions during and to date cmlp acquisitions cmm acquisition 
during the first quarter of  we and crestwood holdings formed the cmm joint venture 
we contributed approximately million for a membership interest and crestwood holdings contributed approximately million for a membership interest

table of contents cmm s marcellus shale acquisitions antero 
during the first quarter of  we and crestwood holdings  through the cmm joint venture  acquired certain of antero s gathering system assets located harrison and doddridge counties  west virginia 
cmm s purchase price to acquire the assets was approximately million 
antero may earn additional payments of up to million based upon average annual production levels achieved during  and additionally  cmm entered into a year fixed fee  gas gathering and compression agreement gga with antero  which provided for an area of dedication at the time of acquisition of approximately  gross acres  or  net acres  largely located in the rich gas corridor of the southwestern core of the marcellus shale play 
we operate cmm and all costs associated with its operation and the antero assets will be reimbursed to us by cmm 
concurrent with the formation of cmm  we and crestwood holdings  arranged for a million revolving credit facility that cmm can utilize for asset acquisitions and capital expenditures relating to the installation of gathering systems and compressor stations in the area of dedication as required by the gga 
the area of dedication is largely located within the rich gas window of the southwestern core marcellus shale play in northern west virginia 
the antero assets acquired consist of a mile low pressure gathering system which gathered approximately mmcf d of natural gas produced from existing antero horizontal marcellus shale wells located within the area of dedication 
the gathering pipelines deliver antero s marcellus shale production to various regional pipeline systems including columbia  dominion  equitrans and mark west energy partners sherwood gas processing plant 
the gga provides cmm with a right of first offer  for seven years from closing  to acquire any future antero midstream assets sold by antero in an area of approximately  acres adjacent to the area of dedication that includes prospective rich gas acreage

competition the midstream energy industry is highly competitive 
competition is based on  among other things  the following reputation  efficiency  flexibility  size  
table of contents credit quality and reliability of the gatherer  the pricing arrangements offered by the gatherer  location of the gatherer s pipeline facilities  and the gatherer s ability to offer a full range of services including natural gas gathering  processing  treating  compression  transportation and sales 
we believe that offering an integrated package of services allows us to compete more effectively for new natural gas supplies in our operating areas 
we face strong competition in acquiring new natural gas supplies and in pursuing acquisition opportunities as part of our long term growth strategy 
our competitors include entities that gather  process and market natural gas 
our competitors may have capital resources and control supplies of natural gas greater than ours 
competition is typically impacted by the level of drilling activity in a particular geographic region  as well as fluctuations in commodity prices for oil  natural gas and ngls 
our primary competitors in the midstream industry consist of energy transfer  crosstex  eagle rock energy partners  lp  enterprise product partners and certain producer owned gathering systems 
we believe that we are able to compete with these companies based on gathering and processing efficiencies  operating costs and commercial terms offered to producers  along with the location and available capacity of our gathering systems and processing plants 
customers and concentration of credit risk quicksilver s production volumes accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and we also gather certain natural gas volumes that quicksilver purchases from eni spa  which comprised  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and bhp  our largest customer in our fayetteville segment  accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  and approximately of our total revenues for the period from acquisition april  to december  although quicksilver and bhp continue to develop their resources in counties in and around the barnett and fayetteville shales  respectively  reductions in their future drilling programs could result in reduced volumes gathered  treated and processed in our facilities  if not replaced by other producers in the affected system or other system 
in addition  a default in payments by quicksilver or bhp to us for our services could have a material impact on our cash flows 
regulatory environment governmental regulation regulation of our business may affect certain aspects of our operations and the market for our products and services 
state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory requirements  complaint based rate regulation or general utility regulation 
in texas  we have filed with the texas railroad commission trcc to establish rates and terms of service for certain of our pipelines 
in texas  our assets include intrastate common carrier ngl pipelines subject to the regulation of the trcc  which requires that our ngl pipelines file tariff publications that contain all the rules and regulations governing the rates and charges for services we perform 
ngl pipeline rates may be limited to provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services 

table of contents gathering pipeline regulation section b of the natural gas act  or nga  exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
our natural gas gathering activity is not subject to internet posting requirements imposed by the ferc as a result of the ferc s market transparency initiatives 
we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is  therefore  not subject to the ferc jurisdiction 
the distinction between ferc regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services  however  is the subject of substantial  on going litigation  so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc  the courts or congress 
state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint based rate regulation 
in recent years  the ferc has taken a more light handed approach to regulation of the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies  which has resulted in a number of such companies transferring gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates 
as a result of these activities  natural gas gathering may begin to receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels 
our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 
our natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of gathering facilities 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  such changes might have on our operations  but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 
our natural gas gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes 
these statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer 
these statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply 
the regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas 
the states in which we currently operate have adopted complaint based regulation of natural gas gathering activities  which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination 
we cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future 
failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal remedies 
to date  there has been no adverse effect to our systems due to these regulations 
safety and maintenance regulation the pipelines we use to gather and transport natural gas and ngls are subject to regulation by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa of the department of transportation dot  pursuant to the natural gas pipeline safety act of  as amended ngpsa with respect to natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety act of  as amended  or the hlpsa with respect to ngls 
both the ngpsa and the hlpsa have been amended by the pipeline safety improvement act of psia which was reauthorized and amended most recently by the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty  and job creation act of the ngpsa regulates safety requirements in the design  construction  operation and maintenance of natural gas and ngl pipeline facilities  while the psia establishes mandatory inspections for all us liquid and gas transportation pipelines and some gathering lines in high population areas 
the phmsa has developed regulations implementing the psia that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs  including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas  such as high population areas  areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways 
we  or the entities in which we own an interest  inspect our pipelines regularly in compliance with state and federal maintenance requirements 

table of contents states are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the dot to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines 
in practice  because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines  states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety 
we do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations 
our pipelines have operations and maintenance plans designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety requirements 
in addition  we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations  including the occupational safety and health administration osha and comparable state statutes  the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers  both generally and within the pipeline industry 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard  the environmental protection agency s epa community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we and the entities in which we own an interest are also subject to osha process safety management regulations  as well as the epa s risk management program rmp which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic  reactive  flammable or explosive chemicals 
these regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds or any process which involves flammable liquid or gas in excess of  pounds 
we have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements 
we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
environmental matters general our operation of pipelines  plants and other facilities to provide midstream services is subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
as an owner or operator of these facilities  we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal  state and local levels 
these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways  such as the following requiring the acquisition of various permits to conduct regulated activities  requiring the installation of pollution control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we can handle or dispose of our wastes  limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas  such as wetlands  coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species  requiring investigative and remedial actions to mitigate or eliminate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations  and enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non compliance with such environmental laws and regulations and permits issued pursuant thereto 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements 
certain environmental statutes impose strict  and in some cases  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released  thus  we may be subject to environmental liability at our currently owned or operated facilities for conditions caused prior to our involvement 

table of contents the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate 
we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 
we also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations 
we do not believe that compliance with current federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  we believe that the various environmental activities in which we are presently engaged are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather  process  compress  treat and transport natural gas and ngls 
we can make no assurances  however  that future events  such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies  the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs 
below is a discussion of several of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
hazardous substances and waste our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances  solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons 
these laws generally regulate the generation  storage  treatment  transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict  and in some cases  joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed 
for instance  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla or superfund law and comparable state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons referred to as potentially responsible parties prps 
these prps include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred  prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release  and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  prps may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the prps 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
despite the petroleum exclusion of cercla section  which currently encompasses natural gas  we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of cercla  or similar state statutes  in the course of our ordinary operations and  as a result  may be jointly and severally liable under cercla  or similar state statutes  for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment 
we also generate solid wastes  including hazardous wastes  which are subject to the requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
while rcra regulates both solid and hazardous wastes  it imposes strict requirements on the generation  storage  treatment  transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes 
certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from rcra s hazardous waste regulations 
however  it is possible that these wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during our operations  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and  therefore  be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements 
any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

table of contents we own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled 
we have generally utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  although hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us  or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal 
in addition  certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination 
we are not currently aware of any facts  events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
air emissions our operations are subject to the federal clean air act caa  and comparable state laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources  including our compressor stations  and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements 
such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities  obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions 
our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties  injunctions  conditions or restrictions on operations and  potentially  criminal enforcement actions 
we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements 
we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining permits and approvals for air emissions 
we believe  however  that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements  and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated companies 
climate change in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other greenhouse gases ghg present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such naturally occurring gases are contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climate changes  the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that would require a reduction in emissions of ghg from motor vehicles and also may trigger construction and operating permit review for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
the epa has published its final rule to address the permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permitting programs  pursuant to which these permitting programs have been tailored to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
it is widely expected that facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to reduce those emissions according to best available control technology standards for ghg that have yet to be developed 
these epa rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities 
with regard to the monitoring and reporting of ghg  on november   the epa published a final rule expanding its existing ghg emissions reporting rule published in october to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas processing  transmission  storage  and distribution activities  which includes certain of our operations 
in addition  the rule requires the reporting of ghg emissions for covered facilities on an annual basis beginning in for ghg emissions occurring in as of december   we were in compliance with the epa rule 
water discharges the federal water pollution control act clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants or dredged and fill material into state waters as well as waters of the us and adjacent wetlands 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except 
table of contents in accordance with the terms of permits issued by the epa  the army corps of engineers or an analogous state agency 
spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill  rupture or leak 
in addition  the clean water act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities 
these permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities 
some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 
we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements 
however  federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
we believe that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
endangered species the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats 
while some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species  we believe that we are in material compliance with the esa 
however  the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states 
anti terrorism measures the department of homeland security appropriation act of requires the department of homeland security dhs to issue regulations establishing risk based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities  including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present high levels of security risk 
the dhs issued an interim final rule in april regarding risk based performance standards to be attained pursuant to this act and  on establish chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance 
we have determined the extent to which our facilities are subject to the rule  made the necessary notifications and determined that the requirements will not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors together  with all of the other information included in this report  when deciding whether to invest in us 
limited partner interests are inherently different from capital stock of a corporation  although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business 
you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in such event  we may not be able to make distributions to our unitholders and the trading price of our common units could decline 
risks related to our business we are dependent on a limited number of natural gas producers  including quicksilver  for the natural gas we gather  process  treat  compress  transport and sell 
a material reduction in production by these customers would result in a material decline in our revenue and cash available for distribution 
we rely on a limited number of customers for our revenue 
our top five customers comprised approximately of our total consolidated revenues in although many of our contracts extend to and beyond  we may be unable to negotiate on favorable terms  if at all  any extension or replacement of our contracts with such customers after the term of their respective contracts expire 
our largest customer is quicksilver 
quicksilver s production volumes accounted for of our total revenues in we also gather certain natural gas volumes that quicksilver purchases from eni spa  which comprised approximately of our total revenues in we expect quicksilver to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in quicksilver has no contractual obligation to develop its properties in the areas covered by their dedication to us and it may determine that it is strategically more attractive to direct its capital spending and resources to other areas 
a decrease in quicksilver s capital spending and reserves in the areas covered by their dedication to us could result in reduced natural gas gathered and processed by us and a material decline in our revenue and cash flow 
furthermore  the credit ratings of quicksilver are below investment grade 
accordingly  the risk of loss resulting from any material non payment or non performance by quicksilver is higher than it would be with a more creditworthy customer  especially in light of the significant concentration of business conducted with quicksilver 
unless and until we significantly diversify our customer base  we expect to remain subject to non diversified risk of non payment or late payment of our fees 
in addition  quicksilver is highly leveraged and subject to its own operating and regulatory risks  which could increase the risk that it may default on its obligations to us 
we may not have sufficient available cash to enable us to make cash distributions to holders of our common units at the current distribution rate under our cash distribution policy 
in order to pay cash distributions of per unit per quarter based on the distribution declared in january  or per unit per year  we must generate available cash of approximately million per quarter  or million per year based on the number of general partner units and common units outstanding on 
table of contents december  we may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable us to pay the announced distributions 
the amount of cash we can distribute depends principally upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the fees we charge and the margins we realize for our services  the level of production  and the prices of  natural gas  ngls  and condensate  the volume of natural gas and ngls we gather and process  the level of competition from other midstream energy companies  the level of our operating and maintenance and general and administrative costs  prevailing economic conditions  the level of capital expenditures we make  our ability to make borrowings under our credit facility  the cost of acquisitions  our debt service requirements  fluctuations in our working capital needs  our ability to access capital markets  compliance with our debt agreements  and the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner 
the amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our common units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability 
accordingly we may be prevented from making distributions  even during periods in which we record net income 
the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow and not solely on profitability  which may be affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we report net losses  and conversely  we might fail to make cash distributions during periods when we report net profits 
estimates of oil and gas reserves depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
therefore  future volumes of natural gas on our systems could be less than we anticipate and could adversely affect our financial performance 
we typically do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems 
accordingly  we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves 
if the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to our systems is less than we anticipate and we are unable to secure additional sources of natural gas  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because of the natural decline in production from existing wells in our areas of operations  our success depends on our ability to obtain new sources of natural gas which is dependent on factors beyond our control 
any decrease in available supplies of natural gas could result in a material decline in the volumes we gather  process  treat and compress 
our gathering systems are connected to wells whose production will naturally decline over time  which means that our cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time 
to maintain or increase throughput levels on our system  we must continually obtain new natural gas supplies 
our ability to obtain additional sources of natural gas depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near our pipeline systems by our customers and our ability to compete for volumes against other midstream service providers 

table of contents while we have dedications from our customers which include certain producing and non producing oil and gas properties  we have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operations  the amount of reserves associated with the wells drilled  rate at which wells are produced or the rate at which production from a well will decline 
in addition  we have no control over producers drilling or production decisions  which are affected by  among other things  prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulations  availability of drilling rigs and other production and development services and the availability and cost of capital 
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect investments to develop natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as natural gas prices decrease 
declines in natural gas prices could have a negative impact on exploration  development and production activity and  if sustained  could lead to a material decrease in such activity 
reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operations could lead to reduced utilization of our systems 
because of these factors  even if natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets  producers may choose not to develop those reserves 
moreover  our customers are not contractually obligated to develop the reserves and or properties they have dedicated to us 
if reductions in drilling activity or increased competition result in our inability to obtain new sources of supply to replace the natural decline of volumes from existing wells  throughput on our systems would decline  which could reduce our revenue  cash flow and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
in addition  various federal and state initiatives are underway to regulate  or further investigate  the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing  a practice that involves the pressurized injection of water  chemicals and other substances into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production 
hydraulic fracturing has also generated publicity regarding its potential environmental impact 
the adoption of any future federal  state or local laws or regulations imposing additional permitting  disclosure or regulatory obligations related to  or otherwise restricting or increasing costs regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult to drill certain oil and natural gas wells 
as a result  the volume of natural gas or associated ngls that we gather and process from wells that use hydraulic fracturing could be substantially reduced  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distributions to our unitholders 
our construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and is subject to regulatory  environmental  safety  political  legal and economic risks  which could adversely affect our cash flow  results of operations and financial condition 
one of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new midstream assets 
additions or modifications to our asset base involve numerous regulatory  environmental  safety  political and legal uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital 
if we undertake these projects  they may not be completed on schedule  at the budgeted cost  or at all 
moreover  our revenue may not increase as anticipated for a particular project 
for instance  we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize 
since we are not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas reserves  we may not have access to third party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing or acquiring facilities in such area 
to the extent we rely on estimates of future production by parties in our decision to expand our systems  such estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production 
as a result  new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  expansion of our asset base generally requires us to obtain new rights of way 
we may be unable to obtain such rights of way or it may become more expensive for us to obtain or renew rights of way 
if the cost of rights of way increases  our cash flow could be adversely affected 
if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  our future growth will be limited 
in addition to expanding our existing systems  one of our primary strategies is to pursue acquisitions 
if we are unable to make these acquisitions because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates  to analyze acquisition opportunities successfully from an operational and financial point of view or to negotiate 
table of contents acceptable purchase contracts with them  unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or outbid by competitors  then our future growth could be limited 
furthermore  even if we do make acquisitions  these acquisitions may not result in an increase in the cash generated by operations 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including  among other things incorrect assumptions about volumes  revenues and costs  including synergies  an inability to successfully integrate the assets we acquire  the assumption of unknown liabilities  limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller  incorrect assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt  the diversion of management s and employees attention from other business matters  unforeseen difficulties of operating in new product areas  with new customers  or new geographic areas  customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses  an inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities  operating a larger combined organization and adding operations  maintaining an effective system of internal controls related to the acquired business and integrating internal controls  compliance under the sarbanes oxley act of and other regulatory compliance and corporate governance matters  and potential environmental or regulatory compliance matters or liabilities and title issues  including certain liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired business before the acquisition any of the above risks could significantly impair our ability to manage our business and materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our midstream assets to generate our revenues  and if the utilization of these assets was reduced significantly  there could be a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
operations of our midstream assets could be partially curtailed or completely shut down  temporarily or permanently  as a result of operational problems  labor difficulties or environmental proceedings or other litigation  catastrophic events at our facilities or at downstream facilities owned by others  lack of transportation or fractionation capacity  an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of natural gas  or prolonged reductions in exploration or production activity by producers in the areas in which we operate 
the magnitude of the effect on us of any curtailment of our operations will depend on the length of the curtailment and the extent of the operations affected by such curtailment 
we have no control over many of the factors that may lead to a curtailment of operations 
in the event that we are unable to provide gathering  processing  treating  compression  transportation or sales services for consecutive days our producers may have the right to deliver their gas to alternative pipelines 
if such a termination were to occur  it could cause our revenues  earnings and cash flow to decrease 

table of contents we cannot control the operations of third party ngl fractionation and natural gas and ngl transportation facilities  and our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash available for distribution could be adversely affected 
we depend upon third party ngl transportation and fractionation systems that we do not own 
since we do not own or operate these assets  their continuing operation is not within our control 
if any of these third party pipelines and other facilities becomes unavailable or capacity constrained  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
if one of our gas gathering agreements were to be terminated by a customer as a result of our failure to perform certain obligations under the agreement  and we were unable to secure comparable alternative arrangements  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders would be adversely affected 
our gas gathering agreements are terminable if we fail to perform any of our material obligations and fail to correct such non performance within specified periods 
to the extent a customer terminates a gas gathering agreement or there is a reduction in our minimum volume commitments  our business  results of operation  financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected 
a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal  state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets  which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 
our operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction and regulation of the ferc  except that we are subject to the anti market manipulation provisions in the natural gas act  as amended by the energy policy act of  and to the ferc s regulations thereunder  including the ferc s authority to impose fines of up to million per day per violation 
notwithstanding  ferc regulation still affects these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses 
the ferc s policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities  including  for example  its policies on open access transportation  ratemaking  capacity release and market center promotion  indirectly affect intrastate markets 
in recent years  the ferc has pursued pro competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines 
however  we have no assurance that the ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to oil and natural gas transportation capacity 
in addition  the distinction between ferc regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has regularly been the subject of substantial  on going litigation 
consequently  the classification and regulation of some of our pipelines could change based on future determinations by the ferc  the courts or congress 
if our gas gathering operations become subject to ferc jurisdiction  the result may adversely affect the rates we are able to charge and the services we currently provide  and may include the potential for a termination of the gathering and processing agreements with our customers 
state and municipal regulations also affect our business 
common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to gather or provide services without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer  as a result  these statutes restrict our right to decide whose production we gather 
federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states 
the states in which we currently operate have adopted complaint based regulation of gathering activities  which allows oil and natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve access and rate grievances 
other state and municipal regulations may not directly regulate our business  but may nonetheless affect the availability of natural gas for purchase  processing and sale  including state regulation of production rates and maximum daily production allowable from gas wells 
while our gathering lines currently are subject to limited state regulation  there is a risk that state laws will be changed  which may give producers a stronger basis to challenge the rates  terms and conditions of our gathering lines 

table of contents we are subject to environmental laws  regulations and permits  including greenhouse gas requirements that may expose us to significant costs  liabilities and obligations 
we are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and permits  relating to  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use  disposal  movement and remediation of natural gas  ngls  crude oil and other hazardous materials  the emission and discharge of such materials to the ground  air and water  wildlife protection  and the health and safety of our employees 
failure to comply with these environmental requirements may result in our being subject to litigation  fines or other sanctions  including the revocation of permits and suspension of operations 
we may incur significant compliance related costs and other associated expenses related to such requirements 
we could be liable for any environmental contamination at our or our predecessors currently or formerly owned or operated properties or third party waste disposal sites  regardless of whether we were at fault 
in addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs  such matters can give rise to claims from governmental authorities and other third parties for fines or penalties  natural resource damages  personal injury and property damage 
moreover  stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our operational or compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
for instance  since august  the texas commission on environmental quality has conducted a series of analyses of air emissions in the barnett shale area in response to reported concerns about high concentrations of benzene in the air near drilling sites and natural gas processing facilities  and the analysis could result in the adoption of new air emission regulatory or permitting limitations that could require us to incur increased capital or operating costs 
additionally  environmental groups have advocated increased regulation and a moratorium on the issuance of drilling permits for new natural gas wells in developed or developing shale areas 
the adoption of any laws  regulations or other legally enforceable mandates that result in more stringent air emission limitations or that restrict or prohibit the drilling of new natural gas wells for any extended period of time could increase our operating and compliance costs as well as reduce the rate of production of natural gas operators with whom the we have a business relationship  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
these laws  regulations and permits  and the enforcement and interpretation thereof  change frequently and generally have become more stringent over time 
in particular  requirements pertaining to air emissions  including volatile organic compound emissions  have been implemented or are under development that could lead us to incur significant costs or obligations or curtail our operations 
for example  ghg emission regulation has become more stringent 
we are currently required to report annual ghg emissions from some of our operations  and additional ghg emission related requirements are in various stages of development 
in addition  the epa has now begun regulating ghg emissions from stationary sources pursuant to the prevention of significant deterioration and title v provisions of the caa 
such regulations could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits  implement additional pollution control technology  curtail operations or increase significantly our operating costs in the future 
any regulation of ghg emissions  including through a cap and trade or similar emissions trading schemes  technology mandate  emissions tax  reporting requirement or other program  could adversely affect our business  reputation  operating performance and product demand 
in addition  to the extent climate change results in more severe weather  our customers operations may be disrupted  which could reduce product demand 
in addition  various federal and state initiatives are underway to regulate  or further investigate the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing  a practice that involves the pressurized injection of water  chemicals and other substances into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production 
to the extent these initiatives reduce the volume of natural gas or associated ngls that we gather and process  they could adversely affect our business 
our costs  liabilities and obligations relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may incur costs as a result of pipeline integrity management program testing 
the dot requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for pipelines located where a leak or rupture could harm high consequence areas 
the regulations require operators  including us  to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity  identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area  maintain processes for data collection  integration and analysis  repair and remediate pipelines as necessary  and implement preventive and mitigating actions 
we currently estimate that we will incur total future costs of approximately million through to complete the testing required by existing dot regulations 
this estimate does not include the costs  if any  for repair  remediation  preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program itself 
we may incur costs as a result of additional pipeline safety legislation 
the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty and job creation act of was enacted by congress in december and signed into law by the president on january  in addition to reauthorizing federal pipeline safety programs through  this legislation adopts additional safety requirements and reforms and increases penalties for safety violations 
the phmsa has also published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments on the need for changes to its safety regulations  including whether to revise the integrity management requirements and add new regulations governing the safety of gathering lines 
such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations through more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations and higher penalties for the violation of those regulations 
our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in our business or our industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we had approximately million of long term debt outstanding as of december  our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and business prospects 
our substantial debt could have important consequences to our unitholders 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital  to engage in development activities  or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt or to comply with any restrictive covenants or terms of our debt  result in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness  which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit our lenders to foreclose on any of the collateral securing such debt  in the event of default or a default being created by a distribution  we will be prohibited to declare or pay a distribution  
table of contents require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  increase our cost of borrowing  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non strategic divestitures  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or industry in which we operate  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploring  and impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  our ability to make cash distributions may be diminished and our financial leverage could increase 
historically  we have used our cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and issuances of equity to fund our capital program  working capital needs and acquisitions 
our capital program may require additional financing above the level of cash generated by our operations to fund our growth 
if our cash flow from operations decreases as a result of lower throughput volumes on our gathering and processing systems or otherwise  our ability to expend the capital necessary to expand our business or increase our future cash distributions may be limited 
if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy our financing needs  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition or general economic conditions at the time of any such financing or offering 
even if we are successful in obtaining the necessary funds  the terms of such financings could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation  financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
further  incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage and issuing additional limited partner interests may result in significant unitholder dilution and would increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the cash distribution rate which could materially decrease our ability to pay distributions 
if additional capital resources are unavailable  we may curtail our activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
increases in interest rates could adversely impact our unit price  our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes  and our ability to make payments on our debt obligations 
interest rates may increase in the future 
as a result  interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels  causing our financing costs to increase accordingly 
therefore  changes in interest rates either positive or negative  may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units  and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to make payments on our debt obligations 
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located  which could disrupt our operations 
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed  which subjects us to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to obtain and maintain valid easements and rights of way 
we obtain standard easement rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties 
our rights generally revert back to the landowner after we stop using the easement for its specified purpose 

table of contents therefore  these easements exist for varying periods of time 
our loss of easement rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business  thereby resulting in a material reduction in our revenue  earnings and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
our business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be adequately covered by insurance 
the occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not adequately insured could curtail our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
our operations are subject to many risks inherent in the midstream industry including damage to pipelines and plants  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by natural disasters and acts of terrorism  inadvertent damage from construction  farm and utility equipment  leaks or losses of natural gas or ngls as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities  fires and explosions  cyber intrusions  and other hazards that could also result in personal injury  loss of life  pollution or suspension of operations 
these risks could result in curtailment or suspension of our related operations 
a natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
hostile cyber intrusions  including those targeting sensitive customer information  employee and vendor information maintained by us in the normal course of business  as well as breaches in the technology used in our business processes  could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers  as well as significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of such risks and losses in accordance with customary industry practice 
for example  we do not have any property insurance on any of our underground pipeline systems that would cover damage to the pipelines 
we are not insured against all environmental incidents  claims or damages that might occur 
any significant accident or event that is not adequately insured could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we may be unable to economically obtain or maintain the insurance that we desire 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could escalate further 
in some instances  certain insurance could become unavailable or available only at reduced coverage levels 
any type of catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 
our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management  as well as on our ability to attract and retain senior management 
our senior executive officers have significant experience in the natural gas industry and have developed strong relationships with a broad range of industry participants 
the loss of any of these executives could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these industry participants  our results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
we do not have employees 
we rely solely on officers and employees of crestwood holdings to operate and manage our business 

table of contents our industry is highly competitive  and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy 
we compete with similar enterprises in our area of operation 
our competitors may expand or construct gathering systems and associated infrastructure that would create additional competition for the services we provide our customers 
our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers 
all of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
we may conduct certain operations through joint ventures that may limit our operational flexibility 
prior to january   our operations in the marcellus shale region were conducted through joint venture arrangements  and we may enter additional joint ventures in the future 
in a joint venture arrangement  we could have less operational flexibility  as actions must be taken in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of the joint venture 
in certain cases we could have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations  we could have limited control on the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to these operations  we could be dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures  we may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets  and we may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in certain areas of mutual interest 
in addition  our joint venture participants may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture  such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture 
the performance and ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under joint venture arrangements is outside our control 
if these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements  our business may be adversely affected 
our joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives  and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays  litigation or operational impasses 
the risks described above or the failure to continue our joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with our joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to conduct business that is the subject of a joint venture  which could in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently solely reliant on the performance of our midstream business and assets  and as a result of this lack of diversification  our ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be adversely impacted 
given the concentration inherent in our business  in that it is entirely reliant on the revenues and cash flows generated from our midstream business and its assets  any adverse developments in the midstream energy industry could impact our ability to generate sufficient cash flows  which could affect the level of distributions to our unitholders 

table of contents if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  we may have material misstatements in our financial statements  and we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner 
we have established internal controls over financial reporting 
however  internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of their inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud 
therefore  even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may be unable to provide financial information in a timely and reliable manner 
any such difficulties or failure may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
during the course of the preparation of our financial statements  we evaluate our internal controls to identify and remediate deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting 
in the event we are unable to identify and correct deficiencies in our internal controls in a timely manner  we may not record  process  summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods required for our financial reporting under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness or within the required deadlines established by the sec 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities  cause unitholders to lose confidence in our reported financial condition  lead to a default under our credit facility and otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks inherent to an investment in us crestwood holdings owns and controls our general partner  which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations 
crestwood holdings and our general partner have conflicts of interest with  and may favor  crestwood holdings interests to the detriment of our unitholders 
crestwood holdings owns and controls our general partner  and appoints all of the directors of our general partner 
some of our general partner s directors  and some of its executive officers  are directors or officers of crestwood holdings or its affiliates 
although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders  the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to crestwood holdings 
therefore  conflicts of interest may arise between crestwood holdings and its affiliates  including our general partner  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders  on the other hand 
in resolving these conflicts of interest  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders 
crestwood holdings is not limited in its ability to compete with us and is not obligated to offer us the opportunity to acquire additional assets or businesses  which could limit our ability to grow and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
crestwood holdings is not prohibited from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us 
in addition  in the future  crestwood holdings may acquire  construct or dispose of additional midstream or other assets and may be presented with new business opportunities  without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct such assets or to engage in such business opportunities 
moreover  while crestwood holdings may offer us the opportunity to buy assets from it or to participate in investments with it  it is under no contractual obligation to do so and we are unable to predict whether or when such acquisitions might be completed 

table of contents cost reimbursements due to crestwood holdings and our general partner for services provided to us or on our behalf will be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
the amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our general partner 
prior to making distributions on our common units  we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur on our behalf 
these expenses will include all costs incurred by crestwood holdings and our general partner in managing and operating us 
our second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of cmlp  dated february   as amended partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us 
the reimbursements to crestwood holdings and our general partner will reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders 
if you are not an eligible holder  you may not receive distributions or allocations of income or loss on your common units  and your common units will be subject to redemption 
we have adopted certain requirements regarding those investors who may own our common units 
eligible holders are us individuals or entities subject to us federal income taxation on the income generated by us or entities not subject to us federal income taxation on the income generated by us  so long as all of the entity s owners are us individuals or entities subject to such taxation 
if you are not an eligible holder  our general partner may elect not to make distributions or allocate income or loss on your units and you run the risk of having your units redeemed by us at the lower of your purchase price cost and the then current market price 
the redemption price will be paid in cash or by delivery of a promissory note  as determined by our general partner 
our general partner s liability regarding our obligations is limited 
our general partner included provisions in its and our contractual arrangements that limit its liability under contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets  and not against our general partner or its assets 
our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner 
our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner s fiduciary duties  even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability 
in addition  we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf 
any such reimbursement or indemnification payments may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders 
our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash  which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions 
we expect that we will distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders and will rely primarily upon external financing sources  including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities  to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures 
as a result  to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally  our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow 
in addition  because we distribute all of our available cash  our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations 
to the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures  the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level 
there are no limitations in our partnership agreement or in crestwood holdings credit facility  on our ability to issue additional units  including units ranking senior to the common units 
the incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense  which  in turn  may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders 

table of contents our general partner may elect to cause us to issue class b and general partner units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to its incentive distribution rights  without the approval of the special committee of its board of directors or the holders of our common units 
this could result in lower distributions to holders of our common units 
our general partner has the right  at any time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters  to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our distributions at the time of the exercise of the reset election 
following a reset election by our general partner  the minimum quarterly distribution will be adjusted to equal the reset minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution 
if our general partner elects to reset the target distribution levels  it will be entitled to receive a number of class b units and general partner units 
the class b units will be entitled to the same cash distributions per unit as our common units and will be convertible into an equal number of common units 
the number of class b units to be issued to our general partner will be equal to that number of common units which would have entitled their holder to an average aggregate quarterly cash distribution in the prior two quarters equal to the average of the distributions to our general partner on the incentive distribution rights in the prior two quarters 
our general partner will be issued the number of general partner units necessary to maintain an interest in us  equivalent to the interest that existed immediately prior to the reset election 
we anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion 
it is possible  however  that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing  or expects to experience  declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may  therefore  desire to be issued class b units  which are entitled to distributions on the same priority as our common units  rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels 
as a result  a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience a reduction in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new class b units and general partner units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels 
holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and  therefore  limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders will have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors 
the board of directors of our general partner is chosen by the sole member of crestwood gas services holdings llc 
furthermore  if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they will have little ability to remove our general partner 
as a result of these limitations  the price at which the common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price 
our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
even if holders of our limited partner units are dissatisfied  they cannot initially remove our general partner without its consent 
the unitholders initially will be unable to remove our general partner without its consent because our general partner and its affiliates currently own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal 
the vote of the holders of at least of all outstanding limited partner units voting together as a single class is required to remove our general partner 
as of december   the general partner and crestwood holdings beneficially owned of our outstanding limited partner units 
as of february   the general partner and crestwood holdings beneficially owned of our limited partner units 

table of contents our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of certain unitholders owning or more of our common units 
unitholders voting rights are further restricted by a provision of our partnership agreement providing that any units held by a person that owns or more of any class of units then outstanding  other than our general partner  its affiliates  their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner  cannot vote on any matter 
our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent 
our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of crestwood holdings to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party 
in such a case  the new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers 
we may issue additional units without unitholder approval  which would dilute existing ownership interests 
our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders 
the issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects our existing unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease  the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished  and the market price of the common units may decline 
crestwood holdings may sell units in the public or private markets  and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units 
as of december   crestwood holdings beneficially held an aggregate of  common units 
the sale of any or all of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market on which common units are traded 
our general partner has a limited call right that may require existing unitholders to sell their units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than of the common units  our general partner will have the right  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  but not the obligation  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price that is not less than their then current market price 
as a result  existing unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment 
existing unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units 
as of december   the general partner and crestwood holdings beneficially owned of our outstanding limited partner units 
as of february  the general partner and crestwood holdings beneficially owned of our limited partner units 

table of contents unitholders liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
a general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states 
a unitholder could be liable in some circumstances for any and all of our obligations as if that unitholder were a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with the applicable limited partnership statute  or unitholder s right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner  to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business 
unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them 
under certain circumstances  unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them 
under section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act  we may not make a distribution to unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution  limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount 
substituted limited partners are liable both for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that were known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for those obligations that were unknown if the liabilities could have been determined from the partnership agreement 
neither liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest nor liabilities that are non recourse to the partnership are counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
the market price of our common units could be volatile due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the market price of our common units could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  most of which we cannot control  including  changes in securities analysts recommendations  public s reaction to our press releases  announcements and our filings with the sec  fluctuations in broader securities market prices and volumes  particularly among securities of midstream companies and securities of publicly traded limited partnerships  changes in market valuations of similar companies  departures of key personnel  commencement of or involvement in litigation  variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of midstream companies  variations in the amount of our quarterly cash distributions  future issuances and sales of our common units  availability of  and sufficient access to  capital  and changes in general conditions in the us economy  financial markets or the midstream industry 
tax risks to common unitholders our tax treatment depends on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of additional entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service were to treat us as a corporation or if we become subject to a material amount of additional entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then it would substantially reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under delaware law  it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated 
table of contents as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
although we do not believe  based upon our current operations that we will be so treated  the internal revenue service irs  could disagree with positions we take or a change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of 
distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses  deductions or credits recognized by us would flow through to our unitholders 
if we were treated as a corporation at the state level  we would likely also be subject to entity level state income tax at varying rates 
moreover  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
the imposition of any entity level taxation  including a federal income tax imposed on us as a corporation or any entity level state taxes  will reduce the amount of cash we can distribute each quarter to the holders of our common units 
therefore  our treatment as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or becoming subject to a material amount of additional state taxes could result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 
our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative  judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations  possibly on a retroactive basis 
the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships  including us  or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative  legislative or judicial interpretation at any time 
for example  from time to time  members of congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships 
one such legislative proposal would eliminate the qualifying income exemption upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 
any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation  affect or cause us to change our business activities  affect the tax considerations of an investment in us  change the character or treatment of portions of our income  adversely affect an investment in our common units or otherwise negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations 
if the irs were to challenge this method or new treasury regulations were issued  we may be required to change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 

table of contents an internal revenue service challenge of the federal income tax positions we have taken or may take may adversely affect the market for our common units  and the cost of any internal revenue service challenge will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
we have not requested any ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions we have taken or may take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we have taken or may take 
a court may not agree with some or all the positions we have taken or may take 
any challenge with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  the costs of any challenge with the irs will result in a reduction in cash available to pay distributions to our unitholders and our general partner and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner 
unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
because our unitholders will be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than cash we distribute  they will be required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state  local and foreign income taxes on their allocable share of our taxable income  whether or not cash is distributed from us 
cash distributions may not equal a unitholder s share of our taxable income or even equal the actual tax liability that results from the unitholder s allocable share of our taxable income 
the tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than expected 
if our unitholders sell units  they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units 
prior distributions to them in excess of the total net taxable income they were allocated for a common unit  which decreased their tax basis in that common unit  will  in effect  become taxable income to them if the common unit is sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that common unit  even if the price they receive is less than their original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  regardless of whether such amount represents gain  may be taxed as ordinary income to our unitholders due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  if they sell their units  they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale 
tax exempt entities and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as employee benefit plans  individual retirement accounts iras keogh plans and other retirement plans  regulated investment companies  real estate investment trusts  mutual funds and non united states persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non united states persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non united states persons will be required to file united states federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
tax exempt entities or foreign persons should consult their tax advisor regarding their investment in our common units 
we will treat each purchaser of units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could result in a unitholder owing more tax and could otherwise adversely affect the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units  we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
any position we take that is inconsistent with applicable treasury regulations may have to be disclosed on our federal income tax 
table of contents return 
this disclosure increases the likelihood that the irs will challenge our positions and propose adjustments to some or all of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from their sale of our common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to their tax returns 
we may adopt certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
when we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions  we will determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our methodologies  subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section b adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our methods  or our allocation of the section b adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets  and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of percent or more of our capital and profits interests during any month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of percent or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for federal tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership for federal tax purposes  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred 
unitholders may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of their investment in our common units 
in addition to federal income taxes  unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  including foreign  state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance  or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property  even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may own assets or conduct business in additional states that impose an income tax 
it is the unitholder s responsibility to file all required federal  foreign  state and local tax returns 

table of contents a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units 
if so  such unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units  such unitholder may no longer be treated as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units
