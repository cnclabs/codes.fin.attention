item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of atlantic american corporation atlantic american or the parent and its subsidiaries collectively with the parent  the company for the years ended december  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
atlantic american is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted primarily through its insurance subsidiaries american southern insurance company and american safety insurance company together known as american southern  and bankers fidelity life insurance company bankers fidelity 
each operating company is managed separately  offers different products and is evaluated on its individual performance 

table of contents critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  in management s belief  conform to general practices within the insurance industry 
the following is an explanation of the company s accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management 
these accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual operating results could differ significantly from management s estimates determined using these policies 
atlantic american does not expect that changes in the estimates determined using these policies will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity  although changes could have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  this liability includes estimates for unpaid losses on claims reported prior to december   future development on those reported claims  unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported and unpaid loss adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred prior to december  quantification of loss estimates for each of these components involves a significant degree of judgment and estimates may vary  materially  from period to period 
estimated unpaid losses on reported claims are developed based on historical experience with similar claims by the company 
development on reported claims  estimates of unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported  and estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses are developed based on the company s historical experience  using actuarial methods to assist in the analysis 
the company s actuaries develop ranges of estimated development on reported and unreported claims as well as loss adjustment expenses using various methods  including the paid loss development method  the reported loss development method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method and the reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
any single method used to estimate ultimate losses has inherent advantages and disadvantages due to the trends and changes affecting the business environment and the company s administrative policies 
further  a variety of external factors  such as legislative changes  medical cost inflation  and others may directly or indirectly impact the relative adequacy of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the company s approach is to select an estimate of ultimate losses based on comparing results of a variety of reserving methods  as opposed to total reliance on any single method 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reviewed periodically for significant lines of business  and when current results differ from the original assumptions used to develop such estimates  the amount of the company s recorded liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is adjusted 
in the event the company s actual reported losses in any period are materially in excess of the previously estimated amounts  such losses  to the extent reinsurance coverage does not exist  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
future policy benefits comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  these liabilities relate primarily to life insurance products and are based upon assumed future investment yields  mortality rates  and withdrawal rates after giving effect to possible risks of adverse deviation 
the assumed mortality and withdrawal rates are based upon the company s experience 
if actual results differ from the initial assumptions  the amount of the company s recorded liability could require adjustment 
deferred acquisition costs comprised of the company s total assets at december  deferred acquisition costs are commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal business and are generally deferred and amortized 
the deferred amounts are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to expense in a systematic manner 
traditional life insurance and long duration health insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing the related liability for policy benefit reserves 
the deferred acquisition costs for property and casualty insurance and short duration health insurance are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are expensed when such costs are deemed not to be recoverable from future premiums for traditional life and long duration health insurance and from the related unearned premiums and investment income for property and casualty and short duration health insurance 
assessments of recoverability for property and casualty and short duration health insurance are extremely sensitive to the estimates of a subsequent year s projected losses related to the unearned premiums 
projected loss estimates for a current block of business for which unearned premiums remain to be earned may vary significantly from the indicated losses incurred in any previous calendar year 

table of contents receivables are amounts due from reinsurers  insureds and agents  and any sales of investment securities not yet settled  and comprised of the company s total assets at december  insured and agent balances are evaluated periodically for collectibility 
annually  the company performs an analysis of the creditworthiness of the reinsurers with whom the company contracts using various data sources 
failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations due to insolvencies  disputes or otherwise could result in uncollectible amounts and losses to the company 
allowances for uncollectible amounts are established  as and when a loss has been determined probable  against the related receivable 
losses are recognized by the company when determined on a specific account basis and a general provision for loss is made based on the company s historical experience 
cash and investments comprised of the company s total assets at december  substantially all of the company s investments are in bonds and common and preferred stocks  the values of which are subject to significant market fluctuations 
the company carries all investments as available for sale and  accordingly  at their estimated fair values 
the company owns certain fixed maturities that do not have publicly quoted values  but had an estimated fair value as determined by management of million at december  such values inherently involve a greater degree of judgment and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility than the value of securities with publicly quoted market values 
on occasion  the value of an investment may decline to a value below its amortized purchase price and remain at such value for an extended period of time 
when an investment s indicated fair value has declined below its cost basis for a period of time  the company evaluates such investment for an other than temporary impairment 
the evaluation for an other than temporary impairment is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  an issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates 
in evaluating a potential impairment  the company considers  among other factors  management s intent and ability to hold these securities until price recovery  the nature of the investment and the expectation of prospects for the issuer and its industry  the status of an issuer s continued satisfaction of its obligations in accordance with their contractual terms  and management s expectation as to the issuer s ability and intent to continue to do so  as well as ratings actions that may affect the issuer s credit status 
if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to exist  then the company will write down the amortized cost basis of the investment to its estimated fair value 
while any such write down does not impact the reported value of the investment in the company s balance sheet  it is reflected as a realized investment loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations in the period incurred 
the company determines the fair values of certain financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
the fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are largely determined by either independent methods prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners  which do not differ materially from nationally quoted market prices  when available  or independent broker quotations 
see note and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements with respect to assets and liabilities carried at fair value and information about the inputs used to value those financial instruments  by hierarchy level  in accordance with asc deferred income taxes comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for tax purposes 
these deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies

table of contents overall corporate results year ended december  in thousands revenue property and casualty american southern life and health bankers fidelity corporate and other total revenue income loss before income taxes property and casualty american southern life and health bankers fidelity corporate and other income before income taxes net income on a consolidated basis  the company had net income of million  or per diluted share  in  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in included in net income in were realized investment losses of million related to the write down in the cost basis of certain bonds and equity securities due to other than temporary impairments 
there were no similar impairment charges in operating income was million in compared to million in the increase in operating income during was primarily due to an increase in premium revenue and investment income with a relatively consistent level of fixed general and administrative expenses 
operating income is calculated as net income before income tax expense benefit and any net realized investment gains or losses 
management believes operating income is a useful metric for investors  potential investors  securities analysts and others in that it isolates the core results of the company before considering certain items that are either beyond the control of management such as taxes  which are subject to timing and rate changes depending on the timing and location of the associated revenues or not expected to regularly impact the company s operational results such as any realized investment gains  which are not a part of the company s primary operations and are  to an extent  subject to discretion in terms of timing of realization 
total revenue was million in as compared to million in premium revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in premiums was primarily due to increases in medicare supplement business 
the increase in investment income was primarily attributable to a higher average balance of fixed maturities held by the company in as compared to also  included in total revenue were net realized investment gains of million in compared to net realized investment gains of  in the magnitude of realized investment gains and losses in any year is a function of the timing of trades of investments relative to the markets themselves as well as the recognition of any other than temporary impairments on investments 
total expenses were million in as compared to million in as a percentage of premiums  insurance benefits and losses incurred and commissions and underwriting expenses were and in and  respectively 
the increase in the ratio was primarily due to higher loss ratios in the property and casualty operations partially offset by the increase in premium revenue and more favorable loss experience in the life and health operations 
a more detailed analysis of the operating companies and other corporate activities follows 

table of contents underwriting results american southern the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  american southern s premiums  losses  expenses and underwriting ratios year ended december  dollars in thousands gross written premiums ceded premiums net written premiums net earned premiums net losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting expenses underwriting loss loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio gross written premiums at american southern decreased million  or  during as compared to the decrease in gross written premiums was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in commercial automobile written premiums primarily resulting from the cancellation of two agencies in due to unfavorable loss experience  as well as the cancellation of certain general liability programs with gross written premiums of million 
also contributing to the decrease in gross written premiums was a decline in surety business in the amount of million due to the strengthening of the company s underwriting guidelines with respect to such business 
partially offsetting the decrease in gross written premiums in were increases of million in commercial automobile business written by a newly appointed agency and million in commercial automobile business written by an existing agency 
in an effort to increase gross written premiums and diversify its business  american southern continually evaluates new underwriting programs and expects to be able to offset the decrease in business writings from cancelled agencies and or programs 
ceded premiums increased million  or  during as compared to the increase in ceded premiums was primarily due to increased cession rates as well as an increase in commercial automobile earned premiums which have higher contractual cession rates than other lines of business 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  american southern s net earned premiums by line of business year ended december  in thousands automobile liability automobile physical damage general liability property surety total 
table of contents net earned premiums decreased slightly during as compared to the decrease in net earned premiums during was primarily attributable to the increase in reinsurance rates as well as the decrease in general liability business as discussed previously 
partially offsetting the decrease were increases in commercial automobile and surety earned premiums resulting from a higher volume of business written in the current year and during premiums are earned ratably over their respective policy terms  and therefore premiums earned in the current year are related to policies written during both the current year and immediately preceding year 
in  american southern s five principal states in terms of premium revenue were alabama  florida  georgia  indiana  and texas and accounted for approximately of total earned premiums for the performance of an insurance company is often measured by its combined ratio 
the combined ratio represents the percentage of losses  loss adjustment expenses and other expenses that are incurred for each dollar of premium earned by the company 
a combined ratio of under represents an underwriting profit while a combined ratio of over indicates an underwriting loss 
the combined ratio is divided into two components  the loss ratio the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and the expense ratio the ratio of expenses incurred to premiums earned 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses at american southern increased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of premiums  net losses and loss adjustment expenses were in compared to in the increase in the loss ratio during was primarily attributable to increases in the frequency and severity of claims in the commercial automobile line of business and higher claims in the general liability line of business 
partially offsetting the increase in the loss ratio was more favorable loss development in the surety line of business in as compared to underwriting expenses decreased million  or during as compared to as a percentage of premiums  underwriting expenses were in compared to in the decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to american southern s variable commission structure  which compensates the company s agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write 
during periods in which the loss ratio increases  commissions and underwriting expenses will generally decrease  and conversely  during periods in which the loss ratio decreases  commissions and underwriting expenses will generally increase 
in  these commission accruals at american southern decreased million as compared to due to increased loss experience 
in establishing reserves  american southern initially reserves for losses at the higher end of the reasonable range if no other value within the range is determined to be more probable 
selection of such an initial loss estimate is an attempt by management to give recognition that initial claims information received generally is not conclusive with respect to legal liability  is generally not comprehensive with respect to magnitude of loss and generally  based on historical experience  will develop more adversely as time and information develops 
however  as a result  american southern generally experiences reserve redundancies when analyzing the development of prior year losses in a current period 
at december   the range of estimates developed in connection with the loss reserves for american southern indicated that reserves could be as much as lower or as much as higher 
development from prior years reserves has historically reduced the current year loss ratio  however  such reduction in the current year loss ratio is generally offset by the reserves established in the current year for current period losses 
american southern s estimated net reserve redundancies for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
to the extent reserve redundancies vary between years  there is an incremental impact on the results of operations of american southern and the company 
the indicated redundancy in was million less than that in after considering the impact on contingent commissions and other related accruals  the million decline in the redundancy resulted in a decline in income from operations before tax of approximately million in as compared to management believes that such differences will continue in future periods but is unable to determine if or when incremental redundancies will increase or decrease  until the underlying losses are ultimately settled 

table of contents contingent commissions  if contractually applicable  are ultimately payable to agents based on the underlying profitability of a particular insurance contract or a group of insurance contracts  and are periodically evaluated and accrued as earned 
approximately of american southern s business provides for contractual commission arrangements which compensate the company s agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write 
by structuring its business in this manner  american southern provides its agents with an economic incentive to place profitable business with american southern 
in periods in which loss reserves reflect favorable development from prior years reserves  there is generally a highly correlated increase in commission expense also related to the prior year business 
accordingly  favorable loss development from prior years  while anticipated to continue in future periods  is not an indicator of significant additional profitability in the current year 
bankers fidelity the following summarizes  for the periods indicated  bankers fidelity s premiums  losses and expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands medicare supplement other health products life insurance total earned premiums insurance benefits and losses underwriting expenses total expenses underwriting income loss loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio premium revenue at bankers fidelity increased million  or  during as compared to premiums from the medicare supplement line of business increased million  or  in as compared to  due primarily to an increase in business generated from the company s core producers  new business issued in the state of missouri as a result of favorable pricing compared to competitors  and active management and implementation of rate increases on renewal business  as appropriate 
other health product premiums increased million  or  during as compared to  primarily as a result of new sales of the company s short term care products 
premiums from the life insurance line of business increased million  or  in from due to new sales activity 
in  the company s five principal states in terms of premium revenue were georgia  missouri  indiana  ohio  and pennsylvania and accounted for approximately of total premiums for benefits and losses increased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of premiums  benefits and losses were in compared to in the decrease in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to more favorable loss experience in the medicare supplement line of business in as compared to the company continues to implement rate increases on its medicare supplement line of business which has helped to mitigate the impact of higher medical costs and contributed to the more favorable loss experience 
underwriting expenses increased million  or  during as compared to the increase in underwriting expenses during was primarily attributable to increased commission and underwriting costs associated with the increased level of premiums earned as well as increases in advertising and agency related expenses 
advertising expenses increased million in as compared to and included charges for television commercials  social media campaigns  and branding initiatives 
as a percentage of earned premiums  these expenses were in compared to in the decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a relatively consistent level of overall fixed general and administrative expenses 

table of contents investment income and realized gains investment income increased million  or  in as compared to the increase in investment income was primarily attributable to an increase in yield on invested assets and a higher average balance of fixed maturities held by the company in as compared to the company had net realized investment gains of million in compared to net realized investment gains of  in the net realized investment gains in were primarily due to the sale of several of the company s investments in fixed maturities 
the net realized investment gains in resulted from the disposition of several of the company s investments in fixed maturities and a million gain from the sale of an outparcel of land held within one of the company s real estate partnership investments 
partially offsetting the realized investment gains was an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to certain of the company s investments in certain bonds and equity securities 
management continually evaluates the company s investment portfolio and  as may be determined to be appropriate  makes adjustments for impairments and or will divest investments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense increased slightly in as compared to interest expense on the company s bank debt and outstanding trusted preferred obligations is directly related to the average london interbank offered rate libor  which likewise has remained relatively unchanged over the past two years 
the company s revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo expired on august   the stated maturity date  by its terms 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other expenses other expenses commissions  underwriting expenses  and other expenses increased million  or  in as compared to the increase in other expenses during was primarily attributable to increased commission and underwriting costs in the life and health operations associated with the higher volume of business as well as increases in advertising and agency related expenses 
partially offsetting the increase in other expenses in was the million decrease in commission accruals at american southern due to recent loss experience 
the majority of american southern s business is structured in a way that agents are compensated based upon the loss ratios of the business they place with the company 
during periods in which the loss ratio increases  commissions and underwriting expenses will generally decrease  and conversely  during periods in which the loss ratio decreases  commissions and underwriting expenses will generally increase 
as a percentage of earned premiums  other expenses were in as compared with in the decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a relatively consistent level of fixed general and administrative expenses and a reduction in american southern s commission expense as discussed previously 
income taxes the primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory income tax rate resulted from the dividends received deduction drd  the small life insurance company deduction sld and the change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the current estimated drd is adjusted as underlying factors change and can vary from the estimates based on  but not limited to  actual distributions from these investments as well as the amount of the company s taxable income 
the sld varies in amount and is determined at a rate of percent of the tentative life insurance company taxable income licti 
the sld for any taxable year is reduced but not below zero by percent of the tentative licti for such taxable year as it exceeds million and is ultimately phased out at million 
the change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance was primarily due to the unanticipated utilization of certain capital loss carryforward benefits that had been previously reduced to zero through an existing valuation allowance reserve 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the primary cash needs of the company are for the payment of claims and operating expenses  maintaining adequate statutory capital and surplus levels  and meeting debt service requirements 
current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but generally are expected to continue within historical ranges 
the company s primary sources of cash are written premiums  investment income and proceeds from the sale and maturity of its invested assets 
the company believes that  within each operating company  total invested assets will be sufficient to satisfy all policy liabilities and that cash inflows from investment earnings  future premium receipts and reinsurance collections will be adequate to fund the payment of claims and expenses as needed 
cash flows at the parent are derived from dividends  management fees  and tax sharing payments  as described below  from the subsidiaries 
the cash needs of the parent are for the payment of operating expenses  the acquisition of capital assets and debt service requirements 
at december   the parent had approximately million of unrestricted cash and investments 
dividend payments to a parent corporation by its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries are subject to annual limitations and are restricted to the greater of of statutory surplus or statutory earnings before recognizing realized investment gains of the individual insurance subsidiaries 
at december   the parent s insurance subsidiaries had an aggregate statutory surplus of million 
dividends were paid to atlantic american by its subsidiaries totaling million and million in and  respectively 
the parent provides certain administrative  purchasing and other services to each of its subsidiaries 
the amounts charged to and paid by the subsidiaries for these services were million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  the parent has a formal tax sharing agreement with each of its insurance subsidiaries 
a net total of million and million were paid to the parent under the tax sharing agreements in and  respectively 
as a result of the parent s tax loss carryforwards  which totaled approximately million at december   it is anticipated that the tax sharing agreements will continue to provide the parent with additional funds to assist in meeting its cash flow obligations 
the company s revolving credit facility the credit agreement with wells fargo expired on august   the stated maturity date  by its terms 
there were no balances outstanding under the credit agreement at that time 
the company has not entered into any replacement credit facility  but expects that it will evaluate the need to enter into any such facility when  as and if necessary in the future 
the company has two statutory trusts which exist for the exclusive purpose of issuing trust preferred securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trusts and investing the gross proceeds of the trust preferred securities in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures junior subordinated debentures 
the outstanding million and million of junior subordinated debentures mature on december  and may   respectively  are callable quarterly  in whole or in part  only at the option of the company  and have an interest rate of three month libor plus an applicable margin 
the margin ranges from to 
at december   the effective interest rate was 
the obligations of the company with respect to the issuances of the trust preferred securities represent a full and unconditional guarantee by the parent of each trust s obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities 
subject to certain exceptions and limitations  the company may elect from time to time to defer junior subordinated debenture interest payments  which would result in a deferral of distribution payments on the related trust preferred securities 
the company has not made such an election 
during  the company entered into a zero cost interest rate collar with wells fargo to hedge future interest payments on a portion of the junior subordinated debentures 
the notional amount of the collar was million with an effective date of march  the collar has a libor floor of and a libor cap of and adjusted quarterly on the th of each march  june  september and december through its termination date of march  the company began making payments to wells fargo under the zero cost interest rate collar on june  as a result of interest rates remaining below the libor floor of through  these payments to wells fargo continued through the maturity date 

table of contents the company intends to pay its obligations under the junior subordinated debentures using existing cash balances  dividend and tax sharing payments from the operating subsidiaries  or from potential future financing arrangements 
at december   the company had  shares of series d preferred stock series d preferred stock outstanding 
all of the shares of series d preferred stock are held by an affiliate of the company s controlling shareholder 
the outstanding shares of series d preferred stock have a stated value of per share  accrue annual dividends at a rate of per share payable in cash or shares of the company s common stock at the option of the board of directors of the company and are cumulative 
in certain circumstances  the shares of the series d preferred stock may be convertible into an aggregate of approximately  shares of the company s common stock  subject to certain adjustments and provided that such adjustments do not result in the company issuing more than approximately  shares of common stock without obtaining prior shareholder approval  and are redeemable solely at the company s option 
the series d preferred stock is not currently convertible 
as of december  and  the company had accrued  but unpaid  dividends  on the series d preferred stock of  and million  respectively 
during  the company paid million in series d preferred stock dividends 
the series d preferred stock dividend of million was paid in january cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during was primarily due to an increased level of investing exceeding normal sales and maturities 
also contributing to the decrease were cash dividends paid on the company s series d preferred stock and common stock of million and million  respectively  as well as the purchase of shares for treasury for million 
partially offsetting the decrease was the net cash provided by operations during net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at december  of million are believed to be sufficient to meet the company s near term needs 
the company believes that the dividends  fees  and tax sharing payments it receives from its subsidiaries and  if needed  additional borrowings from financial institutions  will enable the company to meet its liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities  which  if implemented  would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
new accounting pronouncements see recently issued accounting standards in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect such losses and expenses  are known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
if  for competitive reasons  premiums cannot be increased to anticipate inflation  this cost would be absorbed by the company 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on the company s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on investment income 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company has structured borrowings that  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  are recorded on the company s balance sheet at an amount that differs from the ultimate contractual obligation
