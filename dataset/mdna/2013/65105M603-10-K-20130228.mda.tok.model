interest rate exposure changes in interest rates  including changes in expected interest rates or yield curves  affect our investments in two distinct ways  each of which is discussed below 
first  changes in interest rates affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our debt obligations and hedges 
one component of our financing strategy includes the use of match funded structures  when appropriate and available 
this means that we seek to match the maturities of our debt obligations with the maturities of our assets to reduce the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities prior to the maturities of our assets  and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings 
in addition  we seek to match fund interest rates on our assets with like kind debt ie  fixed rate assets are financed with fixed rate debt and floating rate assets are financed with floating rate debt  directly or through the use of interest rate swaps  caps or other financial instruments see below  or through a combination of these strategies  which we believe allows us to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings 
however  increases in interest rates can nonetheless reduce our net interest income to the extent that we are not completely match funded 
furthermore  a period of rising interest rates can negatively impact our return on certain floating rate investments 
although these investments may be financed with floating rate debt  the interest rate on the debt may reset prior to  and in some cases more frequently than  the interest rate on the assets  causing a decrease in return on equity during a period of rising interest rates 
as of december   a basis point increase in short term interest rates would increase our earnings by approximately million per annum  based on the current net floating rate exposure from our investments  financings and interest rate derivatives 
second  changes in the level of interest rates also affect the yields required by the marketplace on debt 
increasing interest rates would decrease the value of the fixed rate assets we hold at the time because higher required yields result in lower prices on existing fixed rate assets in order to adjust their yield upward to meet the market 
changes in unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in market interest rates do not directly affect our cash flows  or our ability to pay a dividend  as the related assets are expected to be held and their fair value is not directly relevant to their underlying cash flows 
our assets are largely financed to maturity through long term cdo financings that are not redeemable as a result of book value changes 
as long as these fixed rate assets continue to perform as expected  our cash flows from these assets would not be affected by increasing interest rates 
changes in unrealized gains or losses would impact our ability to realize gains on existing investments if they were sold 
furthermore  with respect to changes in unrealized gains or losses on investments which are carried at fair value  changes in unrealized gains or losses would impact our net book value and  in the cases of impaired assets and non hedge derivatives  our net income 
changes in the value of our assets could affect our ability to borrow and access capital 
also  if the value of our assets subject to short term financing were to decline  it could cause us to fund margin and affect our ability to refinance such assets upon the maturity of the related financings  adversely impacting our rate of return on such securities 
as of december   a basis point change in short term interest rates would impact our net book value by approximately million  based on the current net fixed rate exposure from our investments and interest rate derivatives 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged with a third party counterparty over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
in general  our swaps are pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of floating rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from us 
this can effectively convert a floating rate debt obligation into a fixed rate debt obligation 
interest rate swaps may be subject to margin calls 
similarly  an interest rate cap or floor agreement is a contract in which we purchase a cap or floor contract on a notional face amount 
we will make an upfront payment to the counterparty for which the counterparty agrees to make future payments to us should the reference rate typically libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
while a reit may utilize these types of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities or for other purposes  such derivative instruments could generate income that is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining reit status 
as a consequence  we may only engage in such instruments to hedge such risks within the constraints of maintaining our standing as a reit 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in credit risk 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
credit spread exposure credit spreads measure the yield demanded on loans and securities by the market based on their credit relative to us treasuries  for fixed rate credit  or libor  for floating rate credit 
our fixed rate loans and securities are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate us treasuries of like maturity 
our floating rate loans and securities are valued based on a market credit spread over libor 
excessive supply of such loans and securities combined with reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on such loans and securities  resulting in the use of a higher or wider spread over the benchmark rate to value them 
widening credit spreads would result in higher yields being required by the marketplace on loans and securities 
this widening would reduce the value of the loans and securities we hold at the time because higher required yields result in lower prices on existing securities in order to adjust their yield upward to meet the market 
the effects of such a decrease in values on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity are discussed above under interest rate exposure 
as of december   a basis point movement in credit spreads would impact our net book value by approximately million  assuming a static portfolio of current investments and financings  but would not directly affect our earnings or cash flow 
our financing strategy is dependent on our ability to place the match funded debt we use to finance our investments at rates that provide a positive net spread 
currently  spreads for such liabilities have widened and demand for such liabilities has become extremely limited  therefore restricting our ability to execute future financings 
in an environment where spreads are tightening  if spreads tighten on the assets we purchase to a greater degree than they tighten on the liabilities we issue  our net spread will be reduced 
credit risk in addition to the above described market risks  newcastle is subject to credit risk 
credit risk refers to the ability of each individual borrower under our loans and securities to make required interest and principal payments on the scheduled due dates 
the commercial mortgage and asset backed securities we invest in are generally junior in right of payment of interest and principal to one or more senior classes  but benefit from the support of one or more subordinate classes of securities or other form of credit support which absorbs losses before the securities in which we invest within a securitization transaction 
the senior unsecured reit debt securities we invest in reflect comparable credit risk 
the value of the subordinated securities has generally been reduced or  in some cases  eliminated  which could leave our securities economically in a first loss position 
we also invest in loans and securities which represent first loss pieces  in other words  they do not benefit from credit support although we believe at acquisition they predominantly benefit from underlying collateral value in excess of their carrying amounts 
we seek to reduce credit risk by actively monitoring our asset portfolio and the underlying credit quality of our holdings and  where appropriate and achievable  repositioning our investments to upgrade their credit quality 
in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  loan and collateral defaults may increase and result in credit losses that would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations market considerations and elsewhere in this annual report  adverse market and credit conditions have resulted in our recording of other than temporary impairment in certain securities and loans 
prepayment speed exposure prepayment speeds significantly affect the value of excess msrs 
prepayment speed is the measurement of how quickly borrowers pay down the unpaid principal balance of their loans or how quickly loans are otherwise brought current  modified  liquidated or charged off 
the price we pay in acquiring msrs investments will be based on  among other things  our projection of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans 
our expectation of prepayment speeds is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections 
if prepayment speeds are significantly greater than expected  the carrying value of excess msrs could exceed their estimated fair value 
if the fair value of excess msrs decreases  we would be required to record a non cash charge  which would have a negative impact on our financial results 
furthermore  a significant increase in prepayment speeds could materially reduce the ultimate cash flows we receive from excess msrs  and we could ultimately receive substantially less than what we paid for such assets 
we seek to reduce our exposure to prepayment through the structuring of our investments in excess msrs 
for example  we will seek to enter into recapture agreements whereby we will receive a new excess msr with respect to a loan that was originated by the servicer and used to repay a loan underlying an excess msr that we previously acquired from that same servicer 
in lieu of receiving an excess msr with respect to the loan used to repay a prior loan  the servicer may supply a similar excess msr 
we will seek to enter into such recapture agreements in order to protect our returns in the event of a rise in voluntary prepayment rates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies for a sensitivity analysis of and changes in key assumptions on the estimated fair value of excess msrs margin we are subject to margin calls on our repurchase agreements 
furthermore  we may  from time to time  be a party to derivative agreements or financing arrangements that are subject to margin calls based on the value of such instruments 
we seek to maintain adequate cash reserves and other sources of available liquidity to meet any margin calls resulting from decreases in value related to a reasonably possible in the opinion of management change in interest rates 
interest rate and credit spread risk sensitive instruments and fair value our holdings of such financial instruments  and their fair values and the estimation methodology thereof  are detailed in note to part ii
