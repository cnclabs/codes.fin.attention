overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new oncology therapeutics for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers 
our efforts are currently focused primarily on the development of vosaroxin for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  or aml 
in december  we commenced enrollment of a phase  multi national  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  pivotal trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory aml  or the valor trial 
the valor trial is designed to evaluate the effect of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine  a widely used chemotherapy in aml  on overall survival as compared to placebo in combination with cytarabine  and is being conducted at more than study sites in the us  canada  europe  south korea  australia and new zealand 
in september  following the recommendation of the trial s independent data and safety monitoring board  or dsmb  after the dsmb s completion of a single  pre planned interim analysis of unblinded efficacy and safety data sets from the valor trial  we implemented a one time  patient sample size increase to the valor trial  bringing target enrollment to approximately patients 
this pre specified sample size increase is designed to maintain adequate statistical power over a broader range of survival outcomes 
we anticipate reaching full enrollment of the valor trial in  and unblinding in the first half of  after reaching events in the trial and locking the final database 
we are also preparing the final clinical study reports and manuscripts for two completed clinical trials of vosaroxin a the phase portion of a phase b trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory aml  and b a phase trial in previously untreated patients age years or older with aml  or reveal  which explored three dosing schedules of vosaroxin 

table of contents in march  patient dosing commenced in the li trial  a phase randomized  controlled  multi center trial evaluating novel treatment regimens against low dose cytarabine  or lodac  in patients older than years with aml or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds 
in this trial sponsored by cardiff university and conducted by the ncri haematological oncology study group  several treatments  including two regimens containing vosaroxin  are being evaluated for the primary endpoints of overall survival  complete remission rate and duration of response 
treatment arms meeting efficacy criteria as determined by the data monitoring and ethics committee at the first interim analysis will be expanded initially from to patients per arm 
a second interim analysis will then take place  and for treatments showing promising survival trends  an additional patients per arm will be enrolled  and the trial for these treatment arms will transition into a phase design with the primary endpoint of overall survival for the aggregate of patients enrolled in each treatment arm versus in the lodac control arm 
in june  we received an event based payment of million from biogen idec for the advancement of pre clinical work under the restated biogen idec agreement 
we own worldwide development and commercialization rights to vosaroxin 
in april  the european commission granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of aml  which may provide for years of marketing exclusivity in all member countries of the european union following product approval for this indication in europe 
in  vosaroxin received orphan drug designation for the treatment of aml from the us food and drug administration  or fda 
in february  the fda granted fast track designation to vosaroxin for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory aml in combination with cytarabine 
during  we were granted  or notified of allowance of  a number of key patents for vosaroxin  as follows in february  the uspto granted us patent no 
 covering certain vosaroxin hydrate forms  which will expire in corresponding applications are pending in other major markets  including europe  japan  australia and canada 
in march  the uspto granted us patent no 
 covering certain compositions related to vosaroxin  which will expire in corresponding patent applications are pending internationally 
recent financial history royalty agreement on march   we entered into the royalty agreement with rpi  an entity related to royalty pharma 
on september   as a result of the recommendation by the dsmb to increase the sample size for the valor trial  rpi made a million cash payment to us in exchange for a royalty on any future net sales of vosaroxin 
in conjunction with the royalty agreement  we issued two five year warrants to rpi  each to purchase  shares of our common stock  at exercise prices of and per share  respectively 
loan agreement on october   we entered into the loan agreement with the lenders  and received the first tranche of million from the lenders 
on september   following the recommendation by the dsmb to increase the sample size for the valor trial  we drew the second tranche of million from the lenders 
in connection with this drawdown  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the lenders at an exercise price of per share 
payments under both tranches were interest only until february   with the following equal monthly payments of principal and interest being paid monthly in arrears through the scheduled maturity date of october  
table of contents equity financing in april and august  we entered into two controlled equity offering sales agreements with cantor fitzgerald co  or cantor  pursuant to each of which we could issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million under each agreement from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal  or the cantor facility and the cantor facility  respectively  and collectively the cantor facilities 
we agreed to pay cantor a commission of of the gross proceeds from sales under each facility 
during  we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock under the cantor facilities at an average price of approximately per share for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million  after deducting cantor s commission 
as of december   the cantor facility had been fully utilized and million of common stock remained available to be sold under the cantor facility 
during  an aggregate of  shares of common stock were issued following the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the underwritten offering completed in october  or the offering  for cash at per share  resulting in proceeds to us of million 
capital requirements we have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development process and seek regulatory approvals for vosaroxin 
we believe that we currently have the resources to fund our operations through we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and potential commercialization of vosaroxin  and expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through equity issuances  debt arrangements  one or more possible licenses  collaborations or other similar arrangements with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  or a combination of the above 
however  we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise required funding on acceptable terms or at all  we will need to reduce operating expenses  enter into a collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  outlicense intellectual property rights to vosaroxin  sell unsecured assets  or a combination of the above  or be forced to delay or reduce the scope of our vosaroxin development program  potentially including the valor trial  and or limit or cease our operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for equity financing in october  we completed the offering  in which we sold our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
due to the potential for the warrants to be settled in cash upon the occurrence of certain transactions specified in the warrant agreements  the warrants are being accounted for as a derivative liability as opposed to permanent equity 
outstanding warrants under this arrangement are revalued to their fair value at each period end  with the change in fair value recorded to other income expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
the black scholes model was selected as the most appropriate method to estimate both the initial and subsequent fair values of the warrants 
the determination of initial and subsequent fair values is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
changes in these input variables have  and will continue to  affect the income or expense recorded each period for the revaluation of outstanding warrants 
as a result  fluctuations in our stock price or other input variables may significantly affect our financial results 
accounting for royalty agreement in march  we entered into the royalty agreement with rpi  and in september  as a result of the recommendation by the dsmb to increase the sample size for the valor trial  rpi made a million cash payment to us in exchange for a royalty on any future net sales of vosaroxin 
in conjunction with the royalty agreement  we issued two five year warrants to rpi  each to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the payment of million by rpi is non refundable  and no revenue participation right payments will be made unless vosaroxin successfully completes the valor trial and is subsequently commercialized 
accordingly  the payment  less a portion representing the fair value of the warrants of million  is being accounted for as consideration for our commitment to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the valor trial and commercialize vosaroxin 
the net amount of million has therefore been classified as deferred revenue and is being amortized to revenue over the related estimated performance period  and the fair value of the warrants has been recorded to additional paid in capital 
the black scholes model was selected as the most appropriate method to estimate the fair value of the warrants 
the black scholes model requires several subjective inputs such as expected term and share price volatility  which require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
revenue recognition revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification subtopic  multiple element arrangements  or asc under asc  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer 
consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair value  and the applicable revenue recognition is applied to each of the separate units 
non refundable fees where we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
in situations where continuing performance obligations exist  non refundable fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the projected performance period 

table of contents milestone payments from license or collaboration agreements which are substantive and at risk at the time the agreement is executed are recognized upon completion of the applicable milestone event 
royalty revenues  if any  will be recognized based on reported product sales by third party licensees 
research funding from any future agreement will be recognized as the related research services are performed 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical trial costs  which include payments for work performed by contract research organizations  or cros  and participating clinical trial sites 
these costs are generally a significant component of research and development expense 
costs incurred for setting up clinical trial sites for participation in trials are generally non refundable  and are expensed as incurred  with any refundable advances related to enrollment of the first patient recorded as prepayments and assessed for recoverability on a quarterly basis 
costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients progress through the clinical trial  including amortization of any first patient prepayments 
this amortization generally matches when the related services are rendered  however  these cost estimates may or may not match the actual costs incurred by the cros or clinical trial sites  and if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  our clinical trial accruals may not be accurate 
the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been significant to date 
overview of revenues we have not generated  and do not expect to generate in the near future  any revenue from sales of commercial products 
we cannot predict whether we will receive any additional pre commercialization event based or royalty payments from these agreements in the foreseeable future  or at all 
overview of operating expenses research and development expense 
most of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities  and include costs incurred in the preparation and execution of clinical trials  including those for vosaroxin  in the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics  in the development of novel fragment based drug discovery methods  in the development and use of in house research  preclinical study and development capabilities  in connection with in licensing activities  and in the conduct of activities related to strategic collaborations 
we are currently focused solely on the development of vosaroxin for the treatment of aml 
based on results of translational research  our own and investigator sponsored trials  regulatory and competitive concerns and our overall financial resources  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which indications to pursue and patient populations to treat in the future  and how much funding to direct to each indication  which will affect our research and development expense 
we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional research expenses related to the discovery of additional product candidates  the development or application of fragment based drug discovery methods  the development of in house research capabilities  or on the clinical development of product candidates other than 
table of contents vosaroxin 
in addition  we are no longer conducting any research activities in connection with collaboration agreements 
however  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased levels of research and development expenses to conduct further clinical and related development of vosaroxin 
if we engage a development or commercialization partner for our vosaroxin program  or if  in the future  we acquire additional product candidates  our research and development expenses could be significantly affected 
we cannot predict whether future licensing or collaborative arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
under an amended and restated agreement with biogen idec executed in march to provide for the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule inhibitors of a unique preclinical kinase inhibitor program involved in immunology  or the restated biogen idec agreement  and a license agreement entered into with millennium pharmaceuticals  inc in march pursuant to which we granted millennium exclusive licenses for the development of our oral  selective pan raf kinase inhibitor and one additional undisclosed kinase inhibitor program in oncology  or the millennium agreement  we have the right to participate in co development and co promotion activities for the related product candidates 
if we were to exercise our option on one or more product candidates  our research and development expense would increase significantly 
as of december   we had incurred million of expenses in the development of vosaroxin since it was licensed from dainippon sumitomo pharma co  ltd  or dainippon  in october we expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the development of vosaroxin in and future years 
due to the above uncertainties and other risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to estimate the costs we will incur in the vosaroxin development program in the future 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for the related employees  including non cash stock based compensation  professional service costs  including fees paid to outside legal advisors  marketing consultants and our independent registered public accounting firm  facilities expenses  and other administrative costs 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue was million in as compared to million in revenue in was comprised of million received from biogen idec in june for the advancement of pre clinical work under the restated biogen idec agreement and million of deferred revenue recognized in related to the royalty agreement with rpi 
revenue in was comprised of an upfront payment of million that we received from millennium in relation to the termination and transition agreement that we entered into with biogen idec and millennium in march  and million that we received as a result of the repayment by sarcode of three promissory notes that had been issued to us upon entering into a license agreement with them in march we expect our revenue to be higher in as compared to  due to continued recognition of deferred revenue related to the royalty agreement with rpi 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in as compared to million in  substantially all relating to the vosaroxin development program in each year 
the increase of million in was primarily due to increases of million in clinical trial expenses  million in outside services and consulting costs  and million in personnel costs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in as compared to million in the increase of million in was primarily due to higher non cash stock based compensation expense and other personnel related costs

research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in as compared to million in  substantially all relating to the vosaroxin development program in each year 
the increase of million in was primarily due to increases of million in clinical trial expenses as a result of the ramp up of the valor trial and million for drug manufacturing activities  partially offset by a reduction in milestone payments of million 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in as compared to million in the increase of million in was primarily due to increases of million in personnel costs and million in professional service costs

other income expense  net 
net other income was million in as compared to net other expense of million in net other income in was primarily comprised of net non cash credits of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering 
net other expense in was primarily due to a non cash charge of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering  partially offset by the receipt of a tax credit of million 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities may arise from differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their basis for financial reporting 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
our policy is to recognize interest charges and penalties as other expense 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in and the state net operating loss will begin to expire in the state research and development tax credit carry forwards do not expire 
utilization of these net operating loss and tax credits carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change rules under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
the limitations are applicable if an ownership change  as defined in the code  is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carry forwards before they can be utilized 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock  debt financings  and the receipt of funds from our collaboration partners  the sale of revenue participation rights  and research grants 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million as of december   as compared to million as of december  the increase of million was primarily due to the receipt of million from rpi  the draw down of the second tranche loan of million from the lenders  net proceeds from sales of our common stock under the cantor facilities of million  and proceeds from the exercise of warrants  stock options and stock purchase rights of million  partially offset by other net operating cash outflows 
on september   pursuant to the royalty agreement we entered into with rpi  and as a result of the recommendation by the dsmb to increase the sample size for the valor trial  rpi made a million cash payment to us in exchange for a royalty on any future net sales of vosaroxin 
on september   we drew down the million second tranche from the lenders under the loan agreement 
we previously drew down the million first tranche upon execution of the loan agreement in october payments under both tranches were interest only until february   with the following equal monthly payments of principal and interest being paid monthly in arrears through the scheduled maturity date of october  a final payment equal to of the aggregate amount drawn will be due on october   or earlier under certain conditions 
during  we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock under the cantor facilities at an average price of approximately per share for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million  after deducting cantor s commission 
as of december   the cantor facility was fully utilized and million of common stock remained available to be sold under the cantor facility  subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million in as compared to million in and million in net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  partially offset by net adjustments for non cash items of million including net charges of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering and million of stock based compensation  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million including a net increase in deferred revenue of million related to the receipt of the million payment from rpi  and an increase of million in accrued clinical expenses related to the valor trial 
net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million and net adjustments for non cash items of million including a net credit of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering  partially offset by million of stock based compensation  partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  primarily as a result of an increase in accrued clinical expenses related to the valor trial 
net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  partially offset by net adjustments for non cash items of million including million of charges for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million provided by investing activities in and million used in investing activities in net cash used in and 
table of contents consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to million in  and million in net cash provided in included net proceeds from the draw down of the second tranche loan of million from the lenders  million from sales of our common stock through the cantor facilities  million of the million payment allocated to the fair value of warrants issued to rpi  and million from the exercise of warrants  stock options and stock purchase rights 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the loan agreement and million from sales of our common stock through cantor 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from sales of our common stock through cantor  million from sales of our common stock in the third and final closing of the private placement  and million from the offering 
operating cash requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
we will not receive any product revenue until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries  and has been successfully commercialized  if at all 
we will need to raise substantial additional funding to complete the development and potential commercialization of vosaroxin 
additionally  we may evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  including the valor trial in particular  the need for additional or expanded clinical trials  the timing  economic and other terms of any licensing  collaboration or other similar arrangement into which we may enter  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the extent of our other development activities  the costs associated with building or accessing commercialization and additional manufacturing capabilities and supplies  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  if any  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the costs  if any  of supporting our arrangements with biogen idec and millennium 
we believe that we currently have the resources to fund our operations through we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and potential commercialization of vosaroxin 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of licensing or collaboration or product revenue to finance our cash 
table of contents requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through equity issuances  debt arrangements  one or more possible licenses  collaborations or other similar arrangements with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  or a combination of the above 
our failure to raise significant additional capital in the future would force us to delay or reduce the scope of our vosaroxin development program  potentially including the valor trial  and or limit or cease our operations 
any one of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations  including interest operating lease obligations upon the occurrence of an event of default  as defined in the loan agreement  and following any applicable cure periods  a default interest rate of an additional may be applied to the outstanding loan balances  and the lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the loan agreement 
operating lease obligations relate solely to the lease of approximately  square feet of office space in a building at oyster point boulevard in south san francisco  california  which is currently our corporate headquarters 
the lease was entered into in december  and was due to expire on april  in january  we extended the lease to january  the above amounts exclude potential payments under our license agreement with dainippon  pursuant to which we are required to make certain milestone payments in the event we file new drug applications in the united states  europe or japan  and if we receive regulatory approvals in any of these regions  for cancer related indications 
if vosaroxin is approved for a non cancer indication  an additional milestone payment becomes payable to dainippon 
we also have agreements with cros  clinical sites and other third party contractors for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these entities based upon the activities they perform related to the particular clinical trial 
there are generally no penalty clauses for cancellation of these agreements if notice is duly given and payment is made for work performed by the third party under the related agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements since our inception  we have not had any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

table of contents item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale  which  due to their short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate risk exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds and us and european government obligations and corporate debt securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
substantially all investments mature within approximately one year from the date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except obligations of the us treasury or us treasury guaranteed securities  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
the tables below present the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december of each year  by effective maturity in thousands  except percentages expected maturity fair value as of december  months over months total available for sale securities average interest rate expected maturity fair value as of december  months over months total available for sale securities average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
invoices for certain services provided to us are denominated in foreign currencies  including the euro and british pound  among others 
therefore  we are exposed to adverse movements in the related foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage this risk  we may purchase certain european currencies or highly rated investments denominated in those currencies  subject to similar criteria as for other investments allowed by our investment policy 
we do not make these purchases for trading or speculative purposes  and there is no guarantee that the related gains and losses will substantially offset each other 
as of december  and  we held investments denominated in euros with an aggregate fair value of million and million  respectively 
the balances are recorded at their fair value based on the current exchange rate as of each balance sheet date 
the resulting exchange gains or losses and those from amounts payable for services originally denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in other income expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive income loss
