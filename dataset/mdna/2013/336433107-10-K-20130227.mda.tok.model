item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial operations overview net sales systems business  for a listing of these projects 
in europe  we have been engaged in project development activities with respect to certain projects in germany and we are actively evaluating additional project opportunities in turkey and emerging eastern european markets as well as mature western european solar markets 
in asia including india  china and southeast asia  latin america  the middle east and africa  we have been actively pursuing opportunities to offer a complete turn key solar power solution or any combination of our pv systems solutions 
we expect our focus on  and investment in  these markets will continue to increase as we execute our long term strategic plan 
customers with respect to our systems business  our customers consist of investor owned utilities  independent power developers and producers  commercial and industrial companies  and other system owners who may purchase from us completed solar power plants which include our solar modules  any combination of epc services  and o m services for the plants we build 
during  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america 
during  the principal customers of our systems segment were nrg energy  inc  exelon corporation  and midamerican renewables  llc  each of which also accounted for more than of our total net sales during competition with respect to our systems business  we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions  including developers of pv  solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems  and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects  including wind  hydropower  geothermal  biomass  and tidal 
to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated  we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well 
we also face competition from other epc companies and joint venture type arrangements between epc companies and solar companies 
while the decline in pv modules prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar electricity worldwide  competition at the systems level can be intense  thereby exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industry wide  to the extent competitors are willing and able to bid aggressively low prices for new projects and ppas  using low cost assumptions for modules  bos components  installation  maintenance and other costs 
please see item a risk factors competition at the systems level can be intense  depending on the market opportunity  thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industry wide  which could reduce our net sales  profitability and adversely affect our results of operations 
epc warranty in addition to our solar module warranties described above  for solar power plants built by our systems business  we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design  installation  and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant 
in resolving claims under the engineering design  installation  and workmanship warranties  we have the option of remedying the defect through repair  or replacement 
research  development  and engineering our systems business research and development activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the levelized cost of energy through reductions in bos costs  improved systems design  and energy yield enhancements associated with pv systems that use our solar modules 
we conduct our research and development activities for the systems business primarily in the united states 
innovations related to system design  hardware platforms  inverters  trackers  and installation techniques and know how  among other things  can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce bos costs  which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility scale pv solar power system 
support programs support programs for pv solar electricity generation  depending on the jurisdiction  include feed in tariffs fits  quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems  and net energy metering programs 
in addition to these  financial incentives for pv solar electricity generation include tax incentives  grants  loans  rebates  and production incentives 
although we expect to become less impacted by  and less dependent on  support programs as we execute our long term strategic plan and transition into primarily sustainable markets  support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of pv solar systems around the world 
under a basic fit program  producers of renewable energy are paid a set rate for their electricity  usually differentiated according to the technology used and size of the installation 
for pv solar  the rate has historically been set above market rates and is fixed for a period of up to years 
in most countries with fits  grid operators are obliged to provide priority and guaranteed access to the grid for renewable energy installations 
the additional costs of these schemes are generally passed through to the electricity consumers by way of a premium on the kilowatt hour kwh end user price 
these fit subsidies have been critical for the development of the solar industry because they provided the demand visibility required for module manufacturers and other participants in the solar value chain to reduce costs and drive scale 
prior to  the substantial majority of our module sales had been for grid connected ground or commercial roof mounted solar power systems in germany and other european union countries with fit subsidies 
whereas fit laws set the price and let the market determine capacity and generation  quota systems work in reverse 
in general  governments mandate a minimum share of capacity or grid connected generation of electricity to come from renewable energy sources 
this share often increases over time  with a specific final target and end date 
the mandate can be placed on producers  distributors  or consumers 
there are two main types of quota systems used obligation certificate and tendering systems 
a renewable portfolio standard rps is in the former category 
under an rps  regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end user customers from eligible renewable resources  such as solar generating facilities  by a specified date 
some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities 
the majority of states in the us have enacted legislation adopting rps mechanisms 
rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state  particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state s rps mandate  the definition of eligible renewable energy resources  and the extent to which renewable energy credits certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance 
measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate  california s rps program is the most significant in the us  and the california market for renewable energy dominates the western us region 
first enacted in  california s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance 
pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in  the california rps program now requires obligated load serving entities to procure of their retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by in  approximately of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or third party module sales to solar power systems in california 
in contrast to an rps system  tendering systems of procurement such as those used in south africa and india are focused on specific targets for new capacity 
in south africa  for example  the government is procuring bids under a competitive tender with solicitation dates spread over about two years 
the request for proposal rfp is the first major solicitation in support of a target of over gw of renewable energy by in south africa s integrated resource plan of which over gw was allocated to pv solar 
project proponents bid competitively at each solicitation date until all the capacity has been allocated 
the tender solicitation approach allows governments or utilities to proscribe project construction time frames to achieve specific generation targets for the electricity system 
net energy metering programs enable end users to install renewable systems and to offset their retail energy consumption with production from on site facilities and  in some cases  to sell excess solar electricity to their retail electricity provider 
because the bundled cost of retail electricity usually exceeds the cost of unbundled electricity  net energy metering programs provide an incentive to the end user 
the policies governing net energy metering vary by jurisdiction and utility 
some utilities pay the end user in advance  while others credit the end user s bill 
tax incentive programs exist in the us at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits  accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions 
at the federal level  investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the s 
in october  the united states congress extended the federal investment tax credit itc for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years  through december  the itc is a primary economic driver of solar installations in the us its extension through has contributed to greater medium term demand visibility in the us  however  its expiration at the end of unless extended underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity from solar systems to continue to decline toward grid parity 
in europe  renewable energy targets  in conjunction with fits  have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets 
renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources  while fit policies are intended to support new supply development by providing investor certainty 
a european union eu directive for promoting renewable energy use in electricity generation directive ec set varying national indicative targets for renewable energy production from individual member states 
a eu directive on renewable energy directive ec  which replaced the directive  sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directive s goal of a share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by  and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources 
germany  which accounted for approximately of our net sales  is expected to continue to be a small percentage of our net sales due to changes in policy support and demand 
in the context of the discussion on germany s energy strategy energiewende  the german government made significant changes in to the german renewable energy law  or the eeg 
these changes  which began to take effect in the second half of  included significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to mw and an elimination by the end of of fits for projects over mw 
these fit changes particularly impact the competitiveness in germany of our core offering of large scale free field pv systems 
in australia  which accounted for of our net sales  the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and free field applications  including the federal government s national renewable energy target which has set a renewable energy goal of by in india  which accounted for of our net sales  the national solar mission includes a goal of installing gw of solar power generation capability by india also announced a fit policy for the first phase of the national solar mission in there have been significant achievements during the phase i of the national solar mission  and several projects have been awarded ppas under various state programs as of december in december the ministry for new renewable energy released the draft policy for phase ii of the national solar mission  which mentions installation of approximately gw of utility scale and gw of off grid solar power projects by the end of phase ii 
in china  governmental authorities recently adopted a national fit policy for large scale projects 
china also expanded the golden sun program  an upfront cost subsidy program  aimed primarily at distributed generation 
in addition  according to the current draft of the th year plan for solar energy  the government intends to raise the goal for total cumulative solar energy capacity from gw to gw  which was subsequently revised to gw 
in the middle east and north africa mena  several countries have announced sizeable solar targets  although policy mechanisms are in many cases not yet firmly established 
in the kingdom of saudi arabia  a solar policy with a target of gw of solar energy of which at least gws is pv by was introduced in the selection of a market mechanism enabling the deployment of solar power plants is expected in while the expected potential of the mena markets is significant  policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia  political instability  geopolitical risk  fossil fuel subsidization  potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 
for more information about risks related to support programs and related economic incentives  please see item a risk factors reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination  or expiration of government subsidies  economic incentives  and other support for on grid solar electricity applications could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
intellectual property our success depends  in part  on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we rely primarily on a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secrets  as well as associate and third party confidentiality agreements  to safeguard our intellectual property 
we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development  and are currently pursuing patent applications in the us and worldwide 
our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek  or at all  and any patents we may receive may be challenged  invalidated  or declared unenforceable 
in addition  we have registered and or have applied to register  trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for first solar and first solar and design 
with respect to proprietary know how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce  we rely on  among other things  trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests 
we believe that many elements of our pv module manufacturing process  including our unique materials sourcing  involve proprietary know how  technology  or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications  including technical processes  equipment designs  algorithms  and procedures 
we have taken security measures to protect these elements 
our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us 
these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions  designs  and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 
we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our modules  technology  or business plans 
we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 
environmental  health  and safety matters our operations include the use  handling  storage  transportation  generation  and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes 
we are subject to various national  state  local  and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the use  management  and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  occupational health and safety  and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
therefore  we could incur substantial costs  including cleanup costs  fines  and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of  or liabilities under  environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or non compliance with environmental permits required for our operations 
we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future 
however  future developments such as the implementation of new  more stringent laws and regulations  more aggressive enforcement policies  or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition

item a risk factors an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following information  together with the other information in this annual report on form k  before buying shares of our stock 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 
risks related to our markets and customers an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations solar manufacturers had installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie  where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand will continue for the foreseeable future  and we expect that it will continue to put pressure on pricing 
in light of the increase in global production capacity  we engaged in a series of restructuring initiatives in to better align production with expected market demand including the closure of our german manufacturing operations in in  industry average sales prices per watt asps continued to decline  as competitors reduced asps to sell through inventories worldwide 
if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs  or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time  or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
competition at the systems level can be intense  thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industry wide  which could reduce our net sales  profitability and adversely affect our results of operations 
the significant decline in pv module prices over the last several years has and continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers  but it has also increased interest in solar electricity worldwide by eroding one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration  namely its affordability 
aided by such lower module prices  competitors have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas  using low cost assumptions for modules  bos components  installation  maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids 
achievable barriers to entry for competitors has led to  depending on the market and other factors  intense competition at the systems level 
intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which systems level pricing falls rapidly  thereby further increasing demand for solar solutions but constraining the ability for project developers  epc companies and or vertically integrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability 
accordingly  while we believe our systems offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors  we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new systems projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return  and may not be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our long term strategic plan 
depending on the market opportunity  we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systems level competitors 
for example  certain of our competitors may have a stronger and or more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region 
certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and  as a result  may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole 
certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital  which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 
additionally  large scale solar systems are still in their relatively early stages of existence  and  depending on the geographic area  many potential customers are still in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar solutions  including a company s proven overall experience and bankability  system design optimization expertise  grid interconnection and stabilization expertise  and proven o m capabilities 
if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale  from the viewpoint of our potential customer base  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if pv technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return  or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate  our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 
the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development  in comparison to fossil fuel based electricity generation 
if pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate  we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability 
in addition  demand for solar modules and systems in our targeted markets  including north america  latin america  europe  india  china  the middle east  australia  south africa and other foreign jurisdictions  may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate 
many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of pv technology and demand for solar modules and systems  including the following cost effectiveness of the electricity generated by pv power systems compared to conventional energy sources  such as natural gas and coal  and other non solar renewable energy sources  such as wind  performance  reliability and availability of energy generated by pv systems compared to conventional and other non solar renewable energy sources and products  success of other renewable energy generation technologies  such as hydroelectric  tidal  wind  geothermal  solar thermal  concentrated pv  and biomass  fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the price of  and demand for  conventional and non solar renewable energy sources  such as increases or decreases in the price of natural gas  coal  oil  and other fossil fuels  fluctuations in capital expenditures by end users of solar modules and systems which tend to decrease when the economy slows and when interest rates increase  and availability  substance  and magnitude of support programs including government targets  subsidies  incentives  and renewable portfolio standards to accelerate the development of the solar energy industry 
reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination  or expiration of government subsidies  economic incentives  renewable energy targets and other support for on grid solar electricity applications  or increase in protectionist or other adverse public policies  could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in sustainable markets  in the near term our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives support programs 
federal  state  and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits  rebates  tax incentives  and other incentives to end users  distributors  systems integrators  and manufacturers of pv products 
many of these support programs expire  phase out over time  require renewal by the applicable authority  or may be amended 
a summary of recent developments in the major government support programs that can impact our business appears under item business support programs 
to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected  or free field or conversion land applications are disadvantaged  such changes could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules and systems  lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
germany  which accounted for approximately of our net sales  is expected to continue to be a small percentage of our net sales due to changing levels of policy support and demand 
in the context of the discussion on germany s energy strategy energiewende  the german government made significant changes in to the german renewable energy law  or the eeg 
these changes  which began to take effect in the second half of  included significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to mw and an elimination by the end of of fits for projects over mw 
these fit changes particularly impact the competitiveness in germany of our core offering of large scale free field pv systems 
in the middle east and north africa mena  several countries have announced sizeable solar targets  although policy mechanisms in many cases are not yet firmly established 
in the kingdom of saudi arabia  a solar policy with a target of gw of solar energy of which at least gws is pv by was introduced in the selection of a market mechanism enabling the deployment of solar power plants is expected in while the expected potential of the mena markets is significant  policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia  political instability  geopolitical risk  fossil fuel subsidization  potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 
reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination  or expiration of support programs for on grid solar electricity applications could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules and systems  and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india could be adversely affected by protectionist or other adverse public policies 
under phase i of the national solar mission  india required developers of solar pv projects employing crystalline silicon technology to use solar cells and modules manufactured in india 
in its draft policy for phase ii of the national solar mission  india has stated that it is considering imposing similar local content requirements lcrs on thin film solar technologies such as first solar modules  which currently comprise the majority of us solar exports to india 
in february  the united states government announced that it had requested world trade organization dispute settlement consultations with the government of india concerning phase i local content requirements 
in the event india expands its lcrs for the national solar mission to include thin film modules  our ability to participate in the national solar mission will be substantially reduced and possibly completely eliminated  and thus our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india would be adversely affected 
in addition  first solar has received official notice from the indian government that india is investigating potential dumping of solar cells and modules from the us  malaysia  taiwan and china 
first solar is cooperating with the indian government and responding to its questionnaire 
we expect a final decision by the end of  although a preliminary determination is likely to be made during the course of if we are deemed to have dumped our modules in india to the detriment of the domestic industry  we could be assessed anti dumping duties and our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india could be adversely affected 
we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and foreign anti bribery laws 
the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
other countries in which we operate also have anti bribery laws  some of which prohibit improper payments to government and non government persons and entities 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we currently operate in  and pursuant to our long term strategic plan intend to further expand into  many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
in addition  due to the level of regulation in our industry  our entry into certain jurisdictions  including india  china  and the middle east  requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these anti bribery laws  our employees  subcontractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and anti bribery laws 
any such violation  even if prohibited by our policies  could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and reputation 
we may be unable to fully execute on our long term strategic plan  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we face numerous difficulties in executing our long term strategic plan  particularly in new foreign jurisdictions  including the following difficulty in accurately prioritizing geographic markets which we can most effectively and profitably serve with our utility scale pv offerings  including miscalculations in overestimating or underestimating our addressable market demand  difficulty in overcoming the inertia involved in changing local electricity ecosystems as necessary to accommodate large scale pv solar deployment and integration  protectionist or other adverse public policies in countries we operate in and or are pursuing  including local content requirements or capital investment requirements  difficulty in timely identifying  attracting and retaining qualified sales  technical and other personnel in geographies targeted for expansion  the possibility of having insufficient capital resources necessary to achieve an effective localized business presence in targeted jurisdictions  difficulty in competing against competitors who may have greater financial resources and or a more effective or established localized business presence and or be willing and able to operate with little or no operating margins for sustained periods of time  difficulty in competing against competitors who may gain in profitability and financial strength over time by successfully participating in the global rooftop pv solar market  which is a segment we have de emphasized as part of our long term strategic plan  difficulty in developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses  on commercially acceptable terms  and difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner  potentially causing us to be manufacturing capacity constrained in some future periods or over supplied in others 
in addition  please see the risk factors entitled our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks  including unfavorable political  regulatory  labor  and tax conditions in foreign countries  and reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination  or expiration of government subsidiaries  economic incentives  and other support for on grid solar electricity  could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar systems or modules and or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 
many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt and or equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop  build and purchase a pv system 
as a result  an increase in interest rates or lending rates  or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments  could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop  build  purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms  or at all  and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install pv systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates and or lending rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a pv system  increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems  and  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments 
risks related to regulations existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical  regulatory  and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products  which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 
the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign  federal  state  and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry  as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities 
these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer owned electricity generation 
in the united states and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future 
these regulations and policies could deter end user purchases of pv products and investment in the research and development of pv technology 
for example  without a mandated regulatory exception for pv systems  utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid 
if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems  it is likely that they would increase the cost of using pv systems to our end users  which could make them less desirable  thereby adversely affecting our business  prospects  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  with respect to utilities that utilize a peak hour pricing policy or time of use pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand  electricity generated by pv systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peak hour electricity  rather than the less expensive average price of electricity 
modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities  such as to a flat rate for all times of the day  would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources 
we anticipate that our solar systems and modules will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes  safety  environmental protection  utility interconnection and metering  and other matters 
it is a complex task to track the requirements of individual jurisdictions and design equipment to comply with the varying standards 
any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and  as a result  could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar systems and modules 
environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition  cash flows  and profitability 
our operations involve the use  handling  generation  processing  storage  transportation  and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national  state  local  and international levels 
these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the use  management  and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  and occupational health and safety 
as we execute our long term strategic plan and expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide  our environmental compliance burden will continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines  penalties  criminal proceedings  third party property damage or personal injury claims  cleanup costs  or other costs 
such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements  future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies  the implementation of new  more stringent laws and regulations  or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  our solar modules contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide 
elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure 
based on existing research  the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium 
in our manufacturing operations  we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures  including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators  chemical goggles  and protective clothing 
relevant studies and third party peer review of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our end products is negligible 
in addition  the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products and the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of first solar s modules 
while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates  end users  and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure  we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur 
any such exposure could result in future third party claims against us  as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products  which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products 
the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the use of cadmium in various products is also subject to governmental regulation in several countries 
more restrictive regulation in this area and or expansion of such regulation to additional countries could impact the manufacture  sale  collection  and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products 
risks related to our operations  manufacturing  and technology our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 
our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business  financial performance  and prospects 
we may be unable to achieve similar growth  or grow at all  in future periods 
our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions 
our past results occurred in an environment where  among other things  capital was at times more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain markets such as the german fit were more favorable 
accordingly  you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 
we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules  as well as thin film solar modules  and solar thermal and concentrated pv systems  if global supply exceeds global demand  it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
the solar energy and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry 
within the global pv industry  we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers  other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies 
existing or future solar manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources  thereby intensifying competition with us 
in addition  the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
even if demand for solar modules continues to grow  the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many solar module manufacturers  particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules  has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance during which supply exceeds demand 
see an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we believe a significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock would provide further reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules 
during any such period  our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition  even below their manufacturing costs  in order to generate sales 
other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital  which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 
as a result  we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices  or for a profit  during any period of excess supply of solar modules  which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
also  we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 
thin film technology has a short history  and our thin film technology and solar modules and systems may perform below expectations  problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant and or unexpected warranty and related expenses  damage our market reputation  and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 
researchers began developing thin film semiconductor technology over years ago  but were unable to integrate the technology into a solar module production line until about a decade ago 
we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments and warranty of product performance over its expected useful life 
however  if our thin film technology and solar modules perform below expectations  we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 
we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules 
we also typically warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least of their labeled power output rating during the first years following their installation and at least of their labeled power output rating during the following years 
as a result  we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 
as an alternative to our module power output warranty  we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent sales 
as of december   our accrued warranty liability was million  of which  million was classified as current and million was classified as noncurrent 
we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately of modules covered under warranty 
a percentage point change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately million 
during the period from june to june  a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field 
we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules affected by the manufacturing excursion that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts 
we have expensed million total to date for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period 
if any of our assumptions used in estimating the above referenced warranty or manufacturing excursion costs prove incorrect  we could be required to accrue additional expenses  which could adversely impact our financial position  operating results and cash flows 
although we believe we have taken corrective actions to avoid similar manufacturing excursions in the future  we cannot guarantee that our internal quality and testing programs will prevent a future manufacturing excursion from occurring 
any future manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty could adversely impact our financial position  operating results and cash flows 
although our power output warranty extends for years  our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since as a result  our warranty is based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable fact based predictions of durability and future performance 
these predictions  however  could prove to be materially different from the actual performance over the full life of our solar modules  causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future 
for example  our glass on glass solar modules could break  delaminate  corrode  or experience power degradation in excess of expectations  and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to process variations that could cause affected modules to underperform compared to our expectations 
these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our product  accelerate module conversion efficiency and manufacturing production throughput improvements as part of our long term strategic plan 
in addition  as we increase the number of installations in non temperate climates  in accordance with our long term strategic plan  we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such climates 
any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation  cause our sales to decline  require us to repair or replace the defective modules  and cause us to take voluntary remedial measures beyond warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition to our solar module warranty described above  for solar power plants built by our systems business  we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design  installation  and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant 
any widespread failures of solar power plants built by us could result in significant increases to warranty expense  damage our market reputation  cause our sales to decline  cause us to incur unexpected costs to remedy defects or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 
if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program are incorrect  we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 
we have historically pre funded  and will continue to pre fund in certain jurisdictions  our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules  which includes estimates for the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport  the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center  the material  labor  capital costs and scale of recycling centers  and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services 
we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty  and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the solar modules are expected to be collected and recycled 
if our estimates prove incorrect  we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or end users return their solar modules  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  participating end users can return their solar modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time 
as a result  we could be required to collect and recycle covered solar modules earlier than we expect 
our failure to further refine our technology  reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales  profitability  and or market share 
we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency  lower the levelized cost of electricity lcoe of our pv systems  and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry 
however  research and development activities are inherently uncertain  and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results 
we seek to continuously improve our products and processes  and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays  additional costs  or other unintended contingencies 
in addition  our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits 
other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies  including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon  which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more cost effective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems 
in addition  other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems  or offers other value added improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners  in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems 
as a result  our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors  which would reduce our net sales  profitability and or market share 
in addition  we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements  and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our conversion efficiency roadmap and our long term manufacturing cost  bos cost and lcoe reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods  and other technology is critical to our business 
failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies 
we rely primarily on patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property 
we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development  and are currently pursuing such patent applications in the us and worldwide 
our existing patents and future patents could be challenged  invalidated  circumvented  or rendered unenforceable 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  or if patents are issued to us  such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation  and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property  such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise 
adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise 
in addition  others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means 
the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  equipment  technology  trade secrets  and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods  and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations 
in some countries we have not applied for patent  trademark  or copyright protection 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive 
also  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor 
such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business 
an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business  prospects  and reputation 
in addition  we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 
some of our key raw materials and components are either single sourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 
our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality  quantity  and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost 
some of our key raw materials and components are either single sourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers 
as a result  the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations 
in addition  some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we continue to expand rapidly 
we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms 
a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity ramp plan and or our obligations under our customer contracts  which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 
a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride  our semiconductor material  could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and long term growth prospects 
a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound 
tellurium  one of the main components of cadmium telluride  is mainly produced as a by product of copper refining and  therefore  its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper 
our supply of cadmium telluride could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices 
if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride  supply could be reduced and prices could increase 
if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium  they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts 
we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts 
a substantial increase in tellurium prices could adversely impact our profitability and long term growth objectives 
our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and  when necessary  continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a cost effective manner  all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a cost effective and efficient manner 
if we cannot do so  we may be unable to expand our business  decrease our manufacturing cost per watt  maintain our competitive position  satisfy our contractual obligations  or sustain profitability 
see an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including the following making changes to our production process that are not properly qualified or that may cause problems with the quality of our solar modules  delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors  many of which may be beyond our control  such as our inability to secure successful contracts with equipment vendors  our custom built equipment taking longer and costing more to manufacture than expected and not operating as designed  delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities  being unable to hire qualified staff  failure to execute our expansion plans effectively  manufacturing concentration risk resulting from a majority of production lines worldwide being located in one geographic area  malaysia  difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner  potentially causing us to be manufacturing capacity constrained in some future periods or over supplied in others  and incurring manufacturing asset write downs  write offs and other charges and costs  which may be significant  during those periods in which we idle  slow down or shut down manufacturing capacity 
if any future production lines that we may build in the future are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans 
if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines  our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 
if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines  our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained  our manufacturing costs per watt could increase  and this may impair our growth plans and or cause us to lose customers  resulting in lower net sales  higher liabilities  and lower net income than we anticipate 
for instance  future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies  higher failure rates  and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines  and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 
some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced 
if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts  we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 
some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer  which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment 
as a result  the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working 
if any piece of equipment fails  production along the entire production line could be interrupted 
in addition  the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs  all of which would adversely impact our financial results 
if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt  our profitability could decline 
our profitability could decline if we are unable to continue to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt 
furthermore  our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 
we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 
we expect to continue to expand our business in order to provide utility scale pv generation to existing and new geographic markets and to maintain or increase market share 
to manage the continued expansion of our operations  we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  and expand  train  and manage our growing associate base 
our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers  suppliers  and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers 
in addition  our current and planned operations  personnel  systems  and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities  execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 
our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks  including unfavorable political  regulatory  labor  and tax conditions in foreign countries 
we have significant marketing  distribution  and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states 
we expect to continue to expand our operations into china  india  other countries in europe  asia  the middle east  and elsewhere  as a result  we will be subject to the legal  political  social  tax  and regulatory requirements  and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent to international operations  include  but are not limited to  the following difficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems  varying degrees of protection afforded to foreign investments in the countries in which we operate  and irregular interpretations and enforcement of laws and regulations in these jurisdictions  foreign countries may impose additional income and withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign operations  impose tariffs  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade and investment  including currency exchange controls  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect our profitability in us dollars to the extent the price of our solar modules and cost of raw materials  labor  and equipment is denominated in a foreign currency  inability to obtain  maintain  or enforce intellectual property rights  risk of nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises  changes in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate  including changes in the government incentives we are relying on  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements  including those with respect to environmental protection  export duties  and quotas  opaque approval processes in which the lack of transparency may cause delays and increase the uncertainty of project approvals  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  difficulty in repatriating earnings  difficulty in negotiating a successful collective bargaining agreement in applicable foreign jurisdictions  trade barriers such as export requirements  tariffs  taxes  local content requirements  anti dumping regulations and requirements  and other restrictions and expenses  which could increase the price of our solar modules and make us less competitive in some countries  and difficulty of  and costs relating to  compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas countries in which we offer and sell our solar modules 
our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries 
our overall success as a global business depends  in part  on our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social  and political conditions 
we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 
risks related to our systems business project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits  real property rights  power purchase agreements ppas  interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled  which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 
the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks 
we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights  preliminary engineering  permitting  legal  and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible  economically attractive  or capable of being built 
success in developing a particular project is contingent upon  among other things obtaining satisfactory land rights  including environmental mitigation lands  receipt from governmental agencies of required land use and construction permits and approvals  receipt of rights to interconnect the project to the electric grid or to transmit energy  payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are non refundable  negotiation of satisfactory engineering  procurement  and construction agreements  entering into financeable arrangements for the purchase of the electrical output and renewable energy attributes generated by the project  securing a project site and necessary rights of way  obtaining construction financing  including debt  equity and funds associated with the monetization of tax credits and other tax benefits  and timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction 
successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including delays in obtaining and maintaining required governmental permits and approvals  including appeals of approvals obtained  potential challenges from project stakeholders  including local residents  environmental organizations  and others who may not support the project  unforeseen engineering problems  construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls  work stoppages  cost over runs  labor  equipment and materials supply shortages or disruptions  additional complexities when conducting project development or construction activities in foreign jurisdictions either on a stand alone basis or in collaboration with local business partners  including operating in accordance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local laws and customs  unfavorable tax treatment  adverse weather conditions  adverse environmental and geological conditions  and force majeure and other events out of our control 
if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility  we fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates  any agreed upon system level capacity or energy output guarantees or warranties including  for some projects  twenty five year energy performance or system level module degradation warranties and guarantees  or other contract terms  or our projects cause grid interference or other damage  we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under power purchase agreements or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements  significant liquidated damages  penalties and or other obligations under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project including obligations to repair  replace and or supplement additional modules and balance of system materials for the project  particularly if our liabilities are not capped under the terms of such agreement  and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project 
some of these penalties might require us to repurchase the project from the buyer or to down size the project  under certain circumstances 
if we were required to repurchase a project  we may have insufficient cash or capital resources necessary to make the repurchase payment or we may be unable to resell the project in a timely manner or on terms commercially satisfactory to us  which would adversely impact our results of operations 
some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheet under the line item project assets 
if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project  we may write down or write off some or all of these capitalized investments  which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 
in  we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties  which may limit the availability of capital to use for other purposes  such as contract damages or repurchase payments 
we may enter into fixed price epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their solar power systems 
all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project  and these are reflected in the overall fixed price that we charge our customers for the project 
these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors  suppliers  and other parties to the project 
in addition  we require qualified  licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems 
shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs 
should miscalculations in planning a project occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation  commodity prices or labor costs or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price  we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 
we may be unable to acquire or lease land  obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights  and or obtain the approvals  licenses  permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner  and regulatory agencies  local communities  labor unions or other third parties may delay  prevent  or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 
in order to construct and operate our pv plants  we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way  obtain interconnection rights  and obtain all necessary local  county  state  federal  and foreign approvals  licenses  and permits as well as rights to interconnect the plants to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the plant 
we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed  may not obtain satisfactory interconnection rights  may not receive or retain the requisite approvals  permits  licenses and interconnection and transmission rights  or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants 
many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and right of way procedures and processes 
the authorization for the use  construction  and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal  state  and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights  private rights of way  and other easements  environmental  agricultural  cultural  recreational  and aesthetic impacts  and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses 
the inability to obtain the required permits and  potentially  excessive delay in obtaining such permits due  for example  to litigation or third party appeals  could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants in a timely manner and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project 
moreover  project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions  including mitigation requirements and costs  could affect the financial success of a given project 
in addition  local labor unions may increase the cost of  and or lower the productivity of  project development in canada  california  and elsewhere 
we may also be subject to labor unavailability and or increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 
lack of transmission capacity availability  potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid  and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 
in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers  our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid 
the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size  delays in project implementation  increases in costs from transmission upgrades  and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project 
these transmission issues  as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear  could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 
our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 
the construction of the large utility scale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing  including non recourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets 
uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction 
if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan 
in addition  we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented  strategic industry  and other equity investors 
such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts  in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business  financial condition  or results of operations may be adversely affected 
even if such financing sources are available  the counterparty to many of our fixed price epc contracts  which own the project we are constructing  are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the project related debt and certain other sources of financing 
if the owner defaults on its payment or other obligations to us  we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of pv modules  or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract 
if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us  or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default  we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project  which could result in a material loss 
in addition  for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer  our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their pv plant projects  which  in turn  is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases on acceptable terms 
depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets  interest rates and other factors  such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 
if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant construction services from us  we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales  and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business and or generate revenue 
see also the risk factor above entitled an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for end users to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules and or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 
developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our solar power project development cycles  which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project  vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature 
as a result of these long project cycles  we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including  for example  payments for land rights  large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments  which may be non refundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts and commencing construction and the receipt of any revenue  much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing 
our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
furthermore  we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 
our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing  terms and timing commercially acceptable to us 
we may not be able to obtain long term contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments 
obtaining long term contracts for the sale of power produced by the projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects 
we must compete for power purchase agreements against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects 
further  other sources of power  such as natural gas fired power plants  have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and power from certain types of projects  such as natural gas fired power plants  can be delivered on a firm basis 
the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue 
in addition  the availability of power purchase agreements is a function of a number of economic  regulatory  tax and public policy factors 
we may be subject to unforeseen costs  liabilities or obligations when providing o m services 
for solar power plants which we have developed and built  we may provide ongoing o m services to the system owner under fixed price long term service agreements  pursuant to which we generally perform all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for the system  perform operating and other asset management services for the system and provide an availability guarantee for the system 
our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the o m agreement for a particular project  and these are reflected in the fixed price that we charge our customers under the o m agreement 
we do not have extensive experience in performing o m services for pv solar power plants and estimating actual costs to serve under our o m agreements relative to the price that we charge our customers  particularly in foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to offer pv systems solutions as part of our long term strategic plan 
should miscalculations in estimating these costs occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or labor or bos costs  our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because of the long term nature of these o m agreements  such as years  such adverse impacts on results of operations could be significant  particularly if our liabilities are not capped or subject to an above market liability cap under the terms of the o m agreement 
we also could be subject to substantial costs  liabilities or obligations in the event our solar systems do not meet any agreed upon system level availability or performance warranties 
other risks we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions  and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
we have made several acquisitions in the last several years  and in the future we may acquire additional companies  project pipelines  products  or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks 
these risks include the following difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures  and policies during the transition and integration  disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and associates from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues  difficulty integrating the acquired company s accounting  management information  and other administrative systems  inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business  inability to retain key customers  vendors  and other business partners of the acquired business  inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  as a result of insufficient capital resources or otherwise  incurring acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results  potential impairment of our relationships with our associates  customers  partners  distributors  or third party providers of technology or products  potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality  legal and financial liabilities  among other things  potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective  potential inability to obtain  or obtain in a timely manner  approvals from governmental authorities  which could delay or prevent such acquisitions  and potential delay in customer purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings 
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky  and ultimately  if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 
we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team 
the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates  and we may not have adequate succession plans in place 
several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain post employment non competition provisions 
however  these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the non competition provisions is uncertain 
if we are unable to attract  train  and retain key personnel  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  on our ability to attract  train  and retain management  operations  and technical personnel  including in foreign jurisdictions as we continue to execute on our long term strategic plan 
recruiting and retaining capable personnel  particularly those with expertise in the pv industry and thin film technology  are vital to our success 
there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates  or otherwise experience labor disruptions our business may be materially and adversely affected 
certain types of services provided by onsite workers at certain of our solar projects under construction are subject to the davis bacon act 
the davis bacon act requires that a contractor pay all personnel assigned to the contract at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits  as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the us department of labor dol 
we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davis bacon act requirements and ensure our compliance with these requirements 
if the dol were to ultimately determine that anyone working under such contracts were not properly classified  or were being paid the incorrect prevailing wage  we could incur additional liability with respect to such workers 
for example  the agua caliente project we are constructing is currently undergoing a dol davis bacon act compliance review  for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain 
any such liability incurred above our anticipated costs for these services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties  which  if determined adversely to us  could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 
our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and know how without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents involve complex scientific  legal  and factual considerations and analysis and  therefore  may be highly uncertain 
we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  patent opposition proceedings  and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or pay ongoing royalties  require us to redesign our solar module  or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies 
protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 
currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales  cost of sales  and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 
although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk 
for example  and of our net sales were denominated in euros for the years ended december  and december   respectively  and we expect more than a minor percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future 
in addition  our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the us and our operations for our systems business in foreign countries will generally be denominated in the local currency 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses 
we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 
we could also expand our business into emerging markets  many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy 
conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 
our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us 
deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure  and therefore  result in exchange gains or losses 
the ongoing sovereign debt problems in europe could adversely impact our business 
the ongoing sovereign debt problems in europe and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of european banks in particular could negatively impact our access to  and cost of  capital  and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and competitive position 
it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems business as well 
the european sovereign debt problems may also cause european governments to reduce  eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy  which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are subject to litigation risks  including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions  which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
from time to time  we are subject to legal claims  with and without merit  that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
moreover  many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek  and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us 
certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that  if resolved against us  could give rise to substantial damages  and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits  or any future lawsuits  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
even if these lawsuits  or any future lawsuits  are not resolved against us  the costs of defending such lawsuits  may be costly  and may not be covered by our insurance policies 
because the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future

our largest stockholder has significant control over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 
our largest stockholder  consisting collectively of jcl fslr holdings  llc and its beneficiaries and jtw trust no 
uad and its beneficiaries  each affiliated in the past with the former estate of john t 
walton collectively  the significant stockholder  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock at december  as a result  the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers  tender offers  and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 
for example  the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay  defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger  takeover  or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 
if our goodwill or project assets become impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill or project assets are impaired 
such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for example  during the fourth quarter of we recorded goodwill impairment expense of million related to our components reporting unit as discussed further in note goodwill and intangible assets  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
as required by accounting rules  we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry 
we review project assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be sellable for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed 
if our projects are not considered commercially viable  we would be required to impair the respective project assets 
unanticipated changes in our tax provisions  the adoption of a new us tax legislation  or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory  services  licenses  funding  and other items in inter company transactions 
we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions 
tax authorities may disagree with our inter company charges  cross jurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes 
we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision in accordance with asc  income taxes 
however  there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations  and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore  could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income  and cash flows 
in addition  our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure  loss of our malaysian tax holiday  changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws  and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process 
in addition  recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation could have a material effect on the results of our operations  if enacted 
our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions  engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us  and obtain additional financing  if needed  because our revolving credit facility and our malaysian facility agreements contain  and any of our other future debt agreements may contain  covenant restrictions that limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  assume obligations in connection with letters of credit  or issue guarantees  create liens  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  sell certain assets  and declare or pay dividends  make other distributions to stockholders  or make other restricted payments 
under our revolving credit facility and our malaysian facility agreements  we are also subject to certain financial covenants 
our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements  which if not cured or waived  could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause cross defaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such other facility agreements  as well as cross defaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements 
in addition  we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company  or in the industry or the economy as a whole  will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements 
if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred  the lenders can  under certain circumstances  restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding loan balances 
if any of our debt is accelerated  we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt  and we may experience cross defaults under our other debt agreements or project and key operational agreements  which could materially and negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

overview we are a premium global provider of solar energy solutions 
we manufacture and sell photovoltaic pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology  and we design  construct  and sell pv solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture 
we are the world s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world s largest pv solar module manufacturers 
in addressing overall global demand for pv solar electricity  we have developed a differentiated  fully integrated systems business that can provide a competitively priced turn key utility scale pv system solution for system owners and competitively priced electricity to utility end users 
our fully integrated systems business  which uses the solar modules we manufacture  has enabled us to increase module throughput  drive cost reduction across the value chain  identify and break constraints to sustainable markets  and deliver compelling solutions to our customers and end users 
with our fully integrated systems business  we believe we are in a position to expand our business in economically sustainable markets in which support programs are minimal  which are developing in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand 
we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity  and in the long term  we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuel based peaking power generation 
in furtherance of our goal of delivering affordable solar electricity  we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing  balance of systems bos costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules  such as inverters  mounting hardware  trackers  grid interconnection equipment  wiring and other devices  and installation labor costs  project development costs  and the cost of capital 
first  with respect to our module manufacturing costs  our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world for modules produced on a commercial scale  based on publicly available information 
in  our total average manufacturing costs were per watt  which is competitive on a comparable basis with those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers  based on publicly available information 
by continuing to improve conversion efficiency  production line throughput  and lower material costs  we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain cost competitiveness with traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 
second  with respect to our bos cost reduction roadmap  we have aggressive programs which target key improvements in components and system design  which when combined with continued improvements in conversion efficiency  volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms  use of innovative installation techniques and know how  and accelerated installation times  are expected to result in substantial reductions to our bos costs enabling a lower system levelized cost of energy 
third  with respect to our project development costs  we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs  and to accelerate lead times to electricity generation 
finally  with respect to the cost of capital  by continuing to demonstrate the financial viability and operational performance of our utility scale pv solar power plants and increasing our pv solar power system operating experience  we believe we can continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our pv solar power systems  thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 
we believe that combining our reliable  low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity  accelerate the adoption of our technology in utility scale pv solar power systems  and identify and remove constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets around the world 
our vertically integrated capabilities enable us to maximize value and mitigate risk for our customers and thereby deliver meaningful pv energy solutions to varied energy problems worldwide 
we offer leadership across the entire solar value chain  resulting in more reliable and cost effective pv energy solutions for our customers  and furthering our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean  affordable solar electricity 
we operate our business in two segments 
our components segment involves the design  manufacture  and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 
third party customers of our components segment include project developers  system integrators  and operators of renewable energy projects 
our second segment is our fully integrated systems business systems segment  through which we provide complete turn key pv solar power systems  or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities  which include i project development  ii engineering  procurement  and construction epc services  iii operating and maintenance o m services  and iv project finance expertise  all as described in more detail below 
we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity 
all of our systems segment products and services are for pv solar power systems which use our solar modules  and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities  independent power developers and producers  commercial and industrial companies  and other system owners 
market overview the solar industry experienced a challenging environment in  categorized by intense pricing competition  both at the pv module and system level  with many solar companies generating little or no operating income 
in the aggregate  manufacturers of solar modules and cells have installed production capacity that significantly exceeds global demand 
we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie  where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand may continue for the foreseeable future  and we expect it will continue to put pressure on pricing and our results of operations in we further believe that this structural imbalance will remain unfavorable for solar companies that are primarily module manufacturers  but that companies with established expertise and meaningful solutions in other areas of the solar value chain  such as project development  epc capabilities  and o m services  are more likely to develop economically sustainable businesses 
in light of such market realities  we continue to execute on our long term strategic plan described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths 
a key core strength is our differentiated vertically integrated business model that enables us to provide utility scale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for mass scale pv electricity 
the development of solar markets worldwide continued throughout  in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices  both at the pv module and system level  which makes solar power more affordable to new markets  and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in these markets 
in the united arab emirates  we announced in october that we were selected by the dubai electricity water authority dewa to construct a mw ac pv power plant near dubai 
in india  we announced in october the entry into an agreement to supply first solar modules to two pv power plants totaling mw dc to be constructed in india s rajasthan state 
in australia  first solar  verve energy and ge energy financial services officially began commercial operation in october of a first solar built mw ac plant that will help power the southern seawater desalination plant in western australia 
in china  we announced in september the appointment of a country head to lead business development in china  with responsibility for expanding the market for utility scale solar pv power plants using our modules in that country  and in december we announced a collaboration with zhenfa new energy science technology co  ltd 
to supply mw of our modules in to one of zhenfa s approved solar projects in china as part of our first commercial demonstration project in china 
in thailand  we announced in august the establishment of a thai operating subsidiary and the opening of an office in bangkok to enable first solar to execute its strategy and pursue opportunities for utility scale pv power plants in the local market 
in south africa  we announced in december the appointment of a director of business development for sub saharan africa in our newly established office in cape town 
in chile  we announced in january our acquisition of solar chile  a santiago based solar development company with a portfolio of early to mid stage utility scale pv power projects totaling approximately gw in northern chile  including the atacama desert region  which offers among the highest solar irradiance in the world 
in north america  we continue to execute on our advance stage utility scale systems pipeline 
we continue to make construction progress on what will be among the world s four largest solar pv power plants the mw ac topaz solar farm  located in san luis obispo county  california  the mw ac desert sunlight solar farm  located west of blythe  california  the mw ac agua caliente project in yuma county  arizona  and the mw ac antelope valley solar ranch one project avsr  located just north of los angeles  california 
the agua caliente project is currently the largest operating pv power plant in the world and has achieved a peak generating capacity of more than mw ac while connected to the electrical grid 
we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales  operating income and cash flows through to be derived from these four projects 
we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advanced stage systems pipeline and we continue to evaluate additions to such pipeline 
in september  we announced execution of power purchase agreements with pacific gas and electric company pg e for mw ac of solar electricity to be generated at two pv power plants that first solar is developing in central california the mw ac lost hills project in kern county and the mw ac cuyama project in santa barbara county 
in september  we also announced the entry into agreements to construct four solar power plants totaling up to mw ac in new mexico for pnm resources  inc in january  we announced that we started constructing the mw ac campo verde solar project  located near el centro in imperial county  california 
we also announced in january our acquisition of the mw ac macho springs solar project in luna county  new mexico  which will be the state s largest solar power project when completed 
in  industry average module pricing continued to decline as competitors reduced prices to sell through inventories worldwide 
lower industry module pricing  while currently challenging for solar manufacturers particularly manufacturers with high cost structures  is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity 
over time  declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration  its affordability 
in the near term  however  in light of industry wide manufacturing capacity that exceeds demand  it is uncertain whether growing worldwide demand can absorb industry wide module supply without further inventory build up and or price reductions  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if competitors reduce module pricing to levels below their manufacturing costs  or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time  our results of operations could be further adversely affected 
we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our utility scale systems pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations  accelerating our module efficiency improvements and cost reduction roadmaps to maintain and increase our competitiveness  profitability and capital efficiency  adjusting our production plans and capacity utilization to match our expected demand  and continuing the development of worldwide geographic markets  including those in india  australia  the middle east  latin america  and china 
in the components business  we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems 
solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes  including reliability and selling price per watt  and  with respect to solar power systems  return on equity roe and levelized cost of electricity lcoe  meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system s life 
we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry  based on publicly available information 
this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their roe or lcoe 
our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process  as opposed to a batch process  our scale  and our operational excellence 
in addition  our modules use approximately of the amount of semiconductor material ie  silicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 
the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules  and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels 
polysilicon costs have declined over the past several years  contributing to a decline in our manufacturing cost competitiveness over crystalline silicon module manufacturers 
given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to many types of crystalline silicon modules  there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules 
thus  to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe  our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon based modules with higher conversion efficiencies 
we continue to reduce bos costs associated with systems using our modules 
we believe we can continue to reduce bos costs by improving conversion efficiency  leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms  using innovative installation techniques and know how  and accelerating installation times 
bos costs can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility scale pv solar power system 
while our modules are currently competing in these product performance attributes  there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all 
any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression  further declines in the average selling prices of our solar modules  erosion in our market share for modules  decreases in the rate of net sales growth  and or declines in overall net sales 
we have taken  and continue to take  various actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures  including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary  accelerating progress along our module and bos cost reduction roadmaps  and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 
as we continue to expand our systems business into sustainable markets  we can offer value beyond the solar module  reduce our exposure to module only competition  provide differentiated product offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization  and provide comprehensive utility scale pv systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs 
thus  our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules 
finally  we continue to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers around the world and continue to develop our range of product offerings  including epc capabilities and o m services  in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules 
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors in part i  item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
long term strategic plan in may  we provided information regarding our long term strategic plan long term strategic plan or ltsp to transition to primarily sustainable opportunities by the end of in executing the ltsp we are focusing on providing solar pv generation solutions using our modules to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for mass scale pv electricity  including markets throughout the americas  asia  the middle east  and africa 
as part of our ltsp  we are focusing on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions will compete over time directly with fossil fuel offerings on a levelized cost of energy basis 
execution of the ltsp will entail a reallocation of resources around the globe  in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america  asia  the middle east  and africa where we have not traditionally conducted significant business to date 
we will evaluate and manage closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets 
we intend to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation  to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions  and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific region 
we expect that  over time  an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales  operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the sustainable markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan  and that  over time  larger relative contributions to our overall financial performance may come from systems offerings in comparison to module only sales 
the timing  execution and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties  as described in the risk factors in part i  item a and elsewhere in this report 
we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least cost  best fit energy solution  particularly in regions with high solar resources  significant current or projected electricity demand and or relatively high existing electricity prices 
as part of these efforts  we are expanding resources globally  including by appointing country heads and supporting professional  sales and other staff in target markets 
accordingly we expect to shift current costs and incur additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these regions 
we expect joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners to be a key part of our strategy  and we have begun initiatives in several markets to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential customers and policymakers 
some of these business arrangements are expected to involve investments or other allocations of capital on our part 
we are in the process of developing relationships with policymakers  regulators  and especially end customers in each of these markets with a view to creating markets for utility scale pv solar power systems 
we sell solar power solutions that include our modules directly to end customers  including independent power producers  utilities  retail electric providers and commercial and industrial customers 
depending on the market opportunity  our sales offerings range from third party module only sales  to module sales with a range of engineering  procurement and construction products and solutions  to full turn key solar power system sales 
we expect these sales offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar power solutions can best meet our customers energy and economic needs 
in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets our offerings from time to time may need to be priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time  and possibly vary from our internal long range profitability expectations and targets  depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offering compared with other energy solutions  fossil fuel based or otherwise  that are available to potential customers 
construction of some of the world s largest solar pv power plants we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales  operating income and cash flows through to be derived from the following four projects in north america  which will be among the world s four largest solar pv power plants the mw ac topaz solar farm  located in san luis obispo county  california  the mw ac desert sunlight solar farm  located west of blythe  california  the mw ac agua caliente project located in yuma county  arizona  and the mw ac avsr project  located just north of los angeles  california 
please see the tables under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial operations overview net sales systems business for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advanced stage project pipeline 
construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in the risk factors in part i  item a and elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition for these projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been or will be met  and consequently period over period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful 
as we progress towards substantial completion of our four largest pv power plants under construction  which is expected to occur in through  we expect to have a larger portion of our net sales  operating income and cash flows come from future sales of solar offerings outside of north america  pursuant to our long term strategic plan described above 
north america however  will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales  operating income and cash flows as a significant portion of our advance stage project pipeline  after excluding the four projects above  is comprised of projects in north america 
manufacturing capacity as of december   we had installed production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately gw at our manufacturing plants in perrysburg  ohio  and kulim  malaysia 
our manufacturing operations in frankfurt oder  germany closed at the end of production at one or more of our manufacturing plants has and may in the future be idled temporarily to better align production with expected market demand and to allow us to implement upgraded process technologies as part of our conversion efficiency improvement initiatives 
manufacturing excursion during the period from june to june  a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field 
the root cause of the manufacturing excursion was identified and addressed in june beginning in  we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard limited warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules manufactured during the relevant period that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts 
these remediation efforts included module removal  replacement and logistical services and additional compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances 
our best estimate for costs of our voluntary remediation program  as of and in each fiscal period in question  has been based on evaluation and consideration of the then currently available information  including the estimated number of affected modules in the field  historical experience related to our voluntary remediation efforts  customer provided data related to potentially affected systems and the estimated costs of performing the logistical services covered under our remediation program 
as we continued remediation efforts under our voluntary remediation program  we learned that  in light of the impracticality of identifying and replacing individual affected models  in order to remediate the energy loss impact at a system level  we are required to remove and replace several modules in the aggregate  including modules that might not have been affected by the manufacturing excursion 
removed modules are returned to us and are further tested to determine if the module can be resold or whether the module should be recycled 
we have expensed million total through december  for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period  including million for remediation expenses beyond our limited warranty obligations and million in product warranty expense reflecting the net increase in the expected number of replacement modules required in connection with our remediation efforts 
as part of our overall remediation strategy  we have reached commercial settlements with impacted customers mostly during the fourth quarter of and we expect to reach additional commercial settlements in the future 
such commercial settlements typically include us making a cash payment to a customer in lieu of actually remediating the customer s affected sites and in exchange the customer agrees that no further claims against us related to the manufacturing excursion can be made 
the commercial settlements are beneficial to our customers as they benefit from a timely and fair settlement of their claims and we are able to eliminate the risk of uncertainty related to the ultimate cost of actual remediation efforts associated with identifying and replacing individual modules 
for additional information regarding accrued expenses in excess of normal product warranty liability and related expenses  see note consolidated balance sheet details  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our voluntary remediation program  and the related manufacturing excursion  also resulted in changes in estimates to our product warranty liability 
for additional information regarding these changes  see note commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
restructuring we have undertaken a series of restructuring initiatives as further described in note restructuring  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in december  february and april  respectively  we announced restructuring initiatives intended to i align the organization with our long term strategic plan  including expected sustainable market opportunities  ii accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency  and iii better align production capacity and geographic location of such capacity with expected geographic market requirements and demand 
such restructuring initiatives resulted in charges to restructuring expense of million in and million in the most significant actions taken as part of these restructuring activities were the decisions to close our manufacturing operations in frankfurt oder  germany at the end of due to the lack of policy support for utility scale solar projects in europe and to not proceed with our line manufacturing plant in vietnam or a line manufacturing plant in france  based upon expected future market demand and our focus on providing utility scale pv generation solutions primarily to sustainable geographic markets 
the annual cost savings expected from these restructuring initiatives in and beyond are expected to be between million and million  reducing both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses in approximately equal amounts 
the amount of cost savings realized will in part be impacted by the actual capacity utilization in a given year 
these cost savings may be offset by increases in operating expenses primarily related to establishing a localized business presence in target markets pursuant to our long term strategic plan 
system level module performance warranty as an alternative to our module power output warranty  we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales 
this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides year plant level energy degradation protection 
the system level module performance warranty is calculated as a percentage of a system s expected energy production  adjusted for certain actual site conditions  with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion  but never falling below during the term of the warranty 
in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels  we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance  then we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing modules  providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment 
consistent with our module power output warranty  when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the systems level module performance warranty  we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 
currently  only a small percentage of our systems projects are subject to such system level module performance warranty  but we expect that this percentage will increase in the future as we extend it to future systems sales arrangements 
we do not anticipate that the system level module performance warranty will have a material impact on our future warranty claim rates  as such warranty is designed to be in line with the expected risk adjusted aggregate performance of our modules 
the offering of such system level warranty addresses the challenge of identifying  from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility scale system  individual modules that are performing below warranty by focusing on the energy generated by the system rather than the capacity of individual modules 
financial operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 
net sales components business we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of name plate power 
during  the substantial majority of net sales from the components business was related to modules included in our solar systems described below under net sales systems business 
other than the modules included in our solar power systems  we sold the majority of our solar modules to solar power system project developers  system integrators  and operators headquartered in the united states  germany  france and india  which either resell our solar modules to end users or most integrate them into power plants that they own  operate  or sell 
during  most of our supply contracts for the sale of solar modules with certain solar power system project developers and system integrators headquartered within the european union eu supply contracts  were terminated upon mutual consent or expired under their terms 
the committed volumes we expect to sell under our remaining eu supply contracts are expected to be a minor portion of our consolidated net sales 
we have also entered into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules 
such agreements are generally not long term in nature 
during the year ended december   of our components segment s net sales were denominated in euros and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 
third party module sales represented approximately of our total net sales 
under our typical customer sales contracts for solar modules  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment 
pricing is typically fixed at the time of shipment and our customers do not typically have extended payment terms 
customers do not have rights of return under these contracts 
our revenue recognition policies for the components business is described further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
during  nrg energy  inc  exelon corporation  and midamerican renewables  llc individually accounted for more than of our components segment s net sales  which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects 
each of the above customers also represented more than of our consolidated net sales 
systems business through our fully integrated systems business  we provide a complete turn key solar power system solution using our solar modules  which may include project development  epc services  o m services  and project finance expertise 
net sales from our systems segment may include the following types of transactions transaction description engineer and procure ep contract design for a customer of a solar electricity generation system that uses our solar modules  includes the procurement of some or all bos components from third party suppliers 
engineer  procure  and construct epc contract design and construction for a customer of a turn key solar electricity generation system that uses our solar modules  includes the procurement of all bos components from third party suppliers 
sale of project assets sale of project assets to a customer at various stages of development 
this generally includes a single project consisting of costs incurred for permits  land or land rights  and or power purchase agreements 
operating and maintenance o m agreement typically a fixed price long term services agreement to operate and maintain a solar electricity generating system that we built 
net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors  including the competitiveness of our systems offerings in comparison to our competitors solar systems and other forms of electricity generation  the magnitude and effectiveness of support programs  and other solar power system demand drivers 
during and  the majority of our systems segment net sales were generated in north america 
net sales from our systems business during resulted primarily from solar power projects in north america and europe 
during  the principal customers of our systems segment were nrg energy  inc  exelon corporation  and midamerican renewables  llc  each of which also accounted for more than of our total net sales during we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models  following the guidance in asc  accounting for long term construction contracts or  for arrangements which include land or land rights  asc  accounting for sales of real estate 
our revenue recognition policies for the systems business is described further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
for systems business sales arrangements that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc  we use the percentage of completion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project including module costs as our standard accounting policy  unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract  in which case we would use the completed contract method 
for systems business sales arrangements that are accounted for under asc where we have gained control of land or land rights  we record the sale as revenue only after all revenue recognition criteria have been met  typically using either the percentage of completion method or once construction of a project is substantially complete 
revenue recognition for our systems projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met  and consequently period over period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful 
systems project pipeline the following tables summarize  as of february   our approximately gw ac systems business advanced project pipeline 
as of december   for the projects sold under contract in our project pipeline of approximately gw ac  we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately mw ac 
such mw ac equivalent amount refers to the ratio of revenue recognized for the projects sold under contract in our project pipeline compared to total contracted revenue for such projects  multiplied by the total mw ac for such projects 
the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december  for the projects sold under contract in our project pipeline is expected to be approximately billion 
the substantial majority of such amount is expected to be recognized as revenue through the substantial completion dates of the projects sold under contract 
the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects sold under contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met including timing of module installation 
projects are removed from our project pipeline tables below once we have completed construction and after substantially all revenue has been recognized

our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering  equipment maintenance  environmental health and safety  quality and production control  and procurement costs 
cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses 
in addition  we accrue shipping  warranty and any obligation for solar module collection and recycling costs within cost of sales 
our manufacturing cost per watt  which is an operating metric we use as an indicator of manufacturing cost competitiveness  represents the current manufacturing and associated costs incurred to produce and sell solar modules during a period divided by the number of salable watts produced in the same period 
for fiscal periods beginning in  our cost per watt will exclude any costs associated with our manufacturing plants in frankfurt oder  germany  which closed manufacturing operations at the end of overall  we expect our cost per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase in watts per solar module  an increase in unit output per production line  and ongoing reductions in variable and fixed costs 
this expected decrease in cost per watt would be partially offset during periods in which we underutilize manufacturing capacity 
systems business within our systems business  project related costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters  electrical and mounting hardware  project management and engineering costs  and installation labor costs  site specific costs  and development costs including transmission upgrade costs  interconnection fees  and permitting costs 
as further described in note segment and geographical information  to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form k  at the time when all revenue recognition criteria are met  we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business 
therefore  the related cost of sales are also included within our components business at that time 
the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured inventory cost incurred by our components segment 
gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors  including our module and system average selling prices  market demand  market mix  our manufacturing costs  bos costs  project development costs  the effective utilization of our production facilities  and foreign exchange rates 
gross profit is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses 
gross profit for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules  which we include in the gross profit of our components business 
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs  the cost of products  materials  and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities for both the components and systems businesses 
we acquire equipment for general use in our process and product development and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense 
currently  the substantial majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment 
we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv systems using our modules 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  travel expenses  and other selling expenses 
we expect selling  general and administrative expense to decline over time as we reduce operating costs in connection with our restructuring activities  which is a component of our long term strategic plan 
our systems business has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions  such as accounting  legal  finance  project finance  human resources  procurement  and marketing 
costs for these functions are recorded and included within selling  general and administrative costs for our systems segment 
our corporate key functions consist primarily of company wide corporate tax  corporate treasury  corporate accounting finance  corporate legal  investor relations  corporate communications  and executive management functions 
these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments 
we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling  general and administrative costs  based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions 
we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling  general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations 
production start up production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production  including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase 
it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs  and the costs to maintain our plant replication program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
in general  we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility  primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 
production start up expense is attributable to our components segment 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we determined that goodwill related to our components segment was impaired and recorded expense of million 
during and  we had no goodwill impairments 
restructuring we have undertaken a series of restructuring initiatives as further described in note restructuring  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in december  february and april  respectively  we announced restructuring initiatives intended to i align the organization with our long term strategic plan  including expected sustainable market opportunities  ii accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency  and iii better align production capacity and geographic location of such capacity with expected geographic market requirements and demand 
such restructuring initiatives resulted in charges to restructuring expense of million in and million in the most significant actions taken as part of these restructuring activities were the decisions to close our manufacturing operations in frankfurt oder  germany at the end of due to the lack of policy support for utility scale solar projects in europe and to not proceed with our line manufacturing plant in vietnam or a line manufacturing plant in france  based upon expected future market demand and our focus on providing utility scale pv generation solutions primarily to sustainable geographic markets 
the annual cost savings expected from these restructuring initiatives in and beyond are expected to be between million and million  reducing both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses in approximately equal amounts 
the amount of cost savings realized will in part be impacted by the actual capacity utilization in a given year 
these cost savings may be offset by increases in operating expenses primarily related to establishing a localized business presence in target markets pursuant to our long term strategic plan 
foreign currency gain loss foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
interest income interest income is earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash and investments 
interest income also includes interest received from notes receivable and interest collected for late customer payments 
interest expense  net interest expense is incurred on various debt financings 
we capitalize interest expense into our property  plant and equipment  or project assets when such costs qualify for interest capitalization  reducing the amount of interest expense reported in any given reporting period 
other income expense  net other income expense is primarily comprised of changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts and realized gains losses on the sale of fixed income investments 
income tax expense income taxes are imposed on our income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  principally the united states  germany  and malaysia 
the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is  while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately and  respectively 
in malaysia  we have been granted a long term tax holiday  scheduled to expire in  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience  our forecasts  and other available information  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
our critical accounting estimates  which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  are as follows revenue recognition percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models  following the guidance in asc  accounting for long term construction contracts or  for arrangements which include land or land rights  asc  accounting for sales of real estate 
for systems business sales arrangements that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc  we use the percentage of completion method as our standard accounting policy  unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract  in which case we would use the completed contract method 
we also apply the percentage of completion method to certain sales arrangements covered under asc only after a sale has been consummated  we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer  the initial and continuing investment criteria have been met  we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion  and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in applying the percentage of completion method we use the actual costs incurred relative to estimated costs to complete including modules in order to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize 
incurred costs include all installed direct materials  installed solar modules  labor  subcontractor costs  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and tools 
we recognize direct material and solar module costs as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed in the project 
when contracts specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed  we will not recognize revenue or associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements 
we consider direct materials and solar modules to be installed when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by engineering designs 
solar modules that will be used in our solar power systems  which we still hold title to  remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a solar power system 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete our projects 
in making such estimates  management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions such as the cost of materials and labor  expected labor productivity  the impact of potential variances in schedule completion  the amount of net contract revenues and the impact of any penalties  claims  change orders  or performance incentives 
if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the contract revenues  we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known 
the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to contract revenues and costs to complete contracts  including penalties  incentive awards  claims  change orders  anticipated losses and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contract or the adjustment 
accrued solar module collection and recycling liability 
at the time of sale  we recognize an expense for the estimated cost of our future obligation for collecting and recycling solar modules sold that are covered by our collection and recycling program 
we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules  which includes estimates for the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport  the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center  the material  labor  capital costs and scale of recycling centers  and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services 
we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes  about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled  and about the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling 
in the periods between the time of our sales and the settlement of our collection and recycling obligations  we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed an annual cost study and updated our estimates for the expected future collection and recycling costs and we adjusted our module collection and recycling liability accordingly 
at december   our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was million 
a change in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would change this estimated liability by million 
product warranties and manufacturing excursions 
we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also typically warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least of their labeled power output rating during the first years following their installation and at least of their labeled power output rating during the following years 
in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties  we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or  under the power output warranty  providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall 
we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price for solar modules to resolve claims 
our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 
as an alternative to our module power output warranty  we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales 
this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides year plant level energy degradation protection 
the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system s expected energy production  adjusted for certain actual site conditions  with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion  but never falling below during the term of the warranty 
in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels  we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance  then we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing modules  providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment 
consistent with our module power output warranty  when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplement modules under the system level module performance warranty  we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 
in addition to our solar module warranty described above  for solar power plants built by our systems business  we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design  installation  and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant 
in resolving claims under the engineering design  installation  and workmanship warranties  we have the option of remedying the defect through repair  or replacement 
when we recognize revenue for module or systems project sales  we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations 
we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations  our experience with warranty claims  our monitoring of field installation sites  our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components  and our estimated per module replacement cost 
such estimates have changed  and may in the future change  based primarily upon historical experience including additional information received from the evaluation of warranty claims and the complete processing of such claims 
we also make an estimate for the costs of any voluntary remediation programs including our manufacturing excursion 
our estimate for remediation costs for our manufacturing excursion is based on evaluation and consideration of currently available information  including the estimated number of affected modules in the field  historical experience related to our remediation efforts  customer provided data related to potentially affected systems  the estimated costs of performing any remediation services  and the post sale expenses covered under our remediation program 
from time to time  we have taken remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty  and we may elect to do so in the future  in which case we would incur additional expenses that are beyond our limited warranty 
if we commit to any such remediation actions beyond our limited warranty  developing our estimates for such remediation actions may require significant management judgment 
at december   our accrued liability for product warranty was million 
we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately of modules covered under warranty 
a percentage point change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately million 
accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with asc  income taxes 
once established  we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim  tax assessment  or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities  if any 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period  we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
conversely  to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary  that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed  which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 
we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
we have concluded that  except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income  all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states 
if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes  additional taxes may be required to be accrued 
see note income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
long lived asset impairment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified 
we review our long lived assets each reporting period to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event indicating potential impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for long lived assets  when impairment indicators are present  we compare undiscounted future cash flows  including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value  to the asset group s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable 
this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used 
assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization  including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing of placing this capacity back into production 
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above  the estimated fair value of long lived assets may be determined using an income approach  market approach  cost approach  or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed 
all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets 
if there is an impairment  a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset groups fair value and carrying value prior to impairment 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows  relevant discount rates  and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
our estimates are based upon historical experience  our commercial relationships  and available information about future trends 
we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market changes and the corresponding impact on volume and average selling prices and that these are more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions 
we believe our current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we do not amortize goodwill  but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and  if necessary  we would record any impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
we will perform an impairment test between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the qualitative impairment test includes considering various factors including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  cost factors  a sustained share price or market capitalization decrease  and any reporting unit specific events 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the two step impairment test is not required 
if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is not greater than its carrying value  we must perform the two step impairment test 
we may also elect to proceed directly to the two step impairment test without considering such qualitative factors 
the first step in a two step impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our two reporting units are the components and systems reporting units  which are the same as our reportable segments 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements  we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation  which includes the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach methodology of valuation  which considers values of comparable businesses to estimate the fair values of our reporting units 
we do not believe that a cost approach is relevant to measuring the fair values of our reporting units 
significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results  the discount rates and expected future growth rates that we use in the discounted cash flow method of valuation  and in the selection of comparable businesses that we use in the market approach 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required 
if the carrying value assigned to a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step  then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
in this step  we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
if there is no such excess then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired 
reportable segment allocations 
asc  segment reporting  establishes standards for companies to report in their financial statements information about operating segments  products  services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the method of determining what information to report is generally based on the way that management organizes the operating segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 
we operate our business in two segments 
our components segment involves the design  manufacture  and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 
third party customers of our components segment include project developers  system integrators  and operators of renewable energy projects 
our second segment is our fully integrated systems business systems segment  through which we provide complete turn key pv solar power systems  or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities  which include i project development  ii engineering  procurement  and construction epc services  iii operating and maintenance o m services  and iv project finance expertise 
we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity 
all of our systems segment products and services are for pv solar power systems which use our solar modules  and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities  independent power developers and producers  commercial and industrial companies  and other system owners 
in our operating segment financial disclosures  we include an allocation of sales value for all solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the net sales of our components segment 
in the gross profit of our operating segment disclosures  we include the corresponding cost of sales value for the solar modules installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the components segment 
the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured cost incurred by our components segment 
after we have determined the amount of revenue earned for our systems projects following the applicable accounting guidance for the underlying sales arrangements  we allocate module revenue from the systems segment to the components segment based on how our codm strategically views these segments 
the amount of module revenue allocated from the systems segment to the components segment is equal to an estimated average selling price for such solar modules as if the modules were sold to a third party epc customer through a long term supply agreement that establishes pricing at the beginning of each year 
in order to develop the estimate of the average selling price used for this revenue allocation  we utilize a combination of our actual third party module sale transactions  our competitor benchmarking and our internal pricing lists used to provide module price quotes to customers 
this allocation methodology and the estimated average selling prices are consistent with how our codm views the value proposition our components business brings to a utility scale systems project and the financial information reviewed by our codm in assessing our components business performance 
our components and systems segments have certain of their own dedicated administrative key functions  such as accounting  legal  finance  project finance  human resources  procurement  and marketing 
costs for these functions are recorded and included within the respective selling  general and administrative costs for our components and systems segments 
our corporate key functions consist primarily of company wide corporate tax  corporate treasury  corporate accounting finance  corporate legal  investor relations  corporate communications  and executive management functions 
these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments 
we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling  general and administrative costs  based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions 
we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling  general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations 
infrequent and other miscellaneous costs  including restructuring and manufacturing excursions are included in the components or systems segment operating results based upon which segment incurred the underlying costs

due to the distinct size and terms of the underlying sales arrangements for each project under construction  timing of revenue recognition may create uneven net sales patterns  making year over year comparisons less meaningful 
product revenue the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar modules and solar power systems net sales for the years ended december   december  and december  for the purpose of the following table  a solar module revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of solar modules to third parties  and b solar power systems revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of complete solar power systems and related services including the solar modules installed in the solar power systems

net sales from our systems segment  which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects  increased by  million  primarily due to increases in net sales from our av solar ranch one  topaz  copper mountain  st 
clair  silver state north  alpine  imperial energy center south  and avra valley projects  partially offset by decreases in net sales from our agua caliente  amherstburg  santa teresa and paloma projects 
the increase in net sales is due to the number and size of projects under construction between the periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
net sales from our components segment decreased million primarily due to a decrease in module average selling prices  including modules used in our systems projects  and an decrease in the volume of watts sold 
cost of sales years ended year over dollars in thousands year change cost of sales components systems cost of sales of net sales the increase in cost of sales during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to an million increase in our systems segment primarily for bos and other construction costs related to an increase in the number and size of various utility scale solar power systems under construction between the periods 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales for our components segment of million including decreases of million due to a reduction in the volume of solar modules sold and continuous cost reductions in our manufacturing process and a million reduction in expense for costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts related to our june june manufacturing excursion 
these component segment decreases were partially offset by a million increase related to the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity primarily related to the idling of manufacturing lines in perrysburg  malaysia and germany during portions of  a million increase for certain lower of cost or market inventory write downs primarily as a result of declines in market pricing  a million increase related to accelerated deprecation for certain manufacturing equipment that will be replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs  and a million increase in expense for costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for a workmanship issue affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october and june our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by per watt  or  from in to in and included of non cash stock based compensation 
the decrease is the result of increased module conversion efficiencies realized  partially offset by increased underutilization during the year ended december  gross profit years ended year over dollars in thousands year change gross profit of net sales gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by percentage points in compared with this decrease was primarily attributable to a percentage point decrease due to lower third party module average selling prices and volumes  a percentage point decrease related to plant underutilization  a percentage point decrease resulting from lower of cost or market inventory write downs due to declines in market pricing during the year ended december   a percentage point decrease due to lower module gross profit for modules used in our systems projects  a percentage point decrease due to accelerated depreciation on certain manufacturing equipment that have been replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs and a percentage point decrease related to costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for a workmanship issue potentially affecting a limited number of solar modules manufacturing between october and june the decreases were partially offset by a percentage point increase in systems segment gross profit due to the mix of higher gross profit projects under construction between the periods and a percentage point increase related to reduced costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our june to june manufacturing excursion 
research and development years ended year over dollars in thousands year change research and development of net sales the decrease in research and development expense of million was primarily due to a million decrease in personnel related expenses primarily driven by decreases in share based compensation expense of million 
additionally  facilities expense decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for  share based compensation expense decreased from  primarily as a result of the impact of an increase in our actual forfeitures primarily due to restructuring activities and an increase in the estimated forfeiture rate for share based compensation awards during these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in testing and qualification materials costs and a million increase in other expenses  which included non capital projects and the disposal of miscellaneous property  plant and equipment

there was also a million decrease in project development and selling costs  a million decrease in professional service costs  a million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts expense  a million decrease due to a reduction in travel expense  and a million decrease due to lower expense in related to the june to june manufacturing excursion 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in infrastructure expenses relating to the early termination of certain leases and increased depreciation  and a million increase in other expenses relating to the disposal of miscellaneous property  plant and equipment

liquidity and capital resources as of december   although we had a net loss for the year  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our project pipeline  availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements  and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we intend to continue to carefully execute our long term strategic plan and manage credit and market risk 
however  if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions  we may not have sufficient resources to support the execution of our long term strategic plan 
cash generated from operations is our primary source of operating liquidity and we believe that internally generated cash flows combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements are sufficient to support day to day business operations 
our treasury department monitors our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity  both domestically and internationally  to support the execution of our long term strategic plan 
we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations  the overall cost of capital  cash requirements for operations  capital expenditures  and discretionary strategic spending 
in the future  we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings 
we believe that when necessary  we will have adequate access to the capital markets  although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient investor interest due to industry wide or company specific concerns 
such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms  we may be unable to execute our long term strategic plan 
as of december   we had  million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  compared with million as of december  as of december  and december   million and million  respectively  of our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in euros and us dollar denominated holdings 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
our expanding systems business required increased liquidity in and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future 
solar power project development cycles  which span the time between the identification of a site location to the commercial operation of a pv power plant  vary substantially and can take many years to mature 
as a result of these long project cycles  we may need to make significant up front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such systems projects 
these amounts include payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are non refundable  posting of letters of credit  and incurring engineering  permitting  legal  and other expenses 
additionally  we may have to use our working capital or the availability under our revolving credit facility to finance the construction of our systems projects  if such projects cannot be sold before construction begins 
depending upon the size and number of projects that we are developing and self financing the construction of  the systems business may require significant liquidity 
for example  we may have to substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold 
delays in construction or in completing the sale of our systems projects which we are self financing may also impact our liquidity 
we have historically financed these up front investments for project development and when necessary  construction  primarily using working capital 
the following significant developments in have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity the amount of accounts receivable  unbilled as of december  was million and primarily represented revenues recognized on construction work performed on systems projects in advance of billings to the customer under the terms of the underlying construction contracts 
such construction costs have been funded with working capital and the unbilled amounts are expected to be billed and collected from customers during the next months 
additionally  we had million of retainage included within other assets  which represents the portion of a systems project contract price earned by us for work performed  but held for payment by our customer as a form of security until we reach certain construction milestones 
such retainage amounts relate to construction work already performed  but are noncurrent in nature as they are expected to be billed and collected from customers beyond the next months 
the amount of finished goods inventory solar module inventory and bos parts as of december  was million and represented a increase from december  as we continue with the construction of our project pipeline we must produce solar modules and procure bos parts in the required volumes to support our planned construction schedules 
as part of the normal construction cycle  we typically must produce or acquire the necessary materials for construction activities in advance of receiving payment for such materials 
once solar modules and bos parts are installed in a project  such installed amounts are classified as either project assets  deferred project costs  or cost of sales depending upon whether the project is subject to a definitive sales contract and whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
accordingly  as of any consolidated balance sheet date  our solar module inventory represents solar modules that will be installed in our project pipeline or that we expect to sell to third parties 
there may be a delay in when our solar module inventory and bos parts to be installed in our projects can be converted into cash compared to a typical third party module sale 
such timing differences temporarily reduce our liquidity to the extent that we have already paid for our bos parts or the underlying costs to produce our solar module inventories 
as previously announced  we have reduced our manufacturing capacity and planned solar module production levels to match expected market demand  which considers our systems project pipeline 
this decrease in planned production reduces our risk and the impact on liquidity of having excess solar module inventories that we must sell to third parties as we execute our long term strategic plan and respond to market pricing uncertainties for solar modules 
our solar module inventory as of december  is expected to primarily support our systems business with the remaining amounts being used to support expected near term demand for third party module sales 
as of december   approximately million or of our solar module inventory was either on site or in transit to our systems projects 
of this amount  approximately million of solar module inventories or of the total solar module inventory balance was physically segregated for certain projects for the purpose of qualifying such projects for the department of treasury s section cash grant program prior to the program s expiration in december such segregated solar module inventories are expected to be installed in the underlying systems projects in the normal course of our construction 
all bos parts are for our systems business projects 
with the closure at the end of of our frankfurt oder manufacturing plants and our strategy to focus our sales efforts on providing utility scale systems solutions to sustainable markets  our near term liquidity may be adversely impacted as we continue to shift our selling efforts from the european markets  in which we have historically generated a significant portion of our net sales  to new markets  in which we have not historically generated any meaningful portion of our net sales 
additionally  as discussed further above  our utility scale systems solutions  including development and construction of such utility scale systems  have in the past and are expected in the future to require the use of our working capital and other sources of liquidity in advance of receiving any payments for the sale of such projects 
the liquidity requirements for such systems projects can be greater than the working capital required for the sale of solar modules 
we believe that the sold contracted portion of our advance stage systems project pipeline will provide us with sufficient liquidity and working capital to prudently execute our long term strategic plan 
in connection with the execution of our long term strategic plan  we expect joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners to be a key part of our strategy 
we have begun initiatives in several markets to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential strategic partners  customers  and policymakers 
some of these business arrangements  focused primarily on development efforts to expand our project pipeline in sustainable markets  are expected to involve a significant cash investment or other allocation of working capital that may reduce our liquidity or require us to pursue additional sources of financing  assuming such sources are available to us 
additionally  in order to execute our long term strategic plan in such markets  we may elect or be required to temporarily retain an ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop or construct 
any such retained ownership interest is expected to impact our liquidity to the extent we do not obtain new sources of capital to fund such investments 
our restructuring charges  including the restructuring initiatives announced in december  february and april  are expected to result in total cash payments of between million and million  of which approximately million was already made as of december  such cash payments are primarily related to severance costs and the repayment of government grants for the second frankfurt oder plant 
there is the potential for additional future restructuring actions as we continue to align our manufacturing capacity with market demand  evaluate our cost structure and identify potential cost savings opportunities  and focus on developing target markets 
we could in the future incur additional restructuring costs including potentially the repayment of debt facilities and other amounts  the payment of severance to terminated employees  and other restructuring related costs that could reduce our liquidity position to the point where we need to pursue additional sources of financing  assuming such sources are available to us 
see note restructuring  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
during  we expect to spend up to million for capital expenditures  including expenditures for upgrades to existing machinery and equipment  which we believe will increase our solar module efficiencies 
a majority of our capital expenditures for are expected to be in foreign currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
under the sales agreements for a limited number of our solar power projects  we may be required to repurchase such projects if certain events occur  such as not achieving commercial operation of the project within a certain time frame 
although we consider the possibility that we would be required to repurchase any of our solar power projects to be remote  our current working capital and other available sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to make any required repurchase 
if we are required to repurchase a solar power project we would have the ability to market and sell such project at then current market pricing  which could be at a lower than expected price to the extent the event requiring a repurchase impacts the project s marketability 
our liquidity may also be impacted as the time between the repurchase of a project and the potential sale of such repurchased project could take several months 
the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that began in and the current instability in europe have had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions 
the ongoing sovereign debt problems in europe and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of european banks in particular could negatively impact our access to  and cost of  capital  and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and competitive position 
it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the demand for our systems projects or solar modules 
as of december   our liquidity and marketable securities and restricted investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment  and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the current credit environment 
cash flows the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december   december   and december  in thousands years ended net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million during  compared with cash used in operating activities of million during and cash provided by operating activities of million during the increase in operating cash flows during was primarily due to higher net cash received from customers in  as compared to and this increase was partially offset by an increase in net cash paid to suppliers during  as compared to and in addition  income taxes paid  net of refunds decreased from payments of million and million in and  respectively  to a net refund of million in  primarily due to certain german income tax refunds received during the remaining increase in cash provided by operating activities was the result of net differences in excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements  interest received and interest paid in compared to and investing activities cash used in investing activities was million during  compared with million during and million during cash used in investing activities during included capital expenditures of million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to a lower amount of capital expenditures during related to our previously planned manufacturing plants in vietnam and mesa  arizona compared to capital expenditures made during and related to manufacturing plant expansions primarily in malaysia and germany

in july  we acquired nextlight renewable power  llc  a leading developer of utility scale solar projects in the southwestern united states for million 
the remaining change in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a reduction in restricted cash during compared to financing activities cash used in financing activities was million during compared with cash provided by financing activities of million during and million during cash used in financing activities during resulted primarily from the repayment of long term debt  which included our german facility agreement  for a total of million and the repayment of economic development funding of million  partially offset by the net proceeds from our revolving credit facility of million and excess tax benefit from share based compensation arrangements of million 
cash provided by financing activities was million during and resulted primarily from proceeds of million from borrowings on our malaysian ringgit facility agreement  german facility agreement  and malaysian euro facility along with million of net proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  we recorded excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements of million and received cash from employee stock option exercises of million

contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands  which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments 
we purchase raw materials for inventory or balance of systems parts  services  and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors 
we also enter into contracts for the construction of systems business solar power projects 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing and construction lead times and help assure adequate supply  we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements each year or over the term of the agreement

interest payments are based on fixed and floating rates in effect at december  and include the effect of interest rate and cross currency swap agreements 
purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are non cancellable  enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of transactions 
we assume our collection and recycling obligations will be satisfied more than five years from december  in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  we have recorded million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc  income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
debt and credit sources as of december   we had million in outstanding long term debt  excluding amounts related to capital leases and unamortized discount  and million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure  transaction exposure  and earnings translation exposure 
cash flow exposure we expect our subsidiaries to have material future cash flows  including net sales and expenses  that will be denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
our primary cash flow exposures are cash received from customers  cash paid to suppliers and associates 
changes in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries functional currencies and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled 
accordingly  we enter into foreign exchange forward and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows 
these foreign exchange forward and cross currency swap contracts qualified as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  and we designated them as such 
we initially report the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the underlying hedged transaction is settled 
our operations in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses  such as associate wages and utilities  in malaysian ringgit  exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk for those malaysian ringgit expenses 
as a result of our restructuring of our european operations including the closure of our frankfurt oder plant at the end of  our exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the euro is significantly reduced compared to and for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities  refer to note derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our international operations accounted for   and of our net sales during the years ended december   december   and december   respectively  of which   and of these international sales  respectively  were denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales 
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly in the us dollar to euro and us dollar to malaysian ringgit  affect our gross profit and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses 
in the past  most of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the time we sign and settle our sales contracts denominated in euros 
for the years ended december   december   and december   a change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by million  million  and million  respectively  excluding the effect of our hedging activities 
our net sales denominated in euros are expected to continue to decline and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk associated with the euro is expected to also decline 
transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables  investments  accounts payable  debt and accrued liabilities  and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency 
changes in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries functional currencies and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivative instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the short term effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the gains and losses on these derivative instruments will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities 
these contracts typically have maturities of less than three months 
for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities  refer to note derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
if the us dollar would have weakened by against the euro  malaysian ringgit  and canadian dollar  the impact on our loss before income taxes during the year ended december  would have been million unfavorable 
if the us dollar would have weakened by against the euro  malaysian ringgit  and canadian dollar the impact on our income loss before income taxes during the years ended december  and december  would have been million favorable and million unfavorable  respectively 
earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries that do not have a us dollar functional currency 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations 
these contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in earnings 
we do not hedge translation exposure at this time  but may do so in the future 
in the past  currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by million  million  and million in the years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations  we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
we will continue to evaluate actions we can take to use derivative instruments to help mitigate this risk 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risks are our outstanding variable rate debt  our solar power system sales prices from the effect of interest rates on our customer s financing of such solar power systems  and our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments 
variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk because our revolving credit facility  malaysian ringgit facility agreement  malaysian euro facility agreement  and the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement have variable interest rates  exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows 
we use interest rate and cross currency swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of our variable rate debt instruments 
we have interest rate swap contracts in place to mitigate the interest rate risk for a portion of the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement 
we also have a cross currency swap contract in place to mitigate the interest rate risk of our malaysian ringgit facility agreement 
for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities  refer to note derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
an increase in the euro interbank offered rate euribor would impact our cost of borrowing under our malaysian euro facility agreement and an increase in the london interbank offered rate libor would impact our cost of borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
if euribor changes by basis points  our interest cost for the year ended december  would have changed by million 
if libor changed by basis points  our interest cost for the year ended december  would have changed by million 
effect of interest rates on our customer s financing of solar power systems we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our systems business customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase a solar power system from us 
although the useful life of a solar power system is considered to be approximately years  owners of our solar power systems must pay the entire cost of the solar power system by the time such system is completed 
as a result  many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditures 
an increase in interest rates available to finance such purchases could make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing and underlying interest rate necessary to purchase a system 
this could lower demand or the price we can charge for our solar power systems and reduce our net sales and gross profit 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase solar power systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems  which  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 
investments in marketable securities and related investment exposure we invest in various debt securities  which exposes us to interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment may decline 
as of december   our marketable securities earned a pre tax yield of  with a weighted average maturity of months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously change by basis points  the market value of our total investment portfolio would change by million 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our marketable security portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   all of our marketable securities were in commercial paper  corporate debt securities  federal and foreign agency debt  foreign government obligations  supranational debt  and us government obligations 
as of december   our restricted investments earned a pre tax yield of  with a weighted average maturity of approximately years 
if interest rates were to instantaneously change by basis points  the market value of our total restricted investment portfolio would change by million 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our restricted investment portfolio 
given that our restricted investment portfolio pre funds our estimated solar module collection and recycling obligations  and given the expected holding period of these investments  we believe it is unlikely that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   all of our restricted investments were in foreign and us government obligations 
commodity and component risk we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials  components  and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in solar power systems 
also  some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier 
we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process 
in some cases  we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components 
as a result  we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules 
in addition  a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices and or a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes 
we may be unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and systems to our customers  and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 
credit risk we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  restricted investments  trade accounts receivable  interest rate swap contracts  cross currency swap contracts  and foreign exchange forward contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  restricted investments  interest rate swap contracts  cross currency contracts  and foreign exchange forward contracts with various high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions 
in addition  we have certain investments in debt securities related to countries in the eurozone 
these investments are for debt securities of countries with a lower likelihood of experiencing significant economic  fiscal  and or political strains resulting in a default or severe decreases in fair value 
however  such risk cannot be entirely eliminated and is reflected in the current fair value of the investments as of december
