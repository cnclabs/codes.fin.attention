an important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies

this definition may differ from that used by our competitors or other companies 
for the year ended december   our sales through the digital online channels decreased by approximately million  as compared to  and our net revenues from digital online channels represented of our total consolidated net revenues in as compared to in these decreases were mainly attributable to the deferral of revenues due to the timing of the releases of diablo iii and world of warcraft mists of pandaria 
on a non gaap basis  our sales through the digital online channels increased by million  as compared to  and our net revenues from digital online channels represented of our total consolidated net revenues in as compared to in this increase in sales from the digital online channels was primarily due to the releases of diablo iii and world of warcraft mists of pandaria

current generation of game consoles the current generation of game consoles began with microsoft launch of the xbox in november  and continued in when sony and nintendo launched the ps and the wii  respectively 
the installed base of current generation hardware ie xbox  ps and wii in the us and europe was approximately million units as of december   as compared to million units at december   according to the npd group  with respect to north america  and gfk chart track  with respect to europe  representing an increase of in units year over year 
the installed base of ps and xbox hardware units increased year over year  while the installed base of wii hardware units increased year over year 
during the year end holiday season  nintendo released a new next generation high definition version console  the wii u 
on february   sony announced that it intends to launch playstation  its next generation computer entertainment system  by the year end holiday buying season 
we continually monitor console hardware sales  as well as the development of next generation consoles 
we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development 
conditions in the retail distribution channels conditions in the retail channels of the interactive entertainment industry remained challenging through in north america and europe  retail sales within the industry experienced a combined overall decrease of approximately in  as compared to  according to the npd group and gfk chart track 
the declines in the north america and european retail channels were impacted by fewer releases and catalog sales in as compared to  as well as price declines over the prior year 
in addition  the decline in sales to the retail channels continue to be more pronounced for casual titles on the nintendo wii and handheld platforms down over year over year  than titles on high definition platforms ie  xbox and ps 
despite the decrease in retail sales for the overall industry  according to the npd group  gfk chart track and the company internal estimates  the sales of the industry top five titles including accessory packs and figures grew in  as compared to this has resulted in the further concentration of revenues in the top titles  particularly for high definition platforms  which experienced year over year growth  while non premier titles experienced declines 
the company results have been less impacted by the general declining trends in retail compared to our competitors because of our greater focus on premier top titles and a more focused overall slate of titles 
concentration of top titles the concentration of retail revenues among key core titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry 
according to the npd group  the top titles accounted for of the sales in the us video game industry in as compared to in similarly  a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits 
for example  our four largest franchises in call of duty  diablo  skylanders and world of warcraft accounted for approximately of our net revenues  and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income  for the year 
we expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of the industry and our revenues and profits 

table of contents seasonality the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal 
we have historically experienced our highest sales volume in the year end holiday buying season  which occurs in the fourth quarter 
we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our software titles containing online functionality that constitutes a more than inconsequential separate service deliverable over an extended period of time ie  typically five months to less than a year 
as a result  the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue 
our results can also vary based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  title release date  consumer demand  market conditions and shipment schedule 
outlook looking forward  the above discussed factors  such as the ongoing console transition  increasing concentration of top titles in the interactive entertainment industry  and a continuingly challenged global economy  might negatively impact our short term results 
in addition  compared to will be a difficult year over year comparison due to the highly successful launch of diablo iii in may we will continue to invest in our established franchises  as well as new titles we think have the potential to drive our growth over the long term

table of contents for better understanding of the differences in presentation between our segment results and the consolidated results  the following explains the nature of each reconciling item 
net effect from deferral of net revenues and related cost of sales we have determined that some of our game online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and as a result a more than inconsequential separate deliverable 
as such  we are required to recognize the revenues of these game titles over the estimated service periods  which may range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year 
the related cost of sales is deferred and recognized as the related revenues are recognized 
in the table on the previous page  we present the amount of net revenues and related cost of sales separately for each period as a result of this accounting treatment 
stock based compensation expense we expense our stock based awards using the grant date fair value over the vesting periods of the stock awards 
in the case of liability awards  the liability is subject to revaluation based on the stock price at the end of the relevant period 
included within stock based compensation are the net effects of capitalization  deferral  and amortization 
restructuring on february   the company board of directors authorized a restructuring plan the restructuring involving a focus on the development and publication of a reduced slate of titles on a going forward basis 
the restructuring included the discontinuation of the development of music based games  the closure of the related business unit and the cancellation of other titles then in production  along with a related reduction in studio headcount and corporate overhead 
the costs related to the restructuring activities included severance costs  facility exit costs  and exit costs from the cancellation of projects 
the restructuring charges for the year ended december  were million  which is reflected in a separate caption restructuring expenses on our consolidated statement of operations 
the restructuring was completed as of december  and we do not expect to incur significant additional restructuring expenses relating thereto 
in  we implemented an organizational restructuring plan as a result of the business combination 
this organizational restructuring was to integrate different operations and to streamline the combined activision blizzard organization 
the costs related to the restructuring activities included severance costs  facility exit costs  write offs of assets and liabilities and exit costs from the cancellation of projects 
for the year ended december   expense related to the organizational restructuring was million and has been reflected in the general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the organizational restructuring activities as a result of the business combination were completed as of december  and we do not expect to incur additional restructuring expenses relating thereto 
amortization of intangible assets all of our intangible assets are the result of the business combination and other acquisitions 
we amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the underlying economic benefits 
the amount presented in the table represents the effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as other purchase price accounting adjustments  where applicable  in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents impairment of goodwill intangible assets we recorded a non cash charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill of our distribution reporting unit for the year ended december   reflecting a continuing shift in the distribution of interactive entertainment software from retail distribution channels to digital distribution channels 
furthermore  we recorded a non cash impairment charge on definite lived intangible assets of million for the year ended december   reflecting a continuing weaker environment for the casual game and music genres 
segment net revenues activision activision net revenues increased for as compared to  primarily due to revenues from the skylanders franchise both from the launch of skylanders giants in the fourth quarter of and the full year revenues from skylanders spyro adventure  which was launched in the fourth quarter of 
the increase was partially offset by lower revenues from the call of duty franchise primarily from lower catalog sales and lower revenues from downloadable content packs for call of duty modern warfare  though these decreases were partially mitigated by the strong performance from call of duty black ops ii which launched in the fourth quarter of for  net revenues from the activision segment increased as compared to primarily due to the strong performance of call of duty modern warfare and the strong digital revenue performance from the franchise  revenues from skylanders spyro adventure which successfully launched as a new intellectual property in the fourth quarter of  the release of lego star wars iii  which we published on behalf of lucas arts in europe and certain countries in asia pacific  and benefits from foreign exchange as compared to the prior year 
the increase was partially offset by a more focused release schedule in than in  and lower catalog sales of games in the music and casual games genre 
blizzard blizzard net revenues increased for as compared to  primarily due to the release of diablo iii in may and world of warcraft mists of pandaria in september the increase in net revenues was partially offset by lower subscription revenues from world of warcraft due to a lower subscriber base 
at december   the worldwide subscriber base for world of warcraft was approximately million  down from a base of more than million subscribers at september   and approximately million subscribers at december   with the majority of the decline from the east where the east includes china  taiwan  and korea  and the west includes north america  europe and latin america 
with the launch of world of warcraft cataclysm  in the fourth quarter of  the subscriber base reached a new peak at more than million subscribers at december  since that time  the subscriber base has trended downward 
looking forward  blizzard entertainment expects to continue to deliver new game content in all regions that is intended to further appeal to the gaming community

distribution net revenues increased in as compared to  primarily due to additional customer sales opportunities in the uk and benefits from foreign exchange as compared to prior year 
segment income from operations activision activision operating income increased in as compared to  primarily due to higher net revenues as described above  and lower sales and marketing costs 
the increase was partially offset by higher cost of sales as a result of higher net revenues  higher product development costs  and higher general and administrative costs  primarily resulting from legal related expenses including legal related accruals  settlements and fees and additional accrued bonuses reflecting our strong financial performance 
activision operating income increased in as compared to  primarily due to a more focused release of products that delivered higher operating margins  increased digital sales of call of duty digital content  resulting in high operating margins  and reduction of operating expenses resulting from the restructuring 
these positive impacts on operating income were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the launch of skylanders spyro adventure  call of duty modern warfare and call of duty elite and additional litigation activities and settlement of lawsuits 
blizzard blizzard operating income increased in as compared to  primarily due to higher revenues as described above

non gaap financial measures the analysis of revenues by distribution channel is presented both on a gaap including the impact from change in deferred revenues and non gaap excluding the impact from change in deferred revenues basis 
we use this non gaap measure internally when evaluating our operating performance  when planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods  and when assessing the performance of our management team 
we believe this is appropriate because this non gaap measure enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers  
table of contents which is consistent with the way the company is measured by investment analysts and industry data sources  and facilitates comparison of operating performance between periods 
in addition  excluding the impact from change in deferred net revenue provides a much more timely indication of trends in our sales and other operating results 
while we believe that this non gaap measure is useful in evaluating our business  this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from  as a substitute for  or as more important than  the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  this non gaap financial measure may not be the same as any non gaap measure presented by another company 
this non gaap financial measure has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the items associated with our gaap revenues 
we compensate for the limitations resulting from the exclusion of the change in deferred revenues by considering the impact of that item separately and by considering our gaap  as well as non gaap  revenues

cash flows used in financing activities the primary drivers of cash flows used in financing activities have historically related to transactions involving our common stock  including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees  payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common stock 
we have not historically utilized debt financing as a source of cash flows although we may do so in the future

under these agreements  we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor  developer or intellectual property holder  as the case may be  based upon contractual arrangements 
the payments to third party developers are generally conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of contractually specified development milestones 
further  these payments to third party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related game 
additionally  in connection with certain intellectual property rights acquisitions and development agreements  we commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game s which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized

table of contents financial disclosure we maintain internal control over financial reporting  which generally includes those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
we also are focused on our disclosure controls and procedures  which as defined by the securities and exchange commission the sec  are generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and non financial information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms  and that such information is communicated to management  including our principal executive and financial officers  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
our disclosure committee  which operates under the board approved disclosure committee charter and disclosure controls procedures policy  includes senior management representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures  as well as in implementing and evaluating our overall disclosure process 
as part of our disclosure process  senior finance and operational representatives from all of our corporate divisions and business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current quarter operational performance  future trends  subsequent events  internal controls  changes in internal controls and other accounting and disclosure relevant information 
these quarterly reports are reviewed by certain key corporate finance executives 
these corporate finance representatives also conduct quarterly interviews on a rotating basis with the preparers of selected quarterly reports 
the results of the quarterly reports and related interviews are reviewed by the disclosure committee 
finance representatives also conduct reviews with our senior management team  our legal counsel and other appropriate personnel involved in the disclosure process  as appropriate 
additionally  senior finance and operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the preparation of our periodic public reports filed with the sec 
financial results and other financial information also are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
as required by applicable regulatory requirements  the principal executive and financial officers review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of our periodic public reports filed with the sec  our disclosure controls and procedures  and our internal control over financial reporting 
with the assistance of the disclosure committee  we will continue to assess and monitor  and make refinements to  our disclosure controls and procedures  and our internal control over financial reporting 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the estimates and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition including revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables on january   we adopted amendments to an accounting standard related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables which standard  as amended  is referred to 
table of contents herein as the new accounting principles 
the new accounting principles establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and require the application of the relative selling price method to allocate the consideration received for an arrangement to each deliverable in a multiple deliverables revenue arrangement 
certain of our revenue arrangements have multiple deliverables and  as such  are accounted for under the new accounting principles 
these revenue arrangements include product sales consisting of both software and hardware deliverables such as peripherals or other ancillary collectors items sold together with physical boxed software and our sales of world of warcraft boxed products  expansion packs and value added services  each of which is considered with the related subscription services for these purposes 
our assessment of deliverables and units of accounting does not change under the new accounting principles 
pursuant to the guidance of asu  when a revenue arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if it is available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
in multiple element arrangements where more than incidental software deliverables are included  revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable  the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue 
as noted above  when neither vsoe nor tpe is available for a deliverable  we use besp 
we do not have significant revenue arrangements that require besp for the years ended december  and the inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the actual price charged by the company for a deliverable that the company sells separately  which represents the vsoe  and the wholesale prices of the same or similar products  which represents tpe 
the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for deliverables and allocation of the arrangement consideration did not change upon the adoption of the new accounting principles 
also  the adoption of the new accounting standard has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
overall  we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers and once any performance obligations have been completed 
certain products are sold to customers with a street date ie  the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers 
for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the date the product is sold to our customer 
revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection 
for our software products with online functionality  we evaluate whether those features or functionality are more than an inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product 
this evaluation is performed for each software product and any online transaction  such as a digital download of a title with product add ons  when it is released 
when we determine that a software title contains online functionality that constitutes a more than inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product  which  when we do  is principally because of its importance to gameplay  we consider our performance obligations for this title to extend beyond the sale of the game 
vsoe of fair value does not exist for the online functionality of some products  as we do not separately charge for this component of every title 
as a result  we recognize all of the software related revenue from the sale of any such title ratably over the estimated service period of such title 
in addition  we initially defer the costs of sales for the title excluding intangible asset amortization  and recognize the costs of sales as the related revenues are 
table of contents recognized 
cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  software royalties and amortization  and intellectual property licenses 
determining whether the online functionality for a particular game constitutes more than an inconsequential deliverable  as well as the estimated service periods and product life over which to recognize the revenue and related costs of sales  is subjective and require management judgment 
we recognize revenues from world of warcraft boxed product  expansion packs and value added services  in each case with the related subscription service revenue  ratably over the estimated service period beginning upon activation of the software and delivery of the related services 
revenues attributed to the sale of world of warcraft boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as product sales  whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other value added services are classified as subscription  licensing  and other revenues 
revenue for software products with more than inconsequential separate service deliverables and world of warcraft products are recognized over the estimated service periods  which range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year 
for our software products with features we consider to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable  such as products which provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer  we recognize the related revenue from them upon the transfer of title and risk of loss of the product to our customer 
allowances for returns  price protection  doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence we closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles  the performance of products released by other publishers  market conditions  and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles 
initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are sufficient to meet the demand from the retail markets  but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel 
we benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data 
we may permit product returns from  or grant price protection to  our customers under certain conditions 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to decrease  on a short or longer term basis  the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and  when granted and applicable  allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and or future invoices 
the conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection include  among other things  compliance with applicable trading and payment terms  and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell through reports to us 
we may also consider other factors  including the facilitation of slow moving inventory and other market factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period based on estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenue 
we estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenue utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
the following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title historical performance of titles in similar genres  historical performance of the hardware platform  historical performance of the franchise  console hardware life cycle  sales force and retail customer feedback  industry pricing  future pricing assumptions  weeks of on hand retail channel inventory  absolute quantity of on hand retail channel inventory  our warehouse on hand inventory levels  the title recent sell through history if available  marketing trade programs  
table of contents and performance of competing titles 
the relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon  among other items  genre  platform  seasonality  and sales strategy 
based upon historical experience  we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including  among others  a lack of consumer acceptance of a title  the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor  or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection 
for example  a change in our december  allowance for sales returns  price protection and other allowances would have impacted net revenues by approximately million 
similarly  management must make estimates as to the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customers payment terms and their economic condition  as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance 
any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channels 
we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value  based upon assumptions about future demand  which are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions 
at the point of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis 
software development costs and intellectual property licenses software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements  as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products 
we account for software development costs in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed accounting standards codification asc subtopic 
software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable 
technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation  or the completed and tested product design and working model 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established 
for products where proven technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
prior to a product release  we expense  as part of cost of sales software royalties and amortization  capitalized costs if and when we believe such amounts are not recoverable 
capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or expected to be abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation 
amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense 
commencing upon product release  capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product  generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less 
intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks  copyrights  software  technology  music or other intellectual property or 
table of contents proprietary rights in the development of our products 
depending upon the agreement with the rights holder  we may obtain the right to use the intellectual property in multiple products over a number of years  or alternatively  for a single product 
prior to the related product release  we expense  as part of cost of sales intellectual property licenses  capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable 
capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or expected to be abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation 
commencing upon the related product release  capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales intellectual property licenses based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized 
as intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years  the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis 
for products that have been released in prior periods  the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance 
for products that are scheduled to be released in future periods  recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used 
criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology  market performance of comparable titles  orders for the product prior to its release  general market conditions  and  for any sequel product  estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based 
further  as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years  we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors  such as the success of other products and or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property  whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property  and the rights holder continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs 
in evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs  the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred 
if revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis  the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter  which could result in an impairment charge 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with fasb income tax guidance asc topic  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability 
for those assets that do not meet the threshold of more likely than not that they will be realized in the future  a valuation allowance is recorded 

table of contents management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expenses in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of asc topic and other complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management expectations could have a material impact on our business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in foreign regions where taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates and or higher than anticipated in the united states where taxes are levied at relatively higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  by expiration of or lapses in the r d tax credit laws  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  by tax costs related to intercompany realignments  by differences between amounts included in our tax filings and the estimate of such amounts included in our tax expenses  by changes in accounting principles  or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income  or the foreign tax credit rules 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions  including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount  and the cost approach  which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets  we use 
table of contents the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models  which require us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset  liability or equity instrument being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows that is  the risk premium 
determining these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective  and  if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill  which is an asset that is not amortized 
often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset  the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in process technology 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 
assessment of impairment of assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with fasb literature related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets within asc subtopic  which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists 
we considered certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets  other than indefinite lived intangible assets  may not be recoverable including  but not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time  and changes in our business strategy 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
if an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million to our definite lived intangible assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the determination of the impairment charges recorded for the year ended december  we did not record an impairment charge to our definite lived intangible assets as of december  and fasb literature related to the accounting for goodwill and other intangibles within asc topic provides companies an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before performing a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit 
our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
asc topic requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
the qualitative assessment is optional 
the first step 
table of contents measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
to determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  and future economic and market conditions 
these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
fair value of our reporting units is determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flow models 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we assumed a discount rate of approximately 
the estimated fair value of the activision publishing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately billion or at least as of december  the estimated fair value of the blizzard reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value as of december  however  changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value  which will be a function of our future financial performance  and changes in economic conditions could result in future impairment charges 
we test acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value 
we have determined that no impairment has occurred at december  and based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows  which represent our best estimate of future performance at this time 
in determining the fair value of our trade names  we assumed a discount rate of  and royalty saving rates of approximately 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would not yield an impairment charge to our trade names 
changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value  which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions  could result in future impairment charges 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is recognized during the requisite service periods that is  the period for which the employee is being compensated and is based on the value of stock based payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate the value of stock based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial lattice model 
our determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 

table of contents we generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights including restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and performance shares based on the closing market price of the company common stock on the date of grant 
certain restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management vest based on the achievement of pre established performance or market goals 
we estimate the fair value of performance based restricted stock rights at the closing market price of the company common stock on the date of grant 
each quarter  we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved 
we amortize the fair values of performance based restricted stock rights over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award 
we estimate the fair value of market based restricted stock rights at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award 
the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market based restricted stock rights at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 
provided that the requisite service is rendered  the total fair value of the market based restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved 
however  the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
recently issued accounting pronouncements indefinite lived intangible assets impairment in july  the fasb issued an update to the authoritative guidance related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this update gives an entity the option to first consider certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
this update is effective for the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
balance sheet offsetting disclosures in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the disclosure of financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented for annual periods beginning on or after january  and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of this guidance does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive loss in february  the fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring new disclosures about reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income 
these disclosures may be presented on the face of the statements or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the standards update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices 
our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and market prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  australian dollars  south korean won and swedish krona 
currency volatility is monitored throughout the year 
to mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposure resulting from our foreign currency denominated monetary assets  liabilities and earnings  we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts  principally swaps and forward contracts with maturities of twelve months or less 
vivendi is our principal counterparty and the risks of counterparty non performance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
we expect to continue to use economic hedge programs in the future to reduce foreign exchange related volatility if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk 
all foreign currency economic hedging transactions are backed  in amount and by maturity  by an identified economic underlying item 
we do not hold or purchase any foreign currency contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and the associated gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in investment and other income expense  net and general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange swaps was million and million at december  and  respectively 
pretax net unrealized losses of less than million and million for the years ended and  respectively  resulted from the foreign exchange contracts and swaps with vivendi and were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
pretax realized gains of million and less than million were recognized in general and administrative expenses at december  and  respectively 
the consolidated statements of operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income from our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
we recognized a realized gain of million for the year ended december  from the settlement of the hedging foreign exchange contracts and there was no outstanding foreign exchange contract hedging translation risk as of december  in the absence of the hedging activities described above  as of december   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of would have resulted in potential declines in our net income of approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds that invest in highly rated government backed securities  highly rated commercial paper  and debt instruments with high credit 
table of contents quality and relatively short average maturities 
because short term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash  cash equivalents or short term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
conversely  the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk in our investment portfolio 
at december   our billion of cash and cash equivalents were comprised primarily of money market funds 
at december   our million of short term investments included million of us treasury and government sponsored agency debt securities  million of restricted cash  and million of corporate bonds 
we had million in auction rate securities at fair value classified as long term investments at december  the company has determined that  based on the composition of our investment portfolio as of december   there was no material interest rate risk exposure to the company consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of that date
