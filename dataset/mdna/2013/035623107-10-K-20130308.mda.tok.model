item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management overview fiscal was a very strong year for ann inc  reflecting solid top line growth  improved gross margin performance and double digit percentage increases in operating income  net income and diluted earnings per share compared with fiscal these results were driven by strong client response to our product offering throughout much of the year  as well as the positive effects of our strategic growth initiatives 
we provided our clients with seamless access to our ann taylor and loft merchandise through the first phase launch of our multi channel initiative in fall in addition  we successfully executed our real estate strategy  adding new stores across the fleet  which included three new stores in toronto  canada  marking the first step in growing our brands internationally 
at the ann taylor brand  overall comparable sales increased  on top of a increase in fiscal at our multi channel ann taylor business  which includes ann taylor stores and anntaylor 
com  comparable sales increased  while at ann taylor factory  comparable sales declined 
results at ann taylor reflected the impact of our strategies for the brand  which included offering a better balance of fashion and basics within each merchandise category  more depth in key fashion items and a greater breadth of the assortment at opening price points 
in addition  we continued efforts to create a more engaging and personalized in store experience for our client and lowered our promotional stance  which resulted in higher gross margin rate performance as compared to fiscal the loft brand delivered a comparable sales increase of in fiscal  on top of an increase in fiscal at our multi channel loft business  which includes loft stores and loft 
com  comparable sales increased  which was partially offset by a decrease of in the loft outlet channel 
clients responded positively to loft merchandise assortments  which contributed to an overall increase in full price sell through as compared to fiscal  despite the effect of a fourth quarter merchandise offering that was overinvested in bright colors 
gross margin rate performance was slightly below fiscal levels  due in part to a higher promotional stance during the fourth quarter of fiscal our fiscal real estate strategy was focused on expanding our store presence at both brands  enhancing store productivity across the entire fleet and opening our first international stores in canada  as well as continued execution of selective store closures 
at the ann taylor brand  we opened new ann taylor stores  including two stores in canada  and updated or right sized an additional existing stores to reflect our new brand aesthetic 
as a result of these capital investments  nearly two thirds of the ann taylor store fleet now reflects our new brand aesthetic 
at ann taylor factory  we opened three new stores during fiscal at loft  we continued to move forward with the expansion of our loft brand store fleet  opening new loft stores  primarily in small to mid markets  including our first international loft store in canada 
we also opened new loft outlet stores in fiscal throughout fiscal  we demonstrated our commitment to enhance shareholder value and maintain a healthy balance sheet and cash position 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock  representing nearly of outstanding shares  at a cost of million  closing the year with million in cash and no bank debt 
we also continued to closely manage inventory levels throughout the year  and ended the year with total inventory per square foot flat as compared to fiscal looking ahead  our focus in fiscal is to continue to move forward with our initiatives to strengthen our connection to our client  both by keeping existing loyal clients engaged and attracting new clients to shop our brands 
we plan to continue efforts to optimize our store portfolio and enhance our in store shopping experience  as well as further our canadian expansion 
we also expect to continue to grow our e commerce business by further capitalizing on our recently launched multi channel capabilities  offering our clients a more personalized online shopping experience and adding international shipping capabilities in certain countries outside the united states at both of our online stores 
finally  we intend to use our strong free cash flow to invest in the profitable growth of ann inc 
as a means of delivering value to our shareholders 

table of contents key performance indicators in evaluating our performance  senior management reviews certain key performance indicators  including comparable sales comparable sales comps provide a measure of existing store sales performance 
a store is included in comparable sales in its thirteenth month of operation 
a store with a square footage change of more than is treated as a new store for the first year following its reopening 
sales from our online stores are also included in comparable sales 
in a fiscal year with weeks  such as fiscal  sales in the last week of that fiscal year are excluded from comparable sales 
gross margin gross margin measures our ability to control the direct costs of merchandise sold during the period 
gross margin is the difference between net sales and cost of sales  which includes the cost of merchandise sold  costs to transport merchandise from third party suppliers to our distribution center  including customs costs  costs associated with our sourcing operations  costs associated with the fulfillment and shipment of online and multi channel sales  depreciation related to merchandise management systems  sample development costs  and the direct costs of our credit card loyalty program 
buying and occupancy costs are excluded from cost of sales 
operating income because retailers do not uniformly record supply chain  buying and or occupancy costs as components of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses  operating income allows us to benchmark our performance relative to other retailers 
operating income represents earnings before interest and income taxes and measures our earnings power from ongoing operations 
store productivity store productivity  including sales per square foot  average unit retail price aur  units per transaction upt  dollars per transaction dpt  traffic and conversion  is evaluated by management in assessing our operating performance 
inventory turnover inventory turnover measures our ability to sell our merchandise and how many times it is replaced over time 
this ratio is important in determining the need for markdowns  planning future inventory levels and assessing client response to our merchandise 
quality of merchandise offerings to monitor and maintain client acceptance of our merchandise offerings  we monitor sell through levels  inventory turnover  gross margin  returns and markdown rates at a class and style level 
this analysis helps identify merchandise issues at an early date and helps us plan future product development and buying

table of contents store data the following table sets forth certain store data fiscal year ended february  january  january  stores square feet stores square feet stores square feet square feet in thousands stores and square footage ann taylor brand ann taylor ann taylor factory total ann taylor brand loft brand loft loft outlet total loft brand total company number of stores open at beginning of period new stores downsized expanded stores  net closed stores stores open at end of period converted stores during fiscal  we downsized ann taylor stores  four ann taylor factory stores  five loft stores and one loft outlet store 
during fiscal  we downsized ann taylor stores and three ann taylor factory stores 
during fiscal  we downsized five ann taylor stores and two loft stores and expanded one ann taylor store 
during fiscal  we converted six ann taylor stores to loft stores and four loft stores to loft outlet stores 
there were no store conversions in fiscal or fiscal comparison of fiscal years and total net sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal  with comparable sales increasing 
approximately million of the increase in total net sales was due to the effect of the rd week in fiscal despite challenges in the back half of the year  due  in part  to the lingering effects of superstorm sandy in the northeast region  both brands experienced increases in total net sales and comparable sales in fiscal both brands also benefited from the third quarter launch of the first phase of our multi channel initiative  which enabled store order fulfillment of internet sales  and contributed to higher traffic and conversion 
in addition  during fiscal  we recognized million in revenue related to gift card and merchandise credit breakage  where we determined there was no legal obligation to escheat the value of the cards under unclaimed property laws and the likelihood of redemption was considered remote 
fiscal is the first period during which we recognized gift card and merchandise credit breakage  and therefore includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold and merchandise credits issued since inception of these programs 
at the ann taylor brand  total net sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal  with comparable sales increasing 
sales at our multi channel ann taylor business  which includes ann taylor stores and anntaylor 
com  benefited from a merchandise mix that reflected the brand updated assortment and pricing strategies 
in addition  beginning in late spring  our merchandise assortments offered a much higher penetration of color and a broader range of relevant fashion at opening price points  contributing to higher traffic  conversion and upts 
at ann taylor factory  we experienced a increase in total net sales  due to higher upts  an increase in conversion and the addition of three new stores  partially offset by the effect of a decrease in traffic 

table of contents at the loft brand  total net sales increased million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal  with comparable sales up 
at our multi channel loft business  which includes loft stores and loft 
com  clients responded positively to the brand entire merchandise assortment  however  our full year results were impacted by a fourth quarter investment in bright colors that did not resonate with our clients during the holiday season 
while this impacted our fourth quarter top line results  for the full year period  we experienced increases in both traffic and conversion  which contributed to higher full price sell through 
at loft outlet  we experienced higher conversion and an increase in upts  however  inventory levels were constrained in the back half of fiscal  which contributed to a comparable sales decrease of for the full year period 
comparison of fiscal years and total net sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal with comparable sales increasing 
full price sell through increased over last year at both brands  with significant increases in the loft stores channel 
both brands experienced comparable sales gains for the year  with significant double digit comparable sales percentage growth at our online stores and at loft outlet 
by brand  ann taylor s net sales increased approximately million  or in fiscal as compared with fiscal  as comparable sales increased 
at the loft brand  net sales increased million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal  with comparable sales up 
ann taylor s fiscal results were impacted by a miss in the print and novelty components of the ann taylor stores channel merchandise assortment in late spring and a merchandise mix during the fall season that lacked depth in fashion and did not offer enough choices at opening price points 
although traffic remained steady across all channels  we were more promotional than planned in the ann taylor stores channel  particularly during the back half of the year 
this resulted in lower aurs and dpts and contributed to a decrease in comparable sales 
at anntaylor 
com  we experienced significant top line growth over last year  with comparable sales increasing  driven by increases in traffic  conversion and average order value 
sales at ann taylor factory stores were also up  reflecting a increase in comparable sales and the addition of seven new stores 
loft fiscal results reflected client acceptance of the brand feminine  casual fashion and value proposition  particularly in the loft stores channel  where comparable sales increased 
the brand also experienced higher levels of full price sell through  as well as year over year increases in dpts and upts 
loft also experienced strong top line growth at loft 
com  reflecting increases in traffic  conversion  and average order value 
in addition  sales at loft outlet increased significantly as a result of a increase in comparable sales and our accelerated spring expansion in this channel 
our net sales do not show significant seasonal variation 
as a result  we have not had significant overhead and other costs generally associated with large seasonal variations 
cost of sales and gross margin because retailers do not uniformly record supply chain  buying and or occupancy costs as cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses  our gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  may not be comparable to other retailers

the following table presents cost of sales and gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended february  january  january  dollars in thousands cost of sales gross margin percentage of net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  an increase from in fiscal our full year gross margin results were positively impacted by favorable client response to our merchandise offerings  which enabled fewer store wide promotions and more targeted promotional activity during most of the year 
this contributed to higher merchandise gross margin rate performance as compared to fiscal in addition  our full year gross margin rate performance was positively impacted by the gross margin effect of gift card and merchandise credit breakage 
these improvements were partially offset by a period over period increase in client shipping costs during the back half of fiscal  due  in part  to the effect of our multi channel initiative 

table of contents gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  down from in fiscal at ann taylor  full price sell through was negatively impacted by a miss in the print and novelty components in our spring merchandise assortment at ann taylor stores  as well as a lack of depth in fashion and breadth at opening price points in the back half of the year 
this  combined with the highly promotional retail environment we faced late in the year  also impacted the brand overall gross margin rate performance 
at loft  strong client acceptance of the brand merchandise offering contributed to higher levels of full price sell through in the loft stores channel  which also drove higher gross margin rate performance 
loft was also able to maintain its planned promotional strategy despite the highly competitive retail environment

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of working capital is cash flow from operations 
our primary ongoing cash requirements relate to the purchase of inventory and property and equipment 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain measures of our liquidity fiscal year ended february  january  january  dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities working capital current ratio operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million  to million  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the result of higher net income adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in merchandise inventories  accounts payable and accrued expenses  with the latter driven by changes in short term compensation accruals 
these increases were partially offset by changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets  primarily related to the timing of february rent payments 
cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher net income adjusted for non cash expenses  changes in long term compensation and prepaid expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable driven by higher sales and reductions in current compensation related accruals 
merchandise inventories increased approximately million  or  in fiscal from fiscal  consistent with our comparable sales increase and our increase in the number of stores 
on a per square foot basis  merchandise inventories remained flat at approximately at the end of both periods

other we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit at fdic insured financial institutions that are currently in excess of federally insured limits 
since the deposit insurance provisions of the dodd frank wall street reform act expired on december   and because our credit facility contains certain restrictions on permitted investments  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses with respect to cash on deposit 
we continually evaluate our deposit investment options in accordance with our corporate investment policy 

table of contents as of february   we had million invested in foreign bank accounts  of which the majority was held in canadian dollars 
as of january   we had million invested in foreign bank accounts 
as we continue to expand outside of the united states  we expect to continue to generate cash from non us operations 
we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds generated by the foreign subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
our intent is to indefinitely reinvest all of these funds outside of the united states  however  we will continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile  expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations 
we have a credit card program that offers eligible clients in the united states the choice of a private label or co branded credit card 
all cardholders are automatically enrolled in our exclusive rewards program  which is designed to recognize and promote client loyalty 
we provide the sponsoring bank with marketing support of the program  and use our sales force to process credit card applications for both the private label and co branded credit cards 
as part of the program  which began in october and has a year term  we received an upfront signing bonus from the sponsoring bank 
we also receive ongoing payments for new accounts activated  as well as a share of finance charges collected by the sponsoring bank 
these revenue streams are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and accordingly  are recognized as revenue ratably based on the total projected revenues over the term of the agreement 
certain judgments and estimates underlie our projected revenues and related expenses under the credit card program  including projected future store counts  the number of applications processed  our projected sales growth and points breakage  among other things 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recognized approximately million  million and million of revenue related to the credit card program  respectively 
at february   january  and january   approximately million  million and million  respectively  of deferred credit card income is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
partially offsetting the income from the credit card program are costs  net of points breakage  related to the client loyalty program

the cost of sales impact  net of points breakage  was approximately million  million and million and the sales discount impact was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
on october   we froze our non contributory defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
as a result of the freeze  only those associates who were eligible under the pension plan on or before september  substantially all associates of the company who completed  hours of service during a consecutive month period prior to that date are eligible to receive benefits from the pension plan once they have completed the five years of service required to become fully vested 
no associate may become a participant in the pension plan on or after october  and no additional benefits have been earned under the pension plan since october  our funding obligations and liability under the terms of the pension plan are determined using certain actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate and an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for pension benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the discount rate selected was based on a yield curve which uses expected cash flows from the pension plan and then discounts those cash flows with the bond rate for that period 
this resulted in a discount rate of 
a one percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for fiscal by million and would increase the liability for pension benefits at february  by million 
a one percent increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total net periodic pension expense for fiscal by million and would decrease the liability for pension benefits at february  by million 
pension plan assets as of february  were allocated in equities  and in bond related funds 
for the purposes of developing long term rates of return  it was assumed that the short term investments were reallocated to equities and bond related funds  yielding assumed long term rates of return of and  respectively 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets was and for fiscal and fiscal a one percent change in the long term rate of return assumption would impact fiscal pension expense by approximately million 

table of contents pension costs  excluding settlement charges  in fiscal were million higher than fiscal due to a lower discount rate and a lower expected rate of return 
pension costs in fiscal were million lower than pension costs in fiscal as a result of our pension plan assets experiencing gains in fiscal due to the large amount of lump sum distributions in  pension expense for fiscal  excluding any potential settlement charges  is projected to be approximately million  or million lower than pension expense  excluding settlement charges  in fiscal our pension plan is invested in readily liquid investments  primarily equity and debt securities 
although we were not required to make a contribution to the pension plan in fiscal or fiscal  any deterioration in the financial markets or changes in discount rates may require us to make a contribution to our pension plan in fiscal in fiscal  we initiated a communication to certain eligible pension plan participants with vested benefits to elect a lump sum distribution 
as a result of this effort  we made million in lump sum distribution payments  which resulted in a million pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  since the total amount of lump sum pension distribution payments made to pension plan participants in the normal course of business exceeded the interest component of pension expense during fiscal and fiscal  we recognized additional non cash settlement charges of million in both fiscal years 
all such pension plan settlement charges were included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
there were no such settlement charges in fiscal we are self insured for expenses related to our employee point of service medical plan  our workers compensation plan  general liability plan and for short term and long term disability  up to certain thresholds 
claims filed  as well as claims incurred but not reported  are accrued based on management s estimates  using information received from plan administrators  third party actuaries  historical analysis and other relevant data 
we believe we have taken reasonable steps to ensure that we are adequately accrued for incurred costs related to these programs at february  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations  some of which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets if the related goods or services were received prior to february  other items  such as leases  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations represent future liabilities and may not be recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets

in addition  as discussed in note  retirement plans  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have a long term liability for our pension plan 
minimum pension funding requirements are not included in the table above as such amounts are not readily determinable 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu amended asc  comprehensive income  and requires that all changes in comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  and also requires the presentation of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which indefinitely deferred the requirement of asu related to presentation of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which sets forth additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into net income that will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted asu  as modified by asu  in the first quarter of fiscal  by presenting separate but consecutive statements 
see the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
we will adopt the disclosures required by asu in the first quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
based on the above  we have determined that our most critical accounting policies are those related to merchandise inventory valuation  asset impairment  income taxes and stock and incentive based compensation 
these policies are also discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in relevant sections of this discussion and analysis 

table of contents merchandise inventory valuation merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  at the individual item level 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
merchandise inventory levels are monitored to identify slow moving items and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and markdowns are used to clear such merchandise 
a reserve is established to account for situations where the current selling price or future estimated selling price is less than cost 
physical inventory counts are performed annually in january and estimates are made for any shortage between the date of the physical inventory count and the balance sheet date 
asset impairment long lived tangible assets are accounted for under asc  property  plant  and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net asset balances through future cash flows is in question 
management estimates future pre tax cash flows at a store level undiscounted and without interest charges based on historical experience  knowledge and market data 
estimates of future cash flows require that we make assumptions and apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets 
these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results  real estate demand  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict  as well as other factors such as those outlined in risk factors 
if the expected future cash flows related to the long lived assets are less than the assets carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets relating to certain tax credits in non us jurisdictions  since we anticipate that it is not more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future earnings  taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax 
the tax effects of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if they are more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits as of the reporting date 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize estimated accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
we are currently under examination by certain state and local taxing jurisdictions 
further  at any given time  multiple tax years may be subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
the recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon examination  changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates 
while no adjustments to recorded amounts are anticipated  a variance in our effective tax rate would affect net income after taxes by approximately million in fiscal stock and incentive based compensation the calculation of stock based compensation expense requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based awards  stock price volatility and pre vesting forfeitures 
we estimate the expected life of shares granted in connection with stock based awards using historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on an average of our historical volatility and the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  if the latter is available 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of stock based awards granted  exercised and cancelled  as well as future expected behavior 
similarly  the calculation of long term performance compensation expense related to our restricted cash program rcp requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected forfeiture of earned and banked awards and forecasts of our future income growth 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical rcp forfeiture patterns  as well as current and future trends of expected behavior 
we estimate future income growth based on past performance  future business trends and new business initiatives 

table of contents the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of stock based awards and long term performance compensation expense represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we were to use different assumptions  the expense recorded could be materially different 
for stock based awards  if we were to adjust our forfeiture rate estimates by  the impact to stock based compensation cost would be approximately million 
similarly  if we were to adjust rcp forfeiture rate estimates by  the impact to long term incentive compensation expense would be approximately million 
finally  if we were to adjust the interest rate factors applied to amounts banked under the rcp by five percentage points  the impact to long term incentive compensation expense would be approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit at fdic insured financial institutions that are currently in excess of federally insured limits 
since the deposit insurance provisions of the dodd frank wall street reform act expired on december   and because our credit facility contains certain restrictions on permitted investments  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses with respect to cash on deposit in excess of federally insured limits 
we continually evaluate our deposit investment options in accordance with our corporate investment policy 
we are exposed to limited market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange 
we have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to certain revenues and costs denominated in the canadian dollar 
as of february   our monetary assets and liabilities that are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore  the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
anntaylor inc s credit facility allows for investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of up to days 
as of february   we did not hold any investments that did not qualify as cash and cash equivalents
