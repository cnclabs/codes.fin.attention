item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we operate two primary businesses the infospace online search business and the taxact tax preparation software and online service business 
the infospace business is primarily a bb service that provides search technology  aggregated search content  and monetization solutions to partner sites 
infospace also offers search services directly to consumers through its owned internet search properties 
blucora acquired the taxact tax preparation business on january  the taxact business consists of an online tax preparation service for individuals  tax preparation software for individuals and professional tax preparers  and ancillary services 
following the acquisition of the taxact business  we determined that we have two reporting segments search and tax preparation 
search the majority of the blucora s revenues are generated by our search segment 
our search business primarily offers search services through the web properties of its distribution partners  which are generally private labeled and customized to address the unique requirements of each distribution partner 
the search business also distributes aggregated search content through its own websites  such as dogpile 
com and webcrawler 
com 
the infospace search business does not generate its own search content  but instead aggregates search content from a number of content providers 
our metasearch technology selects search results from several search engine content providers  including google  yahoo  and bing  among others  and aggregates  filters  and prioritizes the results 
this combination provides a more relevant search results page and leverages the investments made by our search engine content providers to continually improve the user experience 
some of these content providers  such as google and yahoo  pay us to distribute their content 
we refer to those providers as search customers 
revenue from our search segment is generated primarily as a result of end users of our services clicking on paid search results displayed on our own branded websites or those of our distribution partners 
these paid search results are provided to us by our search customers 
the search customer that provided the paid search result receives a fee from the advertiser who paid for the click and the search customer pays us a portion of that fee 
if the click originated from one of our distribution partners web properties  we share a portion of the fee we receive with that distribution partner 
revenue is recognized in the period in which such paid clicks occur and is based on the amounts earned and remitted to us by our search customers for such clicks 
for the year ended december   revenue from google accounted for approximately of our search segment revenue and of our total revenue 
tax preparation on january   we acquired taxact holdings and its subsidiary  nd story  operator of the taxact income tax preparation business for million in cash  less certain transaction expenses  and subject to certain specified working capital adjustments 
the taxact business consists of tax preparation software for individuals and professional tax preparers  an online tax preparation service for individuals  and ancillary data storage and financial services 
the taxact acquisition was funded from our cash reserves and from the net proceeds of a million credit facility of which million was drawn 
our tax preparation segment generates revenue primarily in three ways the sale of state and upgraded online federal income tax preparation services and software to consumers and small businesses  the sale of ancillary services to consumers  and the sale of its professional edition income tax preparation software to professional tax preparers 
the majority of our tax preparation revenue is generated by our online service at www 
taxact 
com and  as a highly seasonal business  almost all of that revenue is generated in the first four 
table of contents months of the calendar year 
our basic federal tax preparation online software service is free for everyone  meaning that any taxpayer can use the services to e file his or her federal income return  including all forms that the irs allows to be e filed  without paying for upgraded services 
this free offer differentiates taxact s offerings from many of its competitors who have limited free software and or services offerings or limitations on the forms that may be e filed for free 
we generate revenue from a percentage of these free users who choose to upgrade for a fee to our deluxe product  which includes additional support and tools  and ancillary services and or to file their state income tax returns  which are not free  with taxact 
the ancillary services include  among other things  taxpayer phone support  data archiving  a deferred payment option  a bank card product  and e filing services for professional tax preparers 
taxact is the recognized value player in the digital do it yourself space  offering comparable software and or services at a lower cost to the end user compared to larger competitors 
this  coupled with its free for everyone offer  provides taxact a valuable marketing position 
taxact s professional tax preparer software allows professional tax preparers to file individual returns for their clients 
revenue from professional tax preparers has historically constituted a relatively small percentage of the taxact business s overall revenue  and requires relatively modest incremental development costs as the basic software is substantially similar to the consumer facing software and online service 
use of cash as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we may purchase up to million of our common stock in open market transactions in the month period succeeding february   which was the date that our board of directors approved the share repurchase plan 
we may also use these amounts in the future on investment in our current businesses  in acquiring new businesses or assets  or for repayment of debt 
such businesses or assets may not be related to search or tax preparation  and such acquisitions will result in us incurring further transaction related costs 
we are currently focused on the following areas improving the search services offered to our end users and to our distribution partners and through our owned and operated properties  improving the customer experience for our tax preparation products  maintaining our current distribution partners and adding new distribution partners for our search services  retaining current tax preparation customers and attracting new ones  and seeking opportunities to use our resources to acquire and integrate new businesses and assets 
within our search and tax preparation businesses  engineering  operations  and product management personnel remain paramount to our ability to deliver high quality search and tax preparation services  enhance our current technology  and increase our distribution network and customer reach 
as a result  we expect to continue to invest in our workforce and research and development operations 
overview of operating results the following is an overview of our operating results for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
a more detailed discussion of our operating results  comparing our operating results for the years ended december    and  is included under the heading historical results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

table of contents historical results of operations the following table sets forth the historical results of our operations in thousands and as percent of revenues

segment expenses do not include certain costs such as certain general  administrative  and overhead costs  stock based compensation  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  other loss  net  income tax expense  or results from discontinued operations to the reportable segments 
search search segment results for the years   and are presented below in thousands change change revenue cost of revenue operating expense segment income in order to increase the revenue generated from our distribution partners web properties  we must attract and retain distribution partners 
our ability to attract and retain distribution partners depends to a significant extent on our ability to provide a satisfying end user experience and an attractive monetization proposition to our distribution partners 
traffic to our owned and operated search properties has declined in recent years  and our ability to slow this decline and the resulting decline in the revenue generated by our owned and operated search 
table of contents properties depends in part on the extent to which we are able to attract and retain end users by providing a satisfying user experience 
we manage our online direct marketing initiatives by seeking a margin and volume mix that optimizes the gross dollar return on our marketing expenditures 
revenue growth for our online direct marketing initiatives is dependent on our ability to attain that optimal return 
the increase in search services revenues for as compared to was due to increases in revenue generated by our distribution partners  which was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our owned and operated web properties 
revenue from existing distributions partners ie  distribution partners launched before the then current year increased in as compared to by million and revenue from new distribution partners ie  distribution partners launched during the then current year in as compared to increased by million 
while we expect to continue year over year growth  our most significant search customer  google  has instituted policy changes that will have a negative impact in the near term to certain of our distribution partners 
we believe the impacts will be most pronounced in the late first quarter and carry into the second quarter  after which point we expect to be begin to grow distribution sequentially in the second half of the year 
the decrease of million in revenue generated by our owned and operated properties for as compared to was primarily a result of the expected attrition in the installed user base from our acquisition of make the web better  resulting in fewer paid clicks 
we generated of our search services revenue through our top five distribution partners in both and the web properties of our top five distribution partners for generated of our search services revenue in the increase in search services revenues for as compared to was due to increases in revenue generated by our distribution partners  which was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our owned and operated web properties 
revenue from existing distribution partners increased in as compared to by million and revenue from new distribution partners in as compared to increased by million  but these trends were offset by a decline of million from existing distribution partner make the web better as we acquired its search services revenue generating assets on april  the decrease of million in revenue generated by our owned and operated properties for as compared to was primarily due to the operation of the acquired make the web better assets  which generated million of revenue as an owned and operated web property in  down from million in there was also a decrease in revenue of million from our revenue generated through our owned and operated metasearch engine site  excluding the revenue from the make the web better purchased assets 
for  of our search services revenue was generated through our search distribution partners web properties  compared to and of our search services revenue  respectively  generated through our search distribution partners web properties in and we expect that search services revenue from searches conducted by end users on sites of our distribution partners will continue to represent the dominant majority of our search services revenue for the foreseeable future 
our owned and operated properties are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage  which generally decline in the summer months  although revenue from these sites makes up a proportionally smaller portion of our revenue  so seasonal impacts have become less meaningful  and are expected to become a smaller portion over time 
the search segment s cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid under our revenue sharing arrangements with our distribution partners and usage based content fees 
the increase in cost of revenue for as compared to is primarily due to an increase in the revenue generated from our distribution partners web properties  with the resulting increase in shared revenue 
the dollar increase in cost of revenue for as compared to was primarily due to the increase in revenue sharing expenses related to an increase in revenue generated through the web properties of our distribution partners  and was partially offset by the effect of no longer paying distribution expense for revenue generated by make the web better s assets after we acquired them on april   by the decrease in the 
table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets acquired from make the web better  and by the decline in cost of revenue for our haggle business  which was suspended in the search segment s cost of revenue will increase if search services revenue generated through our distribution partners web properties increases at a greater rate than revenue generated through our owned and operated web properties 
in addition  cost of revenue from distribution can be impacted by the mix of revenue generated by distribution partners 
we expect that revenue from searches conducted by end users on sites of our distribution partners will continue to be an increasing majority of our search services revenue 
the decrease in search segment operating expense for as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in professional service fees and business taxes 
the decrease in search segment operating expense for as compared to was primarily due to decreases in our direct marketing initiatives associated with traffic acquisition to our owned and operated metasearch engine sites  software license costs  and personnel costs 
tax preparation tax preparation segment results for the years is presented below in thousands revenue cost of revenue operating expense segment income the tax preparation segment was new in due to our acquisition of the taxact business on january  unless otherwise indicated  figures in this annual report reflect the results from the date of the acquisition through december  our ability to generate tax preparation revenue is dependent on our ability to effectively market our consumer tax preparation software and online services and our ability to sell the related deluxe and ancillary services to our customers 
we also generate revenue through the professional tax preparer software that we sell to professional tax preparers  who use it to prepare and file individual returns for their clients 
revenue from professional tax preparers has historically constituted a relatively small percentage of the overall revenue for the taxact business 
consumer tax preparation revenue is largely driven by our ability to acquire new users of the service  retain existing users  and upsell users to paid products and services 
we measure our individual tax preparation customers using the number of accepted federal tax e filings made through our software and services  and we refer to such tax filings as e files 
we consider growth in the number of e files to be the most important non financial metric in measuring the performance of the tax preparation business 
overall revenue is driven more by growth in e files than by growth in revenue per user  which has historically grown modestly  because we have not made significant pricing adjustments 
because we acquired the taxact business during the course of the tax season  we believe that presenting e file metrics covering the same time periods as the financial results presented and comparable period would not accurately reflect segment results of operations 
accordingly  we are presenting these metrics for e filings made during each tax season s filing year though the end of the calendar year as follows in thousands e filings during the calendar year in thousands change total taxact consumer e files 
table of contents we derive revenue from the professional tax preparation product in two ways from the per unit licensing of the software and from amounts that we charge to e file through the software 
thus professional tax preparation revenue is dependent upon both the number of tax professionals purchasing the product and the number of e filed returns submitted through this product 
for the tax season  the number of tax professional units sold grew modestly compared to the prior year and the number of e filed returns grew in excess of 
we believe that these trends were impacted by new irs requirements regarding professional tax preparers qualifications  which limited the unit sales growth by reducing the total number of preparers  and by new irs e file requirements for professional tax preparers  which accelerated e file growth 
as a result  the current year trends may not be indicative of future performance

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in data center asset depreciation of million 
the dollar increase in cost of sales for as compared to was primarily due to the increase in revenue sharing expenses related to an increase in revenue generated through the web properties of our distribution partners  and was partially offset by the effect of no longer paying distribution expense for revenue generated by make the web better s assets after we acquired them on april   by the decrease in the amortization of acquired intangible assets acquired from make the web better  and by the decline in cost of sales for our haggle business  after we suspended its operations in engineering and technology expenses

we believe that adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance 
we use this non gaap financial measure for internal management and compensation purposes  when publicly providing guidance on possible future results  and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate our performance  that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting our business when viewed together with gaap results  and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non gaap financial measure 
items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant and necessary components to the operations of our business and  therefore  adjusted ebitda should be considered as a supplement to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  gaap net income 
other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently and  therefore  our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled

non cash income tax expense represents a reduction to cash taxes payable associated with the utilization of deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of us federal net operating losses 
the majority of these deferred tax assets will expire in if unutilized 
we believe that non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share provide meaningful supplemental information to management  investors  and analysts regarding our performance and the valuation of our business by excluding items in the statement of operations that we do not consider part of our ongoing operations or have not been  or are not expected to be  settled in cash 
additionally  we believe non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share are common measures used by investors and analysts to evaluate our performance and the valuation of our business 
non gaap net income should be evaluated in light of our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap  and should be considered as a supplement to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  gaap net income 
other companies may calculate non gaap net income differently  and therefore our non gaap net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as the disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingencies 
in some cases  we could have reasonably used different accounting policies and estimates 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to revenue recognition  cost of sales  impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  accounting for business combinations  stock based compensation  and the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and  based on information available to us at that time  we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identify and assess our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments  or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we also have other accounting policies that involve the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions and that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
search services revenue recognition our revenues are generated primarily from our web search services 
we generate search services revenue when an end user of such services clicks on a paid search link provided by a search customer and displayed on a distribution partners web property or on one of our owned and operated web properties 
the search customer that provided the paid search link receives a fee from the advertiser who paid for the click and the search customer pays us a portion of that fee 
revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are provided eg  a paid search occurs and is based on the amounts earned by and ultimately remitted to us 
we record this revenue in our search segment 
under our agreements with our search customers and our distribution partners  we are the primary obligor  separately negotiate each revenue or unit pricing contract independent of any revenue sharing arrangements  and assume the credit risk for amounts invoiced to our search customers 
for search services  we determine the paid search results  content  and information directed to its owned and operated websites and its distribution partners web properties 
the company earns revenue from its search customers by providing paid search results generated from its owned and operated web properties and from its distribution partners web properties based on separately negotiated and agreed upon terms with each distribution partner 
consequently  the company records search services revenue on a gross basis 

table of contents tax preparation revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of tax preparation online services  ancillary service offerings  tax preparation packaged software products  and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items 
ancillary service offerings include tax preparation support services  data archive services  bank or reloadable pre paid debit card services  and e filing services 
we record this revenue in our tax preparation segment 
our tax preparation segment service revenue consists primarily of hosted tax preparation online services  tax preparation support services  data archive services  and e filing services 
we recognize revenue from these services as the services are performed and the revenue recognition criteria are met as described in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products when legal title transfers 
this is generally when its customers download products from the web or when the products ship 
the bank or reloadable prepaid debit card services are offered to taxpayers as an option to receive their tax refunds in the form of a prepaid bank card or to have the fees for the product and or services purchased by the customers deducted from their refunds 
revenue for this fee is recognized when the four revenue recognition criteria are met  for some arrangements that is upon filing and for other arrangements that is upon cash receipt 
for products and or services that consist of multiple elements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value if available  third party evidence tpe of fair value if vsoe is not available  and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  and allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method 
once we have allocated the total price among the various elements  we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
vsoe generally exists when we sell the deliverable separately and are normally able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in these multiple element arrangements  however  in certain limited instances vsoe cannot be established 
this may be because we infrequently sell each element separately  or have a limited sales history 
when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish a selling price for each element based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
esp is the estimated price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  historical stand alone sales  pricing practices  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  and gross margin objectives 
in some situations  we receive advance payments from our customers 
we defer revenue associated with these advance payments and recognize the allocated consideration for each element when we ship the products or perform the services  as appropriate 
advance payments related to data archive services are deferred and recognized over the related contractual term 
debt issuance costs and debt discount debt issuance costs and debt discounts are deferred and amortized as interest expense under the effective interest method over the contractual term of the related debt  adjusted for prepayments 

table of contents hedging we use a derivative financial instrument in the form of an interest rate swap agreement for the purpose of minimizing exposure to changes in interest rates 
this swap agreement is accounted for as a cash flow hedge and changes in the fair value of the hedge instrument are included in other comprehensive income 
cost of sales we record the cost of sales when the related revenue is recognized 
cost of sales consists of costs related to revenue sharing arrangements with our distribution partners  usage based content fees  certain costs associated with the operation of our data centers that serve our search and tax preparation businesses  including amortization of intangible assets  depreciation  personnel expenses which include salaries  benefits and other employee related costs  and stock based compensation expense  bandwidth costs  customer payment processing fees  bank service fees  and royalties 
business combinations and intangible assets including goodwill we account for business combinations using the acquisition method and  accordingly  the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
acquisition related costs  including advisory  legal  accounting  valuation  and other costs  are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred 
the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually on november  and evaluate all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  including material changes in the fair value of our outstanding common stock  indicate that the carrying amounts of any of those assets may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of goodwill  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if so  we perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount 
we determine the reporting unit fair values by using a combination of projections of future discounted cash flows and ebitda and revenue multiple comparisons with comparable publicly held companies 
if we determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over its fair value 
in the evaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying amount 
if so  we perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets  which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks  using the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
if we determined that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over its fair value 
as of november  and  the company had no impairments 

table of contents in the dynamic search and tax preparation software industries  there is significant uncertainty about the future 
unforeseen events such as market disruptions and deterioration of the macroeconomic environment  or internal challenges such as reorganizations  employee and management turnover  operational cash flows  and other trends that could have material negative impacts on our key assumptions in determining fair values  could lead to a decision to impair goodwill in future periods 
at december   we had million of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets and on our balance sheet 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  restricted stock unit grants  market stock unit grants  and a warrant  over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
during   and  we recognized million  million  and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense in continuing operations 
for further information regarding our stock plan activities and our methods of accounting for them  see note summary of significant accounting policies  note stockholders equity  and note stock based compensation expense of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
calculating stock based compensation expense relies upon certain assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based awards  expected stock price volatility  expected interest rate  number and types of stock based awards  and the pre vesting forfeiture rate 
if we use different assumptions due to changes in our business or other factors  our stock based compensation expense could vary materially in the future 
the stock based compensation expense for includes million fair value classified to general and administrative expenses for the warrant issued in august the acquisition of the taxact business on january  fulfilled the warrant s remaining performance condition and extended the warrant s expiration date 
the extension of the warrant s term was a modification that resulted in a million charge to stock based compensation expense equal to the increase in the warrant s fair value and was recognized in general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of additionally  subsequent to the modification  we treated the award as a derivative instrument  and the modification date fair value previously recognized in paid in capital was classified as a current liability 
the warrant s fair value will be determined each reporting period until settled  with gains or losses related to the change in fair value recorded in other loss income  net 
we recorded a loss in other loss income  net of million from derivative instruments relating to the warrant in the year ended december  we recorded million in total expense relating to the modification and change in fair value for the warrant for the year ended december  income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
there is a wide range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

table of contents during the year ended december   we provided a full valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  based on the weight of available evidence  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize million of our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
accordingly we released the valuation allowance against this portion of our deferred tax assets and retained the valuation allowance against the remainder at year end 
during the year ended december   we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets

recent accounting pronouncements changes to gaap are established by the financial accounting standards board fasb in the form of accounting standards updates asus to the fasb s accounting standards codification 
we consider the applicability and impact of all recent asus 
asus not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued an asu to simplify how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment to improve consistency in impairment testing requirements among long lived asset categories 
the asu permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
for assets for which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  this asu eliminates the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards 
we early adopted the new standard on october  the adoption of this asu did not materially impact our consolidated condensed financial statements 
events subsequent to december  on january   we completed a million equity investment in a privately owned company 
on february   our board of directors approved a plan whereby we may repurchase up to million of our common stock in open market transactions during the succeeding month period 
repurchased shares will be retired and resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in the market values of our debt investments and interest rates 
financial market risk 
we do not invest in financial instruments or their derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
by policy  we limit our credit exposure to any one issuer  other than securities issued by the us federal government and its agencies  and do not have any derivative instruments in our investment portfolio 
the three primary goals that guide our investment decisions  with the first being the most important  are preserve capital  maintain ease of conversion into immediate liquidity  and achieve a rate of return over a predetermined benchmark 
our investment portfolio at december  included debt instruments issued by the us federal government and its agencies  publicly held corporations  municipalities  insured time deposits with commercial banks  and money market funds invested in securities issued by agencies of the us federal government 
as of december   we invested exclusively in debt instruments with minimal default risk and maturity dates of less than one year from the end of any of our quarterly accounting periods 
we consider the market value  default  and liquidity risks of our investments to be low at december  interest rate risk 
as of december   all of the debt securities that we held were fixed rate earning instruments that carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   our cash equivalent balances of million were primarily held in money market funds and taxable municipal bonds  and our short term investment balances of million were primarily held in us government securities and taxable municipal bonds 
we consider the interest rate risk for our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities held at december  to be low 
for further detail on our cash equivalent and short term investment holdings  please see note fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
in addition  as of december   we have million of term debt outstanding  which carries a degree of interest rate risk 
the debt has a floating portion of its interest rate  tied to the london interbank offered rate libor 
to maintain compliance with our debt agreement  we entered into an interest rate swap 
for further information on our swap and debt outstanding see note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
that interest rate swap mitigated about half of our risk of increasing libor rates  while the other half remains unhedged 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor on december  would result in a million increase in our interest expense until the scheduled maturity date on january   partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our swap of million on december  the following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities  including principal cash flows for and thereafter and the related weighted average interest rates
