overview significant events summary significant events affecting include completed the homeward acquisition on december th o acquired approximately  residential loans with upb of approximately billion  including approximately billion of servicing deals and billion of subservicing deals 
o acquired homeward s existing loan origination platform 
o paid an aggregate purchase price of  of which  was paid in cash and  was paid in preferred shares 
o issued a  incremental term loan pursuant to our existing sstl facility and borrowed  from altisource pursuant to a new senior unsecured loan agreement 
o acquired total assets of billion  including billion of servicing advances   of msrs and  of loans held for sale 
also recognized goodwill of  associated with the acquisition 
o assumed liabilities of billion  primarily representing borrowings under advance financing facilities of billion 
o repaid the  outstanding balance of homeward s sstl and revolving line of credit that we assumed in the homeward acquisition  completed msr asset acquisitions of  on servicing portfolios totaling approximately  loans and billion of upb 
we issued notes with a combined maximum borrowing capacity of billion under two new advance financing facilities in connection with the financing of advances that we acquired as part of the saxon msr transaction 
in connection with the acquisition of msrs from bana in june  we issued notes with a maximum borrowing capacity of  under a new advance funding facility and issued a new promissory note to finance the msrs 
completed sales to hlss of rights to msrs for loans with approximately billion of upb together with the related servicing advances 
the effects of the hlss transactions on include o improved liquidity and cash flows as the sales resulted in net cash proceeds to ocwen of billion  of which billion was used to repay match funded liabilities and  was used to reduce the balance on the sstl 
we also used a portion of the proceeds from the december sale to fund a portion of the homeward purchase price consideration 
o decreased match funded advances  as  was transferred to hlss as part of the initial sale of the homeq servicing advance spe and billion was sold in connection with the subsequent flow sales 
o decreased match funded liabilities  as hlss assumed the remaining  balance of the homeq servicing advance facility from ocwen in the initial sale and ocwen used billion of the proceeds from the subsequent flow sales to repay the match funded debt related to the sold advances 
as a result of the december sale  we fully repaid the balance outstanding under the litton advance facility 
o accounted for the transactions as financings until the required third party consents are obtained and legal ownership of the msrs transfers to hlss 
ocwen has initially sold rights to msrs to hlss rather than the msrs 
as a result  the msrs remain on our balance sheet and continue to be amortized  and we have recognized a financing liability 
the amount of servicing revenues recognized is unchanged as a result of the hlss transactions 
hlss purchased the rights to msrs for  more than ocwen s carrying value at the date of sale 
this amount will be realized over time as the msrs amortize 
o increased interest expense because the interest on the portion of the sales proceeds accounted for as a financing is greater than the interest on the match funded liabilities that were assumed by hlss or repaid principally because ocwen is also compensating hlss for the cost of capital used to fund the transactions 
o realized a portion of our deferred tax asset related to the rights to msrs that we sold to hlss 
redeemed the remaining  balance of convertible notes due and issued  shares of common stock upon conversion 
redeemed the remaining  balance of capital securities due at a price of of the outstanding principal 
formed oms under the laws of the usvi as part of an initiative to consolidate the ownership and management of all of our global servicing assets and operations under a single entity and cost effectively expand our us based servicing activities 
we anticipate that these changes will streamline global operations and lower our effective international tax rate on existing assets  and we began to see the initial effect of these changes in the fourth quarter of operations summary the residential msr acquisitions during  the litton acquisition on september  and the homeq acquisition on september  have significantly impacted our consolidated operating results for the past three years 
the homeward acquisition closed on december   and therefore did not have a significant impact on operating results for the operating results of the homeward  litton loan servicing and homeq servicing businesses are included in our operating results since their respective acquisition dates

the homeward acquisition closed on december   and therefore did not have a significant impact on revenues 
operating expenses for increased principally because of the effects of growth in the servicing portfolio which resulted in a substantial increase in staffing and higher amortization of msrs 
newly acquired servicing portfolios typically have higher delinquencies upon boarding which raises costs relative to increases in upb 
this disproportionate increase in costs results because we incur our highest expenses up front as we invest in loss mitigation resources and incur transaction related costs 
however  the effects of the increase in staffing on compensation and benefits were offset in part by the nonrecurring expenses associated with the operations of litton loan servicing immediately after the litton acquisition 
technology and occupancy costs have increased as well  as we have added facilities and infrastructure to support the growth 
operating expenses for also include a charge of  to establish a liability for the remaining lease payments on the former litton facility that we vacated in march 
we also incurred a fee of  in the first quarter of as a result of cancelling a planned  upsizing of the sstl facility 
nevertheless  income from operations increased by  or  for as compared to other expense  net increased by  primarily due to a  increase in interest expense 
higher interest on borrowings related to the litton acquisition and the msr acquisitions that closed during were partially offset by a decline in interest expense on borrowings related to the homeq advance facility transferred to hlss in march and on match funded and sstl borrowings repaid with proceeds from the hlss transactions 
losses on extinguishment of debt were  in as compared to gains of  in in addition  we recognized a loss of  in on the deconsolidation of the four loan securitization trusts that we began consolidating in partially offsetting these increases in other expense  net was a  decline in losses on derivatives 
versus servicing and subservicing fees were higher in as a result of loan modifications and the growth in the average servicing portfolio that included approximately billion acquired on september  related to the litton acquisition and the effect of the homeq portfolio for a full year in as compared to four months in operating expenses increased slightly in higher amortization of msrs and the effects of a substantial increase in staffing to service the larger portfolio were largely offset by lower non recurring expenses related to the litton acquisition as compared to those incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition in and a decline in litigation related expenses 
non recurring expenses related to the litton acquisition were  in versus  for the homeq acquisition in in addition  litigation related expenses were higher during due to  of litigation expense incurred in connection with the adverse verdict in a vendor dispute and the settlement of the mdl proceeding 
income from operations increased by  or  in as compared to other expense  net increased by  primarily due to an increase of  in interest expense on borrowings related to the homeq and litton acquisitions  including the write off of  of unamortized discount and deferred debt issuance costs as the result of the prepayment of  on the  sstl 
also increasing other expense  net in was  of losses on derivatives  including  of unrealized losses on foreign exchange forward contracts that we entered into to hedge against the effects of changes in the value of the indian rupee 
also  included  of gains related to affordable housing investments that we sold 
these factors contributing to the increases in other expense  net in were partly offset by  of gains on extinguishment of debt in and the effects of  of realized and unrealized losses on auction rate securities and a  write off of a commercial real estate investment in income tax expense recognized in was reduced by the release of a reserve predominantly related to deductions associated with a servicing advance finance structure and statute expirations 
the reserve for this item was recorded in change in financial condition summary during  our balance sheet was significantly impacted by the homeward acquisition  by the msr acquisitions and by the hlss transactions

the increase in goodwill is the result of goodwill recorded as part of the homeward acquisition 
reductions in match funded liabilities as a result of the sale and transfer of advances to hlss and the collection of advances more than offset borrowings to fund the msrs and advances acquired and borrowings assumed from homeward 
lines of credit and other borrowings increased as liabilities resulting from the sales of msrs to hlss accounted for as financings and new borrowings related to the homeward acquisition exceeded repayments on the sstl including required prepayments from the proceeds received from the hlss transactions 
debt securities were reduced to zero as a result of converting the remaining principal balance of the convertible notes and redeeming the capital securities 
mezzanine equity results from the issuance of  of the preferred shares in connection with the homeward acquisition 
total stockholders equity increased primarily due to net income of  and  of additional equity resulting from the conversion of the convertible notes to  shares of common stock in march 
the exercise of stock options and the recognition of compensation related to employee share based awards also contributed to the increase in equity in liquidity summary we meet our financing requirements using a combination of debt and equity capital 
our short term financing needs arise primarily from our holding of mortgage loans pending sale and our obligations to advance certain payments on behalf of delinquent mortgage borrowers 
our long term financing needs arise primarily from our investments in msrs and the financial instruments acquired to manage the interest rate risk associated with those investments  and from investments that we make in technology and other capital expenditures 
the structure and mix of our debt and equity capital are primarily driven by our strategic objectives but are also influenced by our credit ratings and market conditions 
such ratings and market conditions affect the type of financing we are able to obtain and the rate at which we are able to grow 
we primarily rely on secured borrowings as the key component of our financing strategy 
our financing arrangements allow us to fund a portion of our servicing advances until they are recovered and to fund our loan originations on a short term basis until the mortgage loans are sold to secondary market investors 
see note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the components of our debt 
we define liquidity as unencumbered cash balances plus unused  collateralized advance financing capacity 
our liquidity as of december   as measured by cash and available credit  was  a decrease of  or  from december  at december   our cash position was  compared to  at december  we had no available credit on collateralized but unused advance financing capacity at december  compared to  at december  available credit was reduced to zero because we borrowed the maximum amount  given the available collateral  principally in order to support the homeward acquisition 
during  we used billion of the proceeds from our sales to hlss of rights to msrs and related advances to pay down our borrowing under the sstl and the advance financing facilities 
we repaid in full the borrowings under three of our advance financing facilities and terminated these facilities in and hlss assumed a fourth facility 
we regularly monitor and project cash flow to minimize liquidity risk 
in assessing our liquidity outlook  our primary focus is on maintaining cash and unused borrowing capacity that is sufficient to meet the needs of the business 
our investment policies emphasize principal preservation by limiting investments to include securities issued by the us government  a us agency or a us gse money market mutual funds money market demand deposits demand deposit accounts at december   billion of our maximum advance borrowing capacity remained unused 
however  as noted above  the amount of collateral pledged to these facilities limit additional borrowing  and at the end of the year none of the unused borrowing capacity was readily available 
we may utilize the unused borrowing capacity in the servicing business in the future by pledging additional qualifying collateral to these facilities 
in order to reduce fees charged by lenders which we recognize as interest expense  we limit unused borrowing capacity to a level that we consider prudent relative to the current levels of advances and match funded advances and to our anticipated funding needs for reasonably foreseeable changes in advances 
interest rate risk summary interest rate risk is a function of i the timing of re pricing and ii the dollar amount of assets and liabilities that re price at various times 
we are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest rate sensitive liabilities mature or re price at different speeds  or on different bases  than interest earning assets 
in executing our hedging strategy for the servicing business  we have attempted to neutralize the effect of increases in interest rates within a certain period on the interest paid on our variable rate advance financing debt 
we determine our hedging needs based on the projected excess of variable rate debt over cash and float balances since the earnings on cash and float balances are a partial offset to our exposure to changes in interest expense 
as of december   the notional amount of our outstanding swaps  excluding two forward swaps starting in june  was greater than total outstanding variable rate debt excluding our sstl and net of cash and float balances 
our excess swap positions do not currently affect our application of hedge accounting because a significant portion of our swaps are not designated to any hedging relationship and our hedging relationships do not consider cash and float balances 
we also purchased interest rate caps as economic hedges not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes to minimize future interest rate exposure from increases in one month libor interest rates  as required by certain of our advance financing arrangements 
our current hedging strategy principally focuses on variable rate advance and msr financing debt 
the interest rate on our variable rate sstl is not currently part of our hedging strategy because it is considered essentially fixed as interest is computed using a month libor floor of that is well above month libor which averaged during during the coming two years  our variable rate advance and msr financing debt is projected to exceed the notional amount of our current swaps 
future variances between the projected excess of variable rate debt over cash and float balances and actual results could result in our becoming over hedged or under hedged 
also  the msrs which we acquired from homeward that are measured at fair value are subject to substantial interest rate risk as the mortgage notes underlying the servicing rights permit the borrowers to prepay the loans 
therefore  the value of these msrs generally tends to diminish in periods of declining interest rates as prepayments increase and increase in periods of rising interest rates as prepayments decrease 
we enter into economic hedges including interest rate swaps  us treasury futures and forward contracts to minimize the effects of loss in value of the msrs associated with increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
in our lending business acquired from homeward  we are subject to interest rate and price risk on mortgage loans held for sale from the loan funding date until the date the loan is sold into the secondary market 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward trades to provide an economic hedge against changes in fair value on mortgage loans held for sale 
irlcs  or loan commitments  bind us subject to the loan approval process to fund the loan at the specified rate  regardless of whether interest rates have changed between the commitment date and the loan funding date 
as such  outstanding irlcs are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of the commitment through the loan funding date or expiration date 
our interest rate exposure on these derivative loan commitments is hedged with freestanding derivatives such as forward contracts 
we enter into forward contracts with respect to fixed rate loan commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our use of derivatives 
critical accounting policies our ability to measure and report our operating results and financial position is heavily influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of future events 
our critical accounting policies relate to the estimation and measurement of these risks 
because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties  an understanding of these policies is fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the following is a summary of our more subjective and complex accounting policies as they relate to our overall business strategy 
valuation and amortization of residential mortgage servicing rights our most significant business is our residential servicing business 
msrs are an intangible asset that represents the right to service a portfolio of mortgage loans 
we generally obtain msrs through asset acquisitions or business combinations 
all newly acquired msrs are initially measured at fair value 
subsequent to acquisition  we account for msrs using the amortization method or the fair value measurement method  based on our strategy for managing the risks of the underlying portfolios 
the determination of fair value of msrs requires management judgment because they are not actively traded 
amortized cost msrs for msrs that we account for using the amortization method  we amortize the balance of servicing assets or liabilities in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and assess servicing assets or liabilities for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date 
we determine estimated net servicing income using the estimated future balance of the underlying mortgage loan portfolio  which  absent new purchases  declines over time from prepayments and scheduled loan amortization 
we adjust amortization prospectively in response to changes in projections of future cash flows 
we estimate the fair value of our msrs carried at amortized cost by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing assumptions that we believe are used by market participants 
the significant components of the estimated future cash flows for msrs include rate at which upb declines interest rate used for computing the cost of servicing advances servicing fees and ancillary income delinquencies cost of servicing interest rate used for computing float earnings discount rate compensating interest expense we also generate internal valuations for management purposes that use the same inputs but reference our historical experience rather than assumptions based on the experience of other industry participants 
we group the loans that we service into strata based on one or more of the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the risk factors used to assign loans to strata include the credit score fico of the borrower  the loan to value ratio and the default risk 
our primary strata include subprime alt a high loan to value the following table provides the range of prepayment speed and delinquency assumptions expressed as a percentage of upb by stratum projected for the five year period beginning december  prepayment speed delinquency subprime alt a high loan to value other assumptions we used to estimate the fair value of msrs by stratum as of december  include the cost of financing advances month libor plus a range of to  float earnings a range of month libor to  a discount rate approximately and the cost of servicing representing industry averages  which vary by stratum and ranged from in dollars per year for a performing loan to  in dollars per year for a loan in foreclosure 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as follows increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of our msrs as the underlying loans prepay faster which causes accelerated msr amortization  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by a lower overall cost of servicing  increased float earnings on higher float balances and lower interest expense on decreased servicing advance balances 
increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of our msrs as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period  and the amounts of servicing advances and related interest expense also increase 
increases in the discount rate reduce the value of our msrs due to the lower overall net present value of the net cash flows 
increases in interest rate assumptions will increase interest expense for financing servicing advances although this effect is partially offset because rate increases will also increase the amount of float earnings that we recognize 
we perform an impairment analysis of our msrs by stratum based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value 
to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount for any stratum  we recognize an impairment valuation allowance 
fair value msrs for msrs that we account for using the fair value measurement method  we measure the servicing assets or liabilities at fair value with all changes in fair value recorded as a charge or credit to earnings 
this portfolio comprises servicing rights for prime mortgage loans acquired by homeward through asset or flow purchases or retained on loans originated and subsequently sold 
changes in the fair value of msrs carried at fair value are reported in the period in which the change occurs 
we estimate the fair value of our msrs carried at fair value by using a process that combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of these msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds  delinquency rates and discount rates 
the assumptions used in the december  valuation include a weighted average constant prepayment rate of and a discount rate of month libor plus a range of to 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as follows increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of msrs as the underlying loans prepay faster  which causes accelerated runoff  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by a lower overall cost of servicing 
increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of msrs as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period  and the amounts of servicing advances and related interest expense also increase 
increases in the discount rate reduce the value of msrs due to the lower overall net present value of the net cash flows 
the cash flow and prepayment assumptions used in our discounted cash flow models are based on empirical data drawn from the historical performance of our msrs adjusted to reflect current market conditions  which we believe are consistent with assumptions used by market participants valuing similar msrs 
on a quarterly basis  the valuation of our msrs is reviewed by a third party valuation expert 
valuation of loans held for sale we estimate the value of loans measured at fair value on a recurring basis by utilizing recent observable market trades for loans of similar terms adjusted for credit risk and other individual loan characteristics 
these loans primarily represent mortgage loans originated and held until sold to secondary market investors through whole loan sales 
changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the period in which the change occurs 
we account for all other loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value 
we account for the excess of cost over fair value as a valuation allowance and include changes in the valuation allowance in gain loss on loans held for sale  net  in the period in which the change occurs 
a significant portion of these loans is non performing and current market illiquidity has reduced the availability of observable pricing data 
when we enter into an agreement to sell a loan to an investor at a set price  the loan is valued at the commitment price 
we base the fair value of uncommitted loans on the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk of the estimated cash flows 
the more significant assumptions used in the valuation of performing loans include historical default rates  re performance rates on defaulted loans  loss severity on defaulted loans  average resolution timeline  average coupon and discount rate 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of nonperforming loans include current market value of the underlying collateral based on third party sources such as appraisals or broker price opinions  resolution timeline  estimated foreclosure and disposition costs that are based on historical experience and consider that state in which the property is located and the type of property  and discount rate 
deferred tax assets the use of estimates and the application of judgment are involved in the determination of our overall tax provision and the evaluation of the realizability of our gross deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  we conduct periodic evaluations of positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset can be realized in future periods 
among the factors considered in this evaluation are estimates of future taxable income  future reversals of temporary differences  tax character ordinary versus capital and the impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented if warranted 
we assess the amount of the valuation allowance each quarter 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary at december  goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net carrying value 
effective with our adoption of asu asc  intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of  we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary 
factors that we consider in the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions  conditions of the industry and market in which we operate  regulatory developments  cost factors and our overall financial performance 
if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value  a two step quantitative test is required 
under the two step impairment test  we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net carrying value including goodwill 
we derive the fair value of reporting units based on valuation techniques that we believe market participants would use discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
our qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment testing involves the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment on the part of management 
from time to time  we may obtain assistance from third parties in our quantitative evaluation 
the discounted cash flow valuation methodology uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance  discount rates and economic conditions that may differ from actual future results achieved 
in projecting our cash flows  we use projected growth rates or  where applicable  the projected prepayment rate 
for the discount rate  we use a rate that reflects our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 
at december   the  balance of goodwill is comprised of  recorded in connection with the homeward acquisition   recorded in connection with the litton acquisition and  recorded in connection with the homeq acquisition 
for homeward   of the goodwill portion of the purchase price allocation has been assigned to the servicing segment   has been assigned to the lending segment and the remaining  has been assigned to the diversified fee based business which is included in corporate items and other 
for litton and homeq  the entire balance of goodwill pertains to the servicing segment 
we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august st of each year 
based on our annual assessment  we determined that goodwill was not impaired 
beginning in  our annual impairment test will include the goodwill related to the homeward acquisition 
litigation we monitor our litigation matters  including advice from external legal counsel  and regularly perform assessments of these matters for potential loss accrual and disclosure 
we establish reserves for settlements  judgments on appeal and filed and or threatened claims for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
segment results and financial condition for each of our segments  the following section discusses the changes in financial condition during the year ended december  and the pre tax results of operations for the annual periods ended december   and servicing servicing involves the collection and remittance of principal and interest payments received from borrowers  the administration of mortgage escrow accounts  the collection of insurance claims  the management of loans that are delinquent or in foreclosure or bankruptcy  including making servicing advances  evaluating loans for modification and other loss mitigation activities and  if necessary  foreclosure referrals and reo sales 
we typically earn contractual monthly servicing fees pursuant to servicing agreements which are typically payable as a percentage of upb as well as other ancillary fees on mortgage loans for which we own the msrs 
we also earn fees under both sub servicing and special servicing arrangements with banks and other institutions that own the msrs 
we typically earn these fees either as a percentage of upb or on a per loan basis

also excludes the effects  which were insignificant  of the facilities assumed in connection with the homeward acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the hlss transactions 
during  in addition to the  scheduled quarterly principal repayments on our  sstl  we made mandatory principal prepayments of  from the proceeds of our hlss transactions 
this rate declined from principally because we used a portion of the proceeds from the hlss transactions to repay borrowings from higher cost advance funding facilities before repaying the fixed rate litton facility in december 
in  we had  by june  repaid the remaining  balance outstanding under the  sstl 
the repayments included  of prepayments in addition to the mandatory quarterly repayments of  these prepayments resulted in a write off to interest expense of  of debt discount and  of deferred debt issuance costs 
excluding these additional costs  the effective annual interest rate would have been for this rate declined from  principally because of a decline in facility costs charged on certain facilities and an increase in average borrowings relative to facility costs which resulted in a significant decline in the proportion of interest expense represented by the amortization of facility costs

newly hired ocwen employees in india  uruguay and the us are now principally responsible for the servicing related duties for the loans acquired from litton and homeq 
the following table provides information regarding the changes in our portfolio of residential assets serviced amount of upb count portfolio at beginning of year   additions    runoff     portfolio at end of year   versus residential servicing and subservicing fees for were higher than primarily due to a increase in the average upb of assets serviced principally because of three large msr portfolios we acquired during the second quarter of the billion saxon acquisition included the rights to service approximately billion of loans that we previously had subserviced for saxon 
during  the acquired msr portfolios generated incremental servicing fees of approximately  in addition  servicing fees earned on the litton portfolio were  higher in as included only four months of revenue 
because we acquired the homeward servicing portfolio on december   it did not have a significant impact on these increases were offset in part by runoff of the portfolio as a result of principal repayments  modifications and real estate sales  incentive fees of  earned on subservicing portfolios added during  a increase in the ratio of the upb of serviced loans to subserviced loans in our portfolio to at december  as compared to at december  as a result of the homeward acquisition and the msr acquisitions including the effect of the transfer to the servicing category of approximately billion of upb that we were subservicing for saxon prior to the saxon msr transaction  and a increase in completed modifications as compared to the change in mix of serviced loans versus subserviced loans was one of the factors that resulted in residential servicing and subservicing revenues growing faster than the loan portfolio as these revenues increased to of average upb in as compared to in the increase in modifications contributed to revenue growth because when we return a loan to performing status we generally recognize any deferred servicing fees and late fees on the loan 
for loans modified under hamp  we earn hamp fees in place of late fees 
as noted above  completed modifications were up in with sam accounting for of our modifications in and hamp accounting for as compared to in of the total modifications completed during  included principal modifications 
as a result of modifications we recognized loan servicing fees and late charges of  and  during and  respectively  for completed modifications 
we also earned hamp fees of  and  in and  respectively  which included hamp success fees of  and  in and  respectively  for loans that were still performing at the one year anniversary of their modification 
in january  the federal government announced that it was extending the hamp program through december in addition  the new hamp increases investor incentives for principal reduction modifications  extends the scope of the program to include renter occupied investment properties and makes the program more flexible for borrowers with certain large non mortgage debts such as medical obligations 
another factor contributing to the net increase in revenues was the decrease in the delinquency rates of the loans in our portfolio 
our overall delinquency rates decreased from of total upb at december  to at december  largely because of modifications  especially of the litton portfolio  which have driven down delinquency rates and averted foreclosures on delinquent loans and because of improvements in our early loss mitigation efforts

as of december   we estimate that the balance of deferred servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments was  compared to  at december  the increase is primarily due to the homeward acquisition and the msr acquisitions completed in the second quarter of operating expenses increased by  in  or  as compared to primarily because of the effects of the litton acquisition and the msr acquisitions 
through december   we incurred  of acquisition related expenses associated with the homeward acquisition 
compensation and benefits increased by  or  because o excluding employees of homeward and litton loan servicing  average staffing increased by a combined  or  as we increased our staffing to manage the actual and planned increase in the servicing portfolio  and we insourced certain foreclosure functions that had previously been outsourced 
o however  the effects of this increase in staffing were partly offset by the  of nonrecurring expenses in that were associated with litton loan servicing 
amortization of msrs increased by  in due principally to  of additional amortization attributed to litton and  attributed to the msrs acquired during the second quarter of offset in part by a decline in amortization on pre existing msrs because of runoff of the portfolio 
technology and occupancy and equipment costs increased by a combined  as we have added facilities and infrastructure to support the residential servicing portfolio growth 
servicing and origination expense increased by  primarily as a result of growth in the portfolio and a  charge we recorded to establish a liability for compensatory fees based on performance against benchmarks for various metrics associated with the servicing of non performing loans for gses 
the comparison between and is greatly influenced by substantial transaction related costs for the litton acquisition during the last four months of o  attributable to litton that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits of  and occupancy and equipment costs of  occupancy and equipment costs include the  charge in the first quarter to establish a liability for the remaining lease payments on the former litton facility located in georgia that we vacated in march 
o the  fee included in professional services that we incurred in the first quarter as a result of cancelling the planned  upsizing of our sstl facility because cash generated from operations  the sale of assets to hlss and maximized borrowings under our advance facilities enabled us to close the saxon and jpmcb msr transactions in without upsizing the facility 
o  of operating expenses that included  of compensation and benefits   of technology and communication costs   of professional services and  of occupancy costs 
excluding interest on the financing liabilities that we recognized in connection with the hlss transactions and the debt assumed in the homeward acquisition  interest expense on borrowings for was higher than in this increase was principally the result of the effects of an increase in average borrowings on advance facilities principally as a result of the litton acquisition  saxon msr transaction and jpmcb msr transaction because it occurred so late in the year  the homeward acquisition had little effect interest on the  sstl that we entered into in connection with the litton acquisition offset by o the transfer of the homeq facility to hlss in the first quarter of o the repayment of billion of match funded borrowings with the proceeds from the sales of msrs and match funded advances to hlss in o lower spreads on advance facilities  particularly as a result of the fixed rate on the litton advance facility o prepayments in on the prior sstl that was related to the homeq acquisition resulted in the accelerated amortization of  of deferred facility costs and unamortized discount 
excluding this accelerated amortization  the average rate on borrowings would have been 
excluding the hlss financing facility and the homeward facilities  average borrowings of the servicing segment increased by during as compared to as average advances and match funded advances increased by during the same period 
advances and msrs acquired as part of the litton acquisition  saxon msr transaction and jpmcb msr transaction were partially offset by a decline in average advances arising from the homeq acquisition  especially as a result of the transfer of the homeq advances to hlss in the first quarter of and by the sale of match funded advances to hlss in the second and third quarters of borrowing increased relative to advances because of a somewhat higher percentage of advances funded under the litton advance facility than under other advance facilities and because of increased borrowing relative to available collateral to support the second quarter msr acquisitions 
versus residential servicing and subservicing fees for were higher than because of a increase in the average upb of residential assets serviced principally as a result of the litton and homeq acquisitions and because of a increase in modifications 
servicing fees for include  earned on the litton portfolio for the period from the acquisition date on september  through december  an increase in the percentage of upb representing servicing rather than subservicing to at december   an increase as compared to at december  this increase was a result of the billion of upb that we acquired in the litton acquisition 
as a result of these changes  revenue increased relative to average upb for to as compared to for due primarily due to a higher mix of servicing versus subservicing as a result of the saxon msr transaction  homeq acquisition and litton acquisition 
the effect on revenues of the litton acquisition was tempered by the fact that initial revenues from newly acquired servicing are principally the contractual servicing fee and late fees 
other ancillary revenues  which are driven by the resolution of non performing loans  ramp up gradually in the first year after the acquisition 
the increase in our overall delinquency rates from of total upb at december  to at december  is largely due to much higher delinquencies at boarding for the litton portfolio 
excluding the litton portfolio  the upb of non performing residential assets serviced as a percentage of the total portfolio was at december  prepayment speed was percentage points higher in primarily due to an increase in regular principal amortization and principal reduction modifications 
real estate sales and other involuntary liquidations accounted for approximately of average cpr for with regular principal payments  principal reduction modifications and other voluntary payoffs accounting for the remaining

in addition  we earned total hamp fees of  and  in and  respectively 
these amounts included hamp success fees of  and  in and  respectively on loans that were still performing at the one year anniversary of their modification 
as of december   we estimate that the balance of uncollected and unrecognized servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments was  compared to  as of december  the increase is primarily due to the billion of servicing upb acquired in the litton acquisition 
process management fee revenues are primarily comprised of referral commissions for sales of foreclosed residential real estate through our network of brokers 
process management fees also include fees earned from altisource in connection with the preparation of foreclosure and similar documents on loans that have defaulted 
after  we experienced a substantial decline in document preparation fees as we aligned with new freddie mac and fannie mae guidelines that restrict certain fees 
operating expenses increased by  or  largely because of the effects of the litton acquisition and the effects of the homeq acquisition on and results amortization of msrs increased by  in due to  of amortization attributed to litton and an increase of  related to homeq offset in part by a decline in amortization on pre existing msrs 
expenses incurred in connection with the litton acquisition  excluding amortization of msrs  were  and include o severance  warn act compensation and other benefits of  o professional fees of  o technology and communication costs of  and o occupancy and equipment costs of  the increases in operating expenses attributed to the litton acquisition in were offset by similar expenses incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition in of  which included o severance and warn act compensation of  o occupancy and equipment costs of  and o professional fees of  excluding operating expenses related to the litton and homeq acquisitions  as well as amortization of msrs  operating expenses increased by  from to  as we increased our staffing in india  uruguay and the us to manage the increase in the size of the servicing portfolio 
excluding litton personnel  average staffing in india and uruguay increased by a combined and in the us by 
total operating expenses for were of average upb as compared to for interest expense on borrowings for was higher than in this increase was principally the result of an increase in average borrowings on advance facilities as a result of the homeq and litton acquisitions and the closing of the  sstl related to the litton acquisition on september  as noted above  the repayment of the  sstl related to the homeq acquisition  including  of accelerated prepayments on this loan in resulted in a write off to interest expense of  of related debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs 
excluding this writeoff the average effective rate would have been net settlements of  related to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during the second quarter of as compared to  of such settlements in lower spreads on advance facilities  particularly the litton advance facility partly offset these increases 
average borrowings of the servicing segment increased by during as compared to as average advances and match funded advances increased by during the same period due to our acquisition of advances and msrs as part of the homeq and litton acquisitions

principally as a result of these transactions advances and match funded advances decreased by  primarily due to the following o transferred or sold billion of advances to hlss including the remaining  of homeq related advances and billion of litton related advances outstanding o collected advances on the homeq and litton portfolios acquisitions prior to the sales to hlss as we continued to improve the performance of the acquired loan portfolios o acquired billion of advances in connection with the msr acquisitions  principally the saxon and jpmc msr transactions o acquired billion as part of the homeward acquisition 
msrs  at amortized cost increased by  as we acquired  in the homeward acquisition and acquired  as a result of the second and third quarter msr acquisitions 
this growth was offset by amortization of  msrs  at fair value were acquired from homeward and comprise servicing rights for prime mortgage loans for which we manage the effects of interest rate risk with derivative financial instruments 
we elected to account for this class of servicing assets using the fair value measurement method 
recorded goodwill of  in the homeward acquisition 
match funded liabilities declined by  as borrowing under the litton and homeq facilities declined by  and  respectively  as a result of collections on advances 
in addition  in connection with the hlss transactions  we repaid the class d term note which had a balance of  at december   and hlss assumed the remaining  balance of match funded liabilities associated with the homeq advance facility 
we also used billion of proceeds from the sale of advances and msrs to hlss to repay match funded liabilities  including the payoff and termination of three facilities which had a combined balance of billion outstanding at december  partly offsetting these declines  we entered into four new advance facilities that we used to fund the second quarter msr acquisitions and that added  to the balance outstanding at december  in addition  we added five facilities with an outstanding balance of billion as a result of the homeward acquisition 
lines of credit and other borrowings increased by  in part because the sales of rights to msrs to hlss were accounted for as financings and resulted in the recognition of liabilities equal to the sales proceeds of which  was outstanding at december  in addition  a new financing facility that we added in to finance the acquisition of msrs from bana had an outstanding balance of  at december  we also entered into a senior unsecured loan agreement with altisource under which we borrowed  to finance a portion of the homeward acquisition  and we borrowed an additional  net of an original issue discount of  through an incremental term loan pursuant to our existing sstl facility 
these increases were offset by mandatory prepayments of the sstl of  that were required as a result of the hlss transactions and   of scheduled quarterly repayments 
the following balance sheet items were also affected by the homeward acquisition  the msr acquisitions and the hlss transactions debt service accounts include both cash collections transferred to the issuer but not yet applied to the related debt and cash held in reserve to pay for potential shortfalls in the funds available to pay principal and interest on match funded liabilities 
unapplied cash varies with the timing of collections 
we paid off three advance financing facilities in and hlss assumed a fourth facility 
offsetting the effects of these changes  we assumed five advance financing facilities as a result of the homeward acquisition 
as a result  the balance of debt service accounts has declined by  prepaid lenders fees and debt issuance costs decreased by  principally because of  of amortization  the transfer of  of unamortized costs to hlss in march in connection with the hlss transactions and the write off of  of unamortized costs related to the advance facilities we repaid 
partly offsetting these decreases  we recorded  of additional deferred costs related to the three new advance financing facilities added in the second quarter of and  of additional facility costs related the incremental term loan 
the increase in receivables  net during is primarily due to the acquisition of receivables in the homeward acquisition and a  increase in amounts to be recovered from the custodial accounts of the trustees

the effective rate for reflects a benefit from the release of a reserve of  predominantly related to deductions associated with a servicing advance finance structure and with statute expirations 
the reserve for these items had been recorded in prior years 
our effective tax rate for also includes a non cash benefit of approximately associated with the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources as noted in the overview liquidity section  our liquidity as of december   as measured by unencumbered cash plus unused  collateralized advance financing capacity was  a decrease of  or  from december  available credit was zero at december  because we had increased borrowing to fund the homeward acquisition 
at december   our cash position was  compared to  at december  we have invested cash that is in excess of our immediate operating needs primarily in money market deposit accounts 
investment policy and funding strategy 
our primary sources of funds for near term liquidity are collections of servicing fees and ancillary revenues collections of prior servicer advances in excess of new advances proceeds from match funded liabilities proceeds from lines of credit and other secured borrowings  including warehouse facilities proceeds from sales of rights to msrs and related advances to hlss proceeds from sales of originated loans 
advances and match funded advances comprised of total assets at december  most of our advances have the highest reimbursement priority ie  top of the waterfall so that we are entitled to repayment from respective loan or reo liquidation proceeds before any interest or principal is paid on the bonds 
for the loan origination business acquired in the homeward acquisition  we use mortgage loan warehouse facilities to fund loans on a short term basis until they are sold to secondary market investors  such as the gses or other third party investors 
the majority of these warehouse facilities are structured as repurchase agreements under which ownership of the loans is temporarily transferred to a lender 
the loans are transferred at a discount or haircut which serves as the primary credit enhancement for the lender 
the funds are repaid using the proceeds from the sale of the loans to the secondary market investors  usually within days 
subsequent to december   we extended the maturity date of a number of the warehouse facilities 
see note for additional details 
in addition to these near term sources  potential additional long term sources of liquidity include proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and equity capital  although we cannot assure you that they will be available on terms that we find acceptable 
on november   we completed the public offering of  shares of common stock at a per share price of and received net proceeds of  in  we used the net proceeds to temporarily reduce our borrowings under advance funding facilities rather than invest the proceeds at short term investment rates below our effective cost of borrowing 
in  we used excess cash to fund servicing acquisitions and increased our advance borrowings 
in connection with the rescap acquisition in february  we repaid the borrowings under our existing sstl with a portion of the proceeds of a new billion sstl facility 
we also added billion of match funded debt under three advance funding facilities 
see note for additional information on the rescap acquisition 
we also rely on the secondary mortgage market as a source of long term capital to support our lending operations 
substantially all of the mortgage loans that we produce are sold in the secondary mortgage market in the form of residential mortgage backed securities guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
our primary uses of funds are payments for advances in excess of collections on existing servicing portfolios payment of interest and operating costs purchase of msrs and related advances funding of originated loans repayments of borrowings  including match funded liabilities and warehouse facilities 
we closely monitor our liquidity position and ongoing funding requirements  and we regularly monitor and project cash flow by period to minimize liquidity risk 
in assessing our liquidity outlook  our primary focus is on three measures requirements for maturing liabilities compared to dollars generated from maturing assets and operating cash flow the change in advances and match funded advances compared to the change in match funded liabilities unused borrowing capacity 
at december   billion of our total maximum borrowing capacity remained unused 
we maintain unused borrowing capacity for three reasons as a protection should advances increase due to increased delinquencies as a protection should we be unable to either renew existing facilities or obtain new facilities to provide capacity for the acquisition of additional msrs 
outlook 
in order to reduce fees charged by lenders which we recognize as interest expense  we limit unused borrowing capacity to a level that we consider prudent relative to the current levels of advances and to our funding needs for reasonably foreseeable changes in advances 
we also monitor the duration of our funding sources 
increases in the term of our funding sources allows us to better match the duration of our advances and corresponding borrowings and to further reduce the relative cost of up front facility fees and expenses 
we believe that we have sufficient capacity to fund all but the largest servicing acquisitions without issuing equity capital 
cash from operations  the hlss transactions and advance financing facilities provided sufficient funds to close the saxon and jpmcb msr transactions on april  for the homeward acquisition  we issued  of the preferred shares and funded the  cash consideration primarily through a  incremental term loan from barclays bank plc pursuant to our existing sstl facility  through a  loan from altisource pursuant to a new senior unsecured loan agreement  through net proceeds from the december  sale of rights to msrs and related servicing advances to hlss  and through cash generated from our operations 
additional senior secured debt and borrowings under servicing advance facilities was sufficient to fund the rescap acquisition without the need to raise new equity at ocwen 
debt financing summary 
the more significant changes in our debt financing during were repaid  on the  existing ocwen sstl including required prepayments of  from the proceeds received on the hlss transactions and  of scheduled quarterly payments  in connection with the homeward acquisition  borrowed  under an incremental term loan pursuant to the existing ocwen sstl facility and borrowed  pursuant to a new senior unsecured loan agreement with altisource  repaid the  sstl and  senior secured revolving line of credit that we assumed in the homeward acquisition  transferred to hlss the  balance of the other match funded term notes issued in connection with the homeq acquisition  repaid the note that we issued in connection with the financing of the advances acquired as part of the litton acquisition 
the balance outstanding under this facility at december  was billion  fully repaid the advance receivables backed note under one match funded advance financing facility and the  term note and the variable funding note under a second facility from the proceeds of the hlss flow sales and terminated the facilities 
borrowing under the note had increased to  at june  as part of the financing of the jpmcb msr transaction  issued notes with a combined maximum borrowing capacity of billion under two new facilities in connection with the financing of advances that we acquired as part of the saxon msr transaction 
the total balance outstanding under these facilities at december  was  in connection with the acquisition of msrs from bana in june  issued notes with a maximum borrowing capacity of  under a new advance funding facility and issued a new promissory note to finance the msrs 
at december   a total of  was outstanding under these new agreements 
in connection with the homeward acquisition  we assumed advance financing facilities with a maximum borrowing capacity of billion and billion of outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december  also  in connection with the homeward acquisition  we assumed mortgage loan warehouse facilities with a maximum borrowing capacity of  and  of borrowings outstanding at december  maximum borrowing capacity for match funded advances decreased by billion from billion at december  during  we fully repaid and terminated match funded advance financing facilities that had total aggregate borrowing capacity of billion at december  this decrease is also partly a result of the assumption by hlss of one of our advance financing facilities in connection with the hlss transactions see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the hlss transactions the facility assumed by hlss had a maximum borrowing capacity of  at december  these declines were offset in part by billion of borrowing capacity added in connection with the saxon msr transaction  billion added in connection with the homeward acquisition   added in connection with the bana msr acquisition and  added in connection with the aurora small balance commercial msr acquisition 
our unused advance borrowing capacity decreased from billion at december  to billion at december  we fully repaid and terminated match funded facilities that had unused borrowing capacity of billion at december  the decrease is also due in part to the loss of  of unused borrowing capacity that was available at december  under the facility that was assumed by hlss 
these declines were partially offset by four new facilities that we added during in connection with the saxon  bana and aurora msr acquisitions 
these facilities had unused borrowing capacity of  at december  unused borrowing capacity at december  includes  related to the homeward advance facilities 
our ability to finance servicing advances is a significant factor that affects our liquidity 
our ability to continue to pledge collateral under each advance facility depends on the performance of the collateral 
in addition  a number of our match funded advance facilities contain provisions that limit the eligibility of advances to be financed based on the length of time that advances are outstanding  and certain of our match funded advance facilities have provisions that limit new borrowings if average foreclosure timelines extend beyond a certain time period  either of which  if such provisions applied  could adversely affect liquidity by reducing our average effective advance rate 
currently  the large majority of our collateral qualifies for financing under the advance facility to which it is pledged 
ongoing inquiries into servicer foreclosure processes could result in actions by state or federal governmental bodies  regulators or the courts that could result in a further extension of foreclosure timelines 
while the effect of such extensions could be an increase in advances  the effect on liquidity will be lessened if ocwen maintains its ability to utilize spare capacity on its advance facilities because approximately of the increase in advances could be borrowed 
furthermore  if foreclosure moratoria are issued in a manner that brings into question the timely recovery of advances on foreclosed properties  ocwen may no longer be obligated to make further advances and may be able to recover existing advances in certain securitizations from pool level collections which could mitigate any advance increase 
the effects of the extension of foreclosure timelines have  thus far  been more than offset by the effects of lower upb delinquencies through loss mitigation efforts and increases in modifications and other forms of resolution  and advances have continued to decline 
absent significant changes in the foreclosure process  we expect advances to continue to decline 
some of our existing debt covenants limit our ability to incur additional debt in relation to our equity  require that we do not exceed maximum levels of delinquent loans and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquid assets and earnings 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in restrictions on new borrowings or the early termination of our borrowing facilities 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with these covenants and do not expect them to restrict our activities 
cash flows for the year ended december  our operating activities provided billion of cash largely due to collections of servicing advances primarily on the litton portfolio and net income adjusted for msr amortization and other non cash items 
excluding cash paid to acquire advances in connection with the homeward acquisition  and excluding the proceeds from the sale of match funded advances to hlss in connection with the hlss transactions  both of which are reported as investing activities  net collections of servicing advances were billion 
operating cash flows were used principally to repay related match funded liabilities and to fund the portions of the homeward acquisition and the msr acquisitions not funded through borrowings

excluding billion paid to acquire advances in connection with the litton acquisition  collections of servicing advances were  the cash provided by advance collections and earnings were partly offset by the payment of settled litigation and the funding of a new debt service account related to the advance facility established to finance the advances acquired as part of the litton acquisition 
the funding of the new interest earning debt service account was offset in part by lower balance requirements for debt service accounts related to the homeq and other match funded facilities as a result of repayments of the borrowings

we also received proceeds of  from the issuance of the  sstl 
we used the proceeds from these two new facilities to fund the litton acquisition 
cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds of  from the issuance of  shares of common stock allowed us to make net repayments of billion against match funded liabilities 
in addition  we were able to repay the  remaining balance of the  sstl and payments of  on the new  sstl 
we also repaid the remaining balance on our fee reimbursement advance 
in connection with the issuance of the new sstl  we paid  of debt issuance costs to the lender

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information regarding amounts we owe to others under contractual obligations as of december  less than one year after one year through three years after three years through five years after five years total lines of credit and other borrowings   contractual interest payments    operating leases     amounts are exclusive of any related discount 
represents estimated future interest payments on borrowings  based on applicable interest rates as of december  we exclude match funded liabilities from the contractual obligations table above because it represents non recourse debt that has been collateralized by match funded advances which are not available to satisfy general claims against ocwen 
holders of the notes issued by the spes have no recourse against any assets other than the match funded advances that serve as collateral for the securitized debt 
actual interest on match funded liabilities was  in future interest may vary depending on utilization  changes in libor and spreads and the execution of hedging strategies 
we also exclude from the contractual obligations table the financing liability of  that we recorded in connection with the sales of rights to msrs to hlss 
because ocwen has not yet transferred legal title to the msrs  the sales were accounted for as a financing 
this financing liability has no contractual maturity and is amortized over the life of the pledged msrs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we engage in transactions with a variety of financial institutions and other companies that are not reflected on our balance sheet 
we are subject to potential financial loss if the counterparties to our off balance sheet transactions are unable to complete an agreed upon transaction 
we seek to limit counterparty risk through financial analysis  dollar limits and other monitoring procedures 
we have also entered into non cancelable operating leases principally for our office facilities 
derivatives 
we record all derivative transactions at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
we use these derivatives primarily to manage our interest rate risk as well as our exposure to changes in the value of the india rupee 
the notional amounts of our derivative contracts do not reflect our exposure to credit loss 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivatives 
involvement with spes 
we use spes for a variety of purposes but principally in the financing of our servicing advances and in the securitization of mortgage loans 
our securitizations of mortgage loans in prior years were structured as sales 
we retained both subordinated and residual interests in six of these spes 
we also subsequently acquired residual and or subordinated interests in five trusts where we were not the transferor but were the servicer 
we determined that four of these securitization trusts are vies of which we were the primary beneficiary 
we included these four trusts in our consolidated financial statements effective january  in december  we sold the residual and subordinated interests that we held in the four consolidated securitization trusts which we then deconsolidated 
we also sold the securities that we held in two of the unconsolidated trusts 
we generally use match funded securitization facilities to finance our servicing advances 
the spes to which the advances are transferred in the securitization transaction are included in our consolidated financial statements either because we have the majority equity interest in the spe or because we are the primary beneficiary where the spe is a vie 
the holders of the debt of these spes can look only to the assets of the spes for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against ocn 
ols had previously guaranteed the payment of the obligations of the issuer under one of our match funded facilities up to a maximum of of the notes outstanding at the end of the facility s revolving period on july  in september  the notes outstanding under this facility were repaid and the facility was terminated 
vies 
in addition to certain of our financing spes  we have invested in several other vies primarily in connection with purchases of whole loans 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we include the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification liability 
as a result of the homeward acquisition  we have exposure to potential mortgage loan repurchase and indemnifications in our capacity as a loan originator and servicer 
the estimation of the liability for probable losses related to repurchase and indemnification obligations as loan originator and servicer considers an estimate of probable future repurchase or indemnification obligations based on industry data of loans of similar type segregated by year of origination 
an estimated loss severity  based on current loss rates for similar loans  is then applied to probable repurchases and indemnifications to estimate the liability for loan repurchases and indemnifications 
in addition  we assumed the warranties and obligations for the loans underlying one of our msr acquisitions where we assumed the origination representation and warranties 
see risk factors risks related to our business and industry we may be required to indemnify or repurchase certain loans if they fail to meet criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances 
the liability for loan repurchases and indemnifications is calculated using a model to estimate future loan repurchase requests with historical loss rates applied to determine incurred losses 
our historical loss rates consider our historical loss experience we incur upon sale or liquidation of a repurchased loan as well as current market conditions 
the underlying trends for loan repurchases and indemnifications are volatile  and there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding our expectations of future loan repurchases and indemnifications and related loss severities 
due to the significant uncertainties surrounding these estimates related to future repurchase and indemnification requests by investors and insurers as well as uncertainties surrounding home prices  it is possible that our exposure could exceed our recorded mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification liability 
our estimate of the mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification liability considers the current macro economic environment and recent repurchase trends  however  if we experience a prolonged period of higher repurchase and indemnification activity or if weakness in the housing market continues and further declines in home values occur  then our realized losses from loan repurchases and indemnifications may ultimately be in excess of our recorded liability 
given the levels of realized losses in recent periods  there is a reasonable possibility that future losses may be in excess of our recorded liability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands our principal exposures to market risk include interest rate risk  liquidity risk  consumer credit risk  counterparty credit risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
market risk also reflects the risk of declines in the valuation of financial instruments and the collateral underlying loans 
our investment committee reviews significant transactions that may affect market risk and is authorized to utilize a wide variety of techniques and strategies to manage market risk 
interest rate risk our principal market exposure is to interest rate risk due to the impact on our mortgage related assets and commitments  including mortgage loans held for sale  interest rate lock commitments irlcs and msrs 
changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our volume of mortgage loan originations or reduce the value of our msrs 
loans held for sale and irlcs irlcs represent an agreement to purchase loans from a third party originator or an agreement to extend credit to a mortgage loan applicant  whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding 
our mortgage loans held for sale  which we hold in inventory while awaiting sale into the secondary market  and our irlcs are subject to the effects of changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the commitment through the sale of the loan into the secondary market 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of the lock commitment through i the lock commitment cancellation or expiration date or ii through the date of sale into the secondary mortgage market 
loan commitments generally range from to days  and our holding period of the mortgage loan from funding to sale is typically less than days 
for our loans held for sale that we have elected to carry at fair value  we manage the associated interest rate risk through an active hedging program overseen by our investment committee 
our hedging policy determines the hedging instruments to be used in the mortgage loan hedging program  which include forward sales of agency to be announced securities tbas  whole loan forward sales  eurodollar futures and interest rate options 
forward mortgage backed securities mbs trades are primarily used to fix the forward sales price that will be realized upon the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary market 
our hedging policy also stipulates the hedge ratio we must maintain in managing this interest rate risk  which is also monitored by our investment committee 
fair value msrs our msrs that we have elected to carry at fair value are subject to substantial interest rate risk as the mortgage notes underlying the msrs permit the borrowers to prepay the loans 
consequently  the value of these msrs generally tends to diminish in periods of declining interest rates as prepayments increase and tends to increase in periods of rising interest rates as prepayments decrease 
although the level of interest rates is a key driver of prepayment activity  there are other factors that influence prepayments  including home prices  underwriting standards and product characteristics 
for these msrs  we enter into economic hedges  including interest rate swaps  us treasury futures and forward mbs trades to minimize the effects of loss in value associated with increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates 
our investment committee establishes and maintains policies that govern our hedging program  including such factors as our target hedge ratio  the hedge instruments that we are permitted to use in our hedging activities and the counterparties with whom we are permitted to enter into hedging transactions 
our hedging policy currently permits us to use mortgage tba instruments and options on mortgage tbas  treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury and eurodollar futures as well as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and interest rate forwards  floors and swaptions as hedge instruments in our msr hedging program 
sensitivity analysis fair value msrs  loans held for sale and related derivatives the following table summarizes the estimated change in the fair value of our fair value msrs  loans held for sale and related derivatives as of december  given hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve in thousands change in fair value down bps up bps loans held for sale   forward mbs trades   total loans held for sale and related derivatives fair value msrs   msrs  embedded in pipeline   total msrs   derivatives related to msrs   total msrs and related derivatives  total  net  we used december  market rates on our instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and presented for illustrative purposes only 
changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in fair value may not be linear 
borrowings the debt used to finance much of our operations is exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
we purchase interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to minimize future interest rate exposure from increases in one month libor interest rates 
based on december  balances  if interest rates were to increase by on our variable rate debt excluding our sstl and interest earning cash and float balances  we estimate a net positive impact of approximately  resulting from an increase of  in annual interest income and a decrease of  in annual interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense reflects a reduction of approximately  due to the anticipated effects of our hedging activities 
see the tables below and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our use of derivatives 
interest rate sensitive financial instruments the tables below present the notional amounts of our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates categorized by expected maturity and the related fair value of these instruments at december  and we use certain assumptions to estimate the expected maturity and fair value of these instruments 
we base expected maturities upon contractual maturity and projected repayments and prepayments of principal based on our historical experience 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from our historical experience

net of market valuation allowances and including non performing loans

this financing liability has no contractual maturity and is amortized over the life of the pledged msrs 
average month libor for the periods indicated 
liquidity risk we are exposed to liquidity risk primarily because the cash required to support the servicing business includes the requirement to make advances pursuant to servicing contracts and the need to retain msrs 
we are also exposed to liquidity risk by our need to originate and finance mortgage loans and sell mortgage loans into secondary markets 
we estimate how our liquidity needs may be impacted by a number of factors  including fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to our business strategy  changes in our business operations  levels of interest rates and unanticipated events 
we also assess market conditions and capacity for debt issuance in the various markets we access to fund our business needs 
additionally  we have established internal processes to anticipate future cash needs and continuously monitor the availability of funds pursuant to our existing debt arrangements 
we address liquidity risk by maintaining committed borrowing capacity in excess of our expected needs and by extending the tenor of our funding arrangements 
in general  we finance our operations through operating cash flow  match funding agreements and secured borrowings 
see overview liquidity summary and liquidity and capital resources for additional discussions of liquidity 
consumer credit risk we sell our loans on a non recourse basis 
however  we also provide representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of the loans sold that typically are in place for the life of the loan 
in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties  we may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or indemnify the purchaser  and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan may be borne by us 
if there is no breach of a representation and warranty provision  we have no obligation to repurchase the loan or indemnify the investor against loss 
the outstanding upb of loans sold by us represents the maximum potential exposure related to representation and warranty provisions 
we maintain a reserve for losses on loans repurchased or indemnified as a result of breaches of representations and warranties on our sold loans 
we base our estimate on our most recent data regarding loan repurchases and indemnity payments  actual credit losses on repurchased loans and recovery history  among other factors 
internal factors that affect our estimate include  among other things  level of loan sales  to whom the loans are sold  the expectation of credit loss on repurchases and indemnifications  our success rate at appealing repurchase demands and our ability to recover any losses from third parties 
external factors that may affect our estimate include  among other things  the overall economic condition in the housing market  the economic condition of borrowers  the political environment at gses and the overall us and world economy 
many of the factors are beyond our control and may lead to judgments that are susceptible to change 
we are also responsible for the origination representation and warranties obligations for the loans underlying one of the msr portfolios acquired in the homeward acquisition 
we may be required to indemnify or repurchase certain loans if they fail to meet criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances 
we determine the required reserve using a model to estimate future loan referrals with historical loss rates applied to determine incurred losses 
our historical loss rates consider our historical loss experience we incur upon sale or liquidation of a repurchased loan as well as current market conditions 
we are not subject to the majority of the credit related risk inherent in maintaining a mortgage loan portfolio because we do not hold loans for investment purposes 
nearly all mortgage loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within days of origination 
counterparty credit risk concentration risk credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value 
we manage credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions through national exchanges  primary dealers or approved counterparties and the use of mutual margining agreements whenever possible to limit potential exposure 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to various agreements 
we manage such risk by monitoring the credit ratings of our counterparties and do not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
counterparty credit risk exists with our third party originators from whom we purchase originated mortgage loans 
the third party originators incur a representation and warranty obligation when we acquire the mortgage loan from them  and they agree to reimburse us for any losses incurred due to an origination defect 
we become exposed to losses for origination defects if the third party originator is not able to reimburse us for losses incurred for indemnification or repurchase 
we mitigate this risk by monitoring purchase limits from our third party originators to reduce any concentration exposure  quality control reviews of the third party originators  underwriting standards and monitoring the credit worthiness of third party originators on a periodic basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our investment in non us dollar functional currency operations to the extent that our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged 
our operations in india and uruguay expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk  but we do not consider this risk significant 
during  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of changes in the value of the india rupee on recurring amounts payable to our india subsidiary  ofspl  for services rendered to us affiliates 
we did not designate these contracts as hedges 
these contracts expired in april  and we entered into new contracts in august we did not designate the new contracts as hedges  and the notional balance of these contracts was  at december  in january  we terminated these contracts prior to their scheduled maturity after determining that the cost of maintaining the contracts exceeded our probable exposure to exchange rate risk
