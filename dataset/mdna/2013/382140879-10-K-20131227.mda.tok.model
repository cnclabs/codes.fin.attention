in addition we introduced a limited breakfast menu in november and total net revenues for breakfast were approximately  for fiscal our outlook for fiscal is cautiously optimistic based on the last three years of positive sales trends  however our sales trends are influenced by many factors and the macroeconomic environment remains challenging for smaller restaurant chains 
our average transaction decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal with the addition of breakfast  while our total customer traffic increased in excess of 
we are continuing to manage our marketing communications to balance growth in customer traffic and the average customer expenditure

we anticipate cost pressure on several core commodities  including beef  bacon and dairy for fiscal however  we anticipate our food and packaging costs as a percentage of sales will decrease slightly in fiscal from a combination of price increases  product sales mix changes and recipe modifications 
payroll and other employee benefit costs for fiscal  payroll and other employee benefit costs increased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales 
the increase in payroll and other employee benefit expenses is primarily due to the increase in restaurant sales 
additionally with the implementation of breakfast in november our payroll and employee benefit costs were abnormally high during the first six months of fiscal due to training and over staffing to handle the additional sales 
because payroll costs are semi variable in nature they normally decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales when there is an increase in restaurant sales  however the lower average customer expenditure at breakfast somewhat mitigates this decrease 
payroll and other employee benefits increased approximately  in fiscal due to three restaurants purchased from franchisees in fiscal and and decreased approximately  in fiscal due to two company owned restaurants sold in we anticipate payroll and other employee benefit costs will decrease as a percentage of sales in fiscal due to the operating leverage on increasing sales 
occupancy and other operating costs for fiscal  occupancy and other operating costs increased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales 
the  increase in occupancy and other costs is primarily attributable to a decrease of  in occupancy and other restaurant operating costs due to the two restaurants sold in fiscal the decrease above was offset by the following increases increase of  in occupancy and other restaurant operating costs due to the three restaurants purchased from franchisees in fiscal and increases in various other restaurant operating costs of  at existing restaurants comprised primarily of repairs and maintenance  property taxes  utility costs and bank fees

general and administrative costs for fiscal  general and administrative costs increased  from  of total revenues in fiscal to  of total revenues 
the  increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily attributable to increase in payroll and employee benefit costs of  due to the reinstatement of certain management level salaries that were reduced in fiscal and  as well as an increase in health insurance costs 
increase in professional services and financial relations costs of increase in incentive stock option compensation expense of  net increases in various other expenses of  advertising costs for fiscal  advertising costs increased  from  of restaurant sales in fiscal to  of restaurant sales

net loss attributable to common shareholders for fiscal the net loss attributable to common shareholders includes dividends of  related to the series c convertible preferred stock transaction completed with sii on september  liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital as of september   we had a working capital excess of  because restaurant sales are collected in cash and accounts payable for food and paper products are paid two to four weeks later  restaurant companies often operate with working capital deficits 
we anticipate that working capital deficits may be incurred in the future and possibly increase if and when new good times restaurants are opened 
we believe that we will have sufficient capital to meet our working capital  long term debt obligations and recurring capital expenditure needs in fiscal and beyond

we have never experienced any losses related to these contingent lease liabilities  however  if a franchisee defaults on the payments under the leases  we would be liable for the lease payments as the assignor or sub lessor of the lease 
currently we have not been notified nor are we aware of any leases in default under which we are contingently liable 
however there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board  commonly referred to as the fasb 
the fasb sets generally accepted accounting principles gaap that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
over the years  the fasb and other designated gaap setting bodies  have issued standards in the form of fasb statements  interpretations  fasb staff positions  eitf consensuses  aicpa statements of position  etc 
the fasb recognized the complexity of its standard setting process and embarked on a revised process in that culminated in the release on july   of the fasb accounting standards codification  sometimes referred to as the codification or asc 
to the company  this means instead of following the statements  interpretations  staff positions  etc  we will follow the guidance in topics as defined in the asc 
the codification does not change how the company accounts for its transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
however  when referring to guidance issued by the fasb  the company refers to topics in the asc rather than statements  etc 
the above change was made effective by the fasb for periods ending on or after september  we have updated references to gaap in this annual report on form k to reflect the guidance in the codification 
notes receivable we evaluate the collectability of our note receivables from franchisees annually 
the aggregate notes receivable on the consolidated balance sheet at september  were  discontinued operations the company analyzes its operations on a regional basis  when evaluating closed restaurant operations for consideration as to the classification between continuing operations and discontinued operations 
prior to the company evaluated operations at the restaurant level 
in its reevaluation the company determined that as most of the company s restaurants are within the denver metropolitan region and share common advertising  distribution  supervision  and to a certain extent even customers  the company believes it appropriate to perform its analysis on a regional basis 
during fiscal the company closed two restaurants  and in fiscal  the company closed an additional two restaurants 
the operations related to these restaurants are reflected as part of continuing operations as they were within one continuing operating region 
non controlling interests non controlling interests  previously called minority interests  are presented as a separate item in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
consolidated net income or loss attributable to non controlling interests are presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions  and that deconsolidation of a subsidiary is recorded as a gain or loss based on the fair value on the deconsolidation date 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  including land  property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the capitalized costs of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and the expected cash flows are based on recent historical cash flows at the restaurant level the lowest level that cash flows can be determined 
an analysis was performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis at september  assumptions used in preparing expected cash flows were as follows sales projections are as follows fiscal sales are projected to increase with respect to fiscal and for fiscal years to we have used annual increases of to 
the increase in fiscal is due to current trends 
we believe the to increase in the fiscal years beyond is a reasonable expectation of growth and that it would be unreasonable to expect no growth in our sales 
these increases include menu price increases in addition to any real growth 
historically our weighted menu prices have increased to our variable and semi variable restaurant operating costs are projected to increase proportionately with the sales increases as well as increasing an additional per year consistent with inflation 
our other fixed restaurant operating costs are projected to increase to per year 
food and packaging costs are projected to decrease approximately 
as a percentage of sales in relation to our fiscal food and packaging costs as a result of menu price increases and other menu initiatives 
salvage value has been estimated on a restaurant by restaurant basis considering each restaurant s particular equipment package and building size 
given the results of our impairment analysis at september  there are no restaurants which are impaired as their projected undiscounted cash flows show recoverability of their asset values 
our impairment analysis included a sensitivity analysis with regard to the cash flow projections that determine the recoverability of each restaurant s assets 
the results indicate that even with a decline in our projected cash flows we would still not have any potential impairment issues 
however if we elect to sublease  close or otherwise exit a restaurant location impairment could be required 
each time we conduct an impairment analysis in the future we will compare actual results to our projections and assumptions  and to the extent our actual results do not meet expectations  we will revise our assumptions and this could result in impairment charges being recognized 
all of the judgments and assumptions made in preparing the cash flow projections are consistent with our other financial statement calculations and disclosures 
the assumptions used in the cash flow projections are consistent with other forward looking information prepared by the company  such as those used for internal budgets  discussions with third parties  and or reporting to management or the board of directors 
projecting the cash flows for the impairment analysis involves significant estimates with regard to the performance of each restaurant  and it is reasonably possible that the estimates of cash flows may change in the near term resulting in the need to write down operating assets to fair value 
if the assets are determined to be impaired  the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value would be determined using forecasted cash flows discounted using an estimated average cost of capital and the impairment charge would be recognized in income from operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company provides a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
the deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are adjusted as necessary 
we believe it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions 
the company continues to remain subject to examination by us federal authorities for the years through the company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the company financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded 
the company practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
the company has accrued for interest and penalties as of september  variable interest entities once an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity vie  the party with the controlling financial interest  the primary beneficiary  is required to consolidate it 
we have one franchisee with a note payable to the company and after analysis we have determined that  while this franchisee is a vie  we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity  and therefore it is not required to be consolidated 
fair value of financial instruments fair value is established under a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and enhances disclosure about fair value measurements 
new accounting pronouncements there are no new accounting pronouncements that affect the company
