business overview company background and strategy we are a global enterprise that provides our customers with innovative solutions and industry leading products in a variety of markets  including portable communications  communications infrastructure  consumer electronics  mass transit  automotive  defense and clean technology 
we generate revenues and cash flows through the development  manufacture  and distribution of specialty material based products that are sold to multiple customers  primarily original equipment manufacturers oems and contract manufacturers that  in turn  produce component products that are sold to end customers for use in various applications 
as such  our business is highly dependent  although indirectly  on market demand for these end user products 
our ability to forecast future sales growth is largely dependent on management ability to anticipate changing market conditions and how our customers will react to these changing conditions 
it is also highly limited due to the short lead times demanded by our customers and the dynamics of serving as a relatively small supplier in the overall supply chain for these end user products 
in addition  our sales represent a number of different products across a wide range of price points and distribution channels that do not always allow for meaningful quantitative analysis of changes in demand or price per unit with respect to the effect on sales and earnings 
strategically  our current focus is on three mega trends that we believe will fuel the future growth of our company continued growth of the internet and the variety of ways in which it can be accessed  expansion of mass transit  and further investment in clean technology 
these trends and their related markets all require materials that perform to the highest standards  which has been a key strength of our products over the years 
we are also focused on growing our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions or technology investments that will add to or expand our product portfolio  as well as strengthen our presence in existing markets or expand into new markets 
we will continue to focus on business opportunities and invest in expansion around the globe 
our vision is to be the leading innovative  growth oriented  and high technology materials solutions provider for our selective markets 
to achieve this vision  we must have an organization that can cost effectively develop  produce and market products and services that provide clear advantages for our customers and markets 
executive summary was a year of transition for rogers corporation 
under the direction of our management team  led by our new president and ceo  bruce hoechner  we implemented several measures to streamline our organization and rationalize our cost structure in order to better position the company for profitable growth in the future 
the goal of these actions is to become a more streamlined company  both from an organizational and cost perspective  that is focused on customer needs  with efficient manufacturing capabilities and an empowered workforce 
the initiatives we implemented occurred over the course of and touched all areas of the company 
these initiatives included the following i implementation of an early retirement program for certain eligible employees  ii realignment of our organizational structure by consolidating a number of senior executive positions  reorganizing certain business functions and redeploying resources across the company  iii shutting down the power distribution systems start up operation in north america  iv liquidating the outstanding auction rate security investments  v beginning to close down and relocate certain production at the high performance foams manufacturing facility in bremen  germany to be completed in the first quarter of  vi shutting down the operations of the non woven composite materials product lines in rogers  connecticut  and vii initiating a plan to relocate the final inspection operations of the curamik electronics solutions operating segment from its facility in eschenbach  germany to a lower cost region in hungary 
we also introduced internal programs for our employees to help build a culture of accountability that we believe will drive us to higher levels of employee and customer satisfaction 
as a result of these streamlining and rationalization initiatives  we have incurred approximately million of net pre tax charges in we initially anticipated that these actions would result in annualized cost savings of approximately million by the end of however  actual savings began to exceed those projections in the third quarter of  and we now estimate that annualized savings as a result of these initiatives will approach million 
some of these savings will be used to reinvest in certain areas of the company  such as research and development  and in adding resources in strategic areas of the company  such as sales and marketing  in order to drive future growth 
however  we believe that our overall cost structure will remain lower than it was prior to the implementation of these initiatives 
going forward  we will continue to pursue other initiatives aimed at further streamlining our business and reducing our overall cost structure  enabling us to continue to profitably grow the company 
from an operations perspective  net sales were million in  a decline of from million in these results are primarily attributable to the decline in sales in the power electronics solutions operating segments  as the curamik electronics solutions ces operating segment achieved sales of million in  a decline of from million of net sales in  and the power distribution systems pds operating segment had net sales in of million  an decline from million in these declines are primarily attributable to the slowdown of capital infrastructure spending in mass transit  wind energy  and industrial motor drive markets  primarily in europe and china 
we anticipate that these markets will remain at these levels in the near term  but the long term outlook remains positive 
net sales in the high performance foams hpf operating segment increased by to million in from million in  while net sales in the printed circuit materials pcm operating segment declined by from million in to million in we believe that the long term outlook for these segments remains strong as spending in wireless infrastructure and other key markets is projected to increase in the future 
over the course of  we experienced a steady increase in sales volumes over the first nine months of the year  and achieved improved profitability performance over that time as our streamlining initiatives lowered our overall cost structure  enabling greater profitability per sales dollar 
these results were tempered by a decline in sales in the fourth quarter  as we experienced a considerable drop off in orders across all of our businesses at the end of the year 
we believe that this decrease in demand was likely related to the broader economic environment  including concerns over the us fiscal cliff issues 
the market indices appear to be more positive as we enter  and we believe we will see improved growth as the year unfolds 
the outlook for remains strong  particularly with the build out of g lte in the telecom space and as the china stimulus package benefits the mass transit and energy markets 
going forward  we will continue to pursue initiatives aimed at further controlling our cost structure in order to maintain our improved operating leverage 
we will also continue to focus on profitable growth as we focus on expanding our application base for current products  while pursuing new opportunities externally 
we believe that the actions taken in  as well as our internal initiatives and focus  will enable us to achieve our strategic goals to grow the company  while increasing value to our shareholders 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales gross margins selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating income loss equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures other income expense  net realized gain loss interest income expense  net gain on acquisition or disposal income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations vs 
net sales net sales in were million  a decrease from million of sales in the decline in sales in is primarily related to the performance of the curamik electronics solutions operating segment  which experienced a decrease in sales from million in to million in  as well as an decline in sales in the power distribution systems operating segment from million in to million in sales in the printed circuit materials operating segment also declined slightly  from million in to million in these declines were partially offset by a slight increase in sales in the high performance foams operating segment from million in to million in see segment sales and operations below for further discussion on segment performance 
gross margin gross margin decreased by approximately basis points from in to in the primary drivers of the decrease in margins was the decline in sales volumes from to  which contributed approximately basis points to the decline  as well as a decline in overall inventory levels from to resulting in unfavorable absorption during the period 
this decrease is primarily attributable to our focus on working capital management and lowering inventory levels to better match current demand 
this decline was partially offset by improved operating leverage on sales as a result of the streamlining activities that occurred throughout these activities favorably impacted margins by approximately basis points in we expect that margins will continue to improve as the impacts of the streamlining initiatives are realized  particularly when and if sales volumes increase 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative s a expenses were million in  a decrease of from million in s a expenses included approximately million of special charges comprised primarily of a million charge taken as a result of increasing the forecast period on asbestos related liabilities from to years during the fourth quarter of  as well as a charge of million related to the settlement of a pension obligation with the former chief executive officer of the company 
results included approximately million of special charges primarily associated with the acceleration of compensation expense related to the change of chief executive officers during the year 
the overall decline in spending  excluding these charges  of million can be attributed primarily to a reduction of million of incentive and equity compensation costs due to the lower level of performance of the business in as compared to this decline was partially offset by a million increase in costs related to the defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans in as compared to as the projected long term liability on the benefit plans increased as a result of unfavorable market conditions 
excluding these charges  s a as a percentage of sales increased slightly from in to in  mainly due to the decline in sales volumes experienced during  partially offset by cost savings from our streamlining initiatives  which did not fully impact results until the second half of research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million in  a decrease of  from million in as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in and in historically  we have targeted a r d investment as a percentage of net sales  however  in the past few years these percentages have been in the range 
going forward  we intend to increase the investment in r d initiatives  and believe that we will migrate closer to the target over the course of time 
r d will continue to be an important driver to growth for the company 
we intend to reinvest in this area to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for existing materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies that we believe will complement or extend our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges were million in as compared to million in in  these charges were comprised primarily of the following i million in severance related charges resulting from the streamlining initiatives that took place throughout the year  including the early retirement program implemented in the first quarter of  ii approximately million related to the shut down of the bremen manufacturing facility in germany and relocation of certain production to the manufacturing facility in carol stream  illinois  and iii million in severance related charges resulting from actions taken to move of the final inspection operations of curamik from germany to hungary 
the charge relates to the write down to fair value of a dormant facility located in richmond  virginia that was acquired in as part of the mti acquisition 
this facility was sold in the second quarter of equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures was million in  a decrease of from million in the decline is driven primarily by the softening in certain domestic and export markets in japan  particularly in lcd televisions  domestic mobile phones and general industrial applications 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was an expense of million in as compared to income of million in results included a gain of million on the sale of a building in china 
excluding this gain  results were relatively consistent year over year 
realized gain loss realized gain loss represents the portion of the auction rate security impairment that relates to credit losses and is required to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income loss 
the amount of loss recognized in was million as compared to a loss of million in the increase in the loss in is due to the liquidation of the auction rate securities portfolio in the first quarter of  which resulted in the company receiving net cash proceeds of approximately million 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net was expense of million in as compared to expense of million in this expense relates to the interest expense on our long term debt  as well as the interest expense on the long term obligation related to the leased facility in eschenbach  germany that contains most of the ces manufacturing operations 
the overall decline in the expense is driven by a decline in the long term debt during  as we paid down the facilities by million from million at december  to million at december  income tax expense benefit our effective tax rate was in and in in both and  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with certain discrete rate items recorded during the year and also benefited from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity 
in  the rate was primarily impacted by the following items i benefit related to the reversal of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets  and ii benefit related to foreign source income which is taxed at lower rates than income generated in the us 
in  the rate was primarily impacted by the following items i benefit related to the international tax rate differential  ii benefit related to changes in the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets  iii benefit related to foreign source income that is tax at lower rates than income generated in the us  and iv benefit from other general business credits 
in  we established a valuation allowance against substantially all of our us deferred tax assets as we concluded that we did not have sufficient evidence to support the position that these assets would be utilized in the future 
this conclusion was reached primarily due to the presence of recent cumulative losses in the us and upon consideration of all other available evidence  both positive and negative  using a more likely than not standard in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
as of the end of the third quarter of  we concluded that a valuation allowance against these assets is no longer necessary as we are no longer in  nor are we expecting to be in  a cumulative loss in the forseeable future 
also  in appropriate circumstances we have the opportunity to undertake a tax planning strategy to ensure that our deferred tax assets do not expire unutilized 
this strategy is based upon our ability to make a tax election to capitalize certain expenses that will result in generating taxable income to allow us to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
we would undertake such a strategy to realize these deferred tax assets prior to expiration only if we determined it was reasonable  prudent  and feasible 
this  along with other positive evidence  such as our recent history of positive taxable income  led us to conclude in that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
in  we incurred a million net operating loss for german income tax purposes 
under german law  tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely 
we also incurred a million net operating loss in one of our chinese entities which has a year life 
we believe that we will generate sufficient taxable income in both jurisdictions such that both of these carryforwards should be fully realized 
further  our effective tax rate benefited from the tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china  which expired at the end of under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate followed by a reduced tax rate in subsequent years that gradually increased to the full rate of tax beginning in in  rsz reported pretax income of million which was subject to the full tax rate of 
in  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a reduced tax rate of 
also  under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd

in  rsh reported pretax income of million which was subject to a reduced tax rate of 
backlog the backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase at the end of was primarily related to the ces operating segment  which experienced an increase in backlog of million at december  as compared to december  vs 
net sales net sales in were million  an increase of from million of sales in sales included approximately million related to curamik  which was acquired at the beginning of excluding curamik  organic growth was approximately million  or 
this sales increase was attributable to volume improvement across all of our core strategic segments  led by high performance foams  which increased by from million in to million in  printed circuit materials  which increased by from million in to million in  and the power distribution systems segment  which increased by from million in to million in a primary driver of these increases was the strong demand for the industry leading products and materials produced by these segments  particularly over the first nine months of  as volumes declined in the fourth quarter 
additional factors impacting these results are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
gross margin gross margin decreased by approximately from in to in during  margins were impacted by several factors  many of which were anticipated and planned for by management 
most notably  such factors included the start up costs associated with our new pcm manufacturing facility in suzhou  china  and our pds operations in north america  increased costs of certain raw materials used in many of our production processes  and unfavorable product sales mix in certain segments 
as we move into the production phase in these new production facilities  we expect the start up and qualification costs to decline and margins to improve over time 
also  margins were negatively impacted by the acquisition of curamik  which has historically operated at lower margins than our legacy operations 
however  curamik has lower operating costs  so overall profitability is very similar to our core businesses 
further  margins were negatively impacted by a one time charge of approximately million recorded in the first quarter of related to the write up of curamik inventory to fair value  as required under the purchase accounting rules 
sequentially  margins improved over the first three quarter of  but declined significantly in the fourth quarter due to the decline in sales and a negative impact from inventory absorption 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative s a expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in expenses is partially attributable to the acquisition of curamik  which added approximately million of expense during the year including million of costs incurred to acquire the business and approximately million in amortization expense related to the intangible assets created as part of the purchase 
also contributing to the increase were approximately million in one time charges incurred in the fourth quarter of associated with the acceleration of compensation expense related to the change of chief executive officers during the quarter 
further contributing to the increase in s a were incremental sales and marketing costs of approximately million incurred to support the higher sales volumes and future growth initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by a net decline in incentive and equity compensation costs of approximately million  as well as declines in spending in certain areas as a result of the cost control measures that were in place due to the recession 
as a percentage of sales  overall selling and administrative expense declined significantly to in from in this decline was partially driven by our ability to grow sales organically and absorb a significant acquisition in curamik without materially increasing our s a spending 
also  curamik overall operating costs are lower as a percentage of sales than our legacy segments costs  which contributed to the percentage decline 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  from million in as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in and in historically  we have targeted a r d investment as a percentage of net sales  however  with our sales growth we believe that our short term r d investment rate will be in the range 
restructuring and impairment charges in the first quarter of  we signed an agreement to sell our facility in richmond  virginia for million 
we acquired this facility as part of the mti acquisition and subsequently moved operations from richmond to our high performance foams manufacturing facility in carol stream  illinois  so the facility was vacant and has been classified as held for sale since this facility had a book value of approximately million prior to the signing of the agreement  and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  which represents the write down to the selling price less approximately million of estimated selling costs 
equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures was million in  a decrease of million from million in results included approximately million of equity income related to the rcct joint venture  which was divested in the fourth quarter of the remaining year over year decrease is attributable to a decline in performance at our foam joint ventures  rogers inoac suzhou ris in china and rogers inoac corporation ric in japan 
other income expense  net other income was million in  an increase of million from million in the increase is primarily due to a gain of approximately million on the sale of a building in china  partially offset by an unfavorable impact of million related to foreign currency fluctuations and our related hedging program 
also  results included commission income of million from pls  which ended operations during the year 
realized gain loss realized gain loss is the portion of the auction rate security impairment that relates to credit losses and is required to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income loss 
the amount of loss recognized in was million  a decrease from the million loss recognized in the change was attributable to market conditions surrounding the securities underlying the auction rate securities  as well as redemption of a tranche of auction rate securities during at less than par value 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net was million of interest income in and million of interest expense in the interest expense in was primarily due to the recognition of million of expense related to our long term debt obligations resulting from the funding of the curamik acquisition in the first quarter of additionally  in  we incurred approximately million of expense associated with a capital lease obligation that we acquired as part of the curamik acquisition 
no such debt obligation existed in income tax expense benefit our effective tax rate was in and in in both and  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with certain discrete rate items recorded during the year and also benefited from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity 
in  our effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the release of a portion of the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we developed a tax planning strategy that would allow us to recognize certain deferred tax assets  resulting in a partial reduction of our valuation allowance 
this strategy is based upon our ability to make a tax election to capitalize certain expenses that will result in generating taxable income to allow us to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
we would undertake such a strategy to realize these deferred tax assets prior to expiration only if we determined it was reasonable  prudent  and feasible 
in both and  we had cumulative losses in the us as the realization of deferred taxes is principally dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment  we concluded that given the weight of both positive and negative evidence  a valuation allowance should be placed against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets  for which there is neither a tax planning strategy nor source of taxable income against which it would offset 
our tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china expired at the end of under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate followed by a reduced tax rate in subsequent years that gradually increased to the full rate of tax beginning in in  rsz reported pretax income of million which was subject to a tax rate of

in  rsh reported pretax income of million which was subject to a tax rate of 
backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the decrease at the end of was primarily related to the decreased customer demand across almost all of our businesses  with the largest impact at pds  which experienced a decrease in backlog of million at december  as compared to december  segment sales and operations core strategic high performance foams dollars in millions net sales operating income loss the high performance foams hpf operating segment is comprised of polyurethane and silicone foam products  which are sold into a wide variety of markets for various applications  such as portable communications  consumer electronics  and mass transit markets for gaskets  sealing  and cushioning applications 
vs 
net sales increased by from million in to million in this improvement was driven by strong sales of the segment newest product introduction  poron xrd extreme impact materials for molded applications  which added million in incremental sales in  as well as a improvement in sales into general industrial applications  including protective cases for mobile internet devices and automotive and hybrid electric vehicles 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales into the wind and solar markets  which declined in as compared to operating income declined by from million in to million in results included approximately million of special charges  including million related to the shutdown of the silicone foams manufacturing facility in bremen  germany  million of net severance related charges as a result of our streamlining initiatives  million in allocated pension settlement charges as further described in the selling and administrative expenses section above and million of allocated asbestos charges as further described in in the selling and administrative expenses section above 
results included approximately million of special charges primarily associated with its allocated portion of the acceleration of compensation expense related to the change of chief executive officers during the year 
excluding these special charges  operating income increased by approximately from to on a increase in sales due in part to lower costs as a result of the streamlining initiatives  which created better operating leverage on lower sales volumes  as well as an overall favorable sales mix 
these favorable results were partially offset by approximately million of incremental costs incurred in as compared to related to the startup of the poron xrd molded foam product line 
vs 
net sales in this segment increased by  from million in to million in operating profits increased significantly as well  improving by approximately from million in to million in the results include approximately million of integration costs associated with the acquisition of utis in the second quarter of results were driven by strong demand for the segment foams across almost all product lines and in geographic regions 
in particular  we continued to experience success with our polyurethane foam products in cushioning  sealing and energy management for portable electronic devices  particularly large touch screen mobile internet devices 
sales of our silicone foams gained momentum in due to increased demand in various markets  including aircraft  communications infrastructure  solar power  and hybrid electric vehicle applications 
hpf also gained traction in one of its newest product lines  poron molded components  primarily for applications in sports and impact apparel  as well as mobile internet devices 
like most of our other segments  hpf experienced a decline in sales volumes in the fourth quarter of  which we believe was driven by the rationalizing of inventory in the marketplace  as well as global economic trends 
printed circuit materials dollars in millions net sales operating income loss the printed circuit materials pcm operating segment is comprised of high frequency circuit material products used for making circuitry that receive  process and transmit high frequency communications signals  in a wide variety of markets and applications  including wireless communications  high reliability  and automotive  among others 
vs 
net sales in were million  a decline of from million in the decline was due primarily to a decline in sales into high reliability applications  as well as a decline into the satellite tv market for lnb low noise blockdown converters 
these declines were partially offset by a increase in sales into the automotive market primarily for radar safety sensor applications  as our laminate products continue to gain traction in the market  as well as a increase in sales in new base station antenna applications for communications infrastructure 
operating income declined by from million in to million in results included approximately million of net special charges comprised primarily of million in severance charges incurred as part of our overall streamlining initiatives  million in charges related to pension settlement accounting as further described in the selling and administrative expenses section above  and million of allocated asbestos charges as further described in in the selling and administrative expenses section above 
these charges were partially offset by a one time benefit of million related to inventory valuation adjustments and million related to an insurance reimbursement of a previously settled product liability claim 
results included approximately million of special charges primarily associated with its allocated portion of the acceleration of compensation expense related to the change of chief executive officers during the year 
excluding these special charges  operating income decreased by approximately from million in to million in this decline is primarily attributable to the decline in sales volumes  as well as the impact from the decrease in inventory during the year 
these declines were partially offset by lower spending as a result of our streamlining initiatives 
vs 
net sales in this segment increased by in to million from million in  while operating income remained relatively flat year over year 
results included a one time benefit of million from the recovery of insurance proceeds related to the calamp lawsuit  which had been previously settled in in  the segments growth was driven by strong demand in the wireless infrastructure market  primarily due to expansion of third generation g and fourth generation g systems globally  as well as for antenna radar applications for the high reliability and automotive markets 
demand was also strong for materials used in the aerospace  defense and other high reliability markets  as well as in the automotive market for radar safety sensors and in satellite televisions 
at the end of  particularly in the fourth quarter  sales in this segment declined significantly from levels achieved in the first three quarters of the year 
we believe this decline was driven by global economic trends  as well as the rationalization of inventory in the supply chain 
power electronics solutions curamik electronics solutions dollars in millions net sales operating income loss the curamik electronics solutions ces operating segment is comprised of power electronic substrate products  which are used primarily in the design of intelligent power management devices  such as igbt insulated gate bipolar transistor modules that enable a wide range of products including highly efficient industrial motor drives  wind and solar energy converters and electrical systems in automobiles 
we acquired the business on january  vs 
on a year to date basis  net sales declined by from million in to million in this decline was due primarily to the continued lower demand in renewable energy and industrial motor drive applications  which declined and  respectively  in as compared to  as well as further inventory corrections in the supply chain 
we believe that these markets will remain at these levels for the near term  but the long term outlook remains positive 
also contributing to the decline in sales is the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  which contributed approximately million to the overall sales decline as the usd appreciated against the euro by approximately during as compared to the segment transacted approximately in in euro as compared to in as ces works through this current downturn  we continue to look for ways to improve the segment cost structure and better serve our customers 
early in the third quarter of  we announced a plan to relocate the final inspection operations from our facility in eschenbach  germany to hungary 
the move is expected to enable more cost effective performance of the inspecting operations 
we expect the move to be complete in overall  operating results declined from operating income of million in to an operating loss of million in results included approximately million of special charges consisting primarily of the following million in severance charges related to the move to hungary as described above  million in severance related charges as part of the company streamlining initiatives  million related to the reserve of an uncollectible receivable  million related to the allocated portion of one time asbestos charges as further described in the selling and administrative expenses section above  and million in charges related to pension settlement accounting as further described in the selling and administrative expenses section above 
excluding these charges  ces operating loss for was million 
this overall decline in results can be directly attributable to the decline in volumes and the associated contribution loss on those sales  partially offset by lower spending as a result of our streamlining initiatives 
vs 
net sales in this segment were million in and operating profits were million 
these volumes represent a record for the segment  and its performance for the year exceeded our initial expectations with sequential growth in the first three quarters of the year  followed by a decline in sales in the fourth quarter as experienced by all of our core segments 
the overall results were driven by strong demand for the segments products across its primary markets  which consist of energy efficient motor drives  wind and solar power generations  and hev eb applications  and regions  which include europe and japan 
at the end of the year  the decline in volumes was due primarily to lower demand in wind and general industrial applications  as well as from customers reducing their inventory levels 
curamik operating results included approximately million of one time costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the business  including consulting  legal and audit fees  as well as severance charges and other integration costs 
results also included approximately million of non cash amortization charges related to the intangible assets created as part of the purchase of the business see note to the consolidated financial statements in the form k and approximately million of one time non cash charges related to the amortization of the step up of inventory to its fair value at the acquisition date

vs 
net sales in were million  a decline of from million in the decline was due primarily to the significant slowdown in spending on infrastructure projects in the mass transit and renewable energy markets  particularly in europe and china  as sales declined by and  respectively  in those regions 
also  overall sales into the renewable energy market declined by as the wind and solar energy markets continue to lag 
these declines were partially offset by strong sales into the mass transit and automotive markets in north america  which increased in total by in as compared to operating results declined from operating income of million in to an operating loss of million in results included million of special charges comprised primarily of million of charges related to the shut down of manufacturing operations in north america  million of other severance and allocated pension settlement related charges as further described in the selling and administrative expenses section above  and million of allocated asbestos charges as further described in in the selling and administrative expenses section above 
the remaining decline in operating performance can be primarily attributable to the lost contribution related to the decline in sales volumes described above  partially offset by lower spending as a result of our streamlining initiatives 
vs 
net sales in this segment increased by from million in to million in  while operating profit increased from million in to million in these increases were driven by strong demand over the first nine months of the year for this segment products in mass transit and power electronic applications 
in the fourth quarter of  this segment began experiencing softening sales in mass transit and wind turbines 
in particular  the pds segment experienced lower demand for its products in the fourth quarter due primarily to the temporary suspension of railway construction investments by the ministry of railways mor in china as a result of their debt issues and the safety investigation initiated after a train crash in wenzhou  zhejiang province in july  in which two high speed bullet trains collided 
the mor had decided to continue the railway investment plans but at a slightly slower pace than their initial plan 
china also addressed the issues with wind and solar energy connections to the grid  all of which are unrelated to the performance of our products 
other dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our other reportable segment consists of our elastomer rollers and floats products  as well as the inverter distribution business 
in the second quarter of  we decided to cease production of non woven composite materials products in an effort to redeploy resources to focus on our core strategic segments 
at december   manufacturing operations have been shut down and final sales are expected to occur in the first quarter of additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we also ended operations at our thermal management solutions tms operating segment 
these operating segments are being treated as a discontinued operations and their results are no longer included in this reportable segment 
all prior periods have been recast to reflect such changes 
vs net sales declined from million to million the decline in sales is primarily due to a decline in sales of inverter products from our legacy durel business  which was partially offset by a increase in sales of elastomer component and float products 
operating results improved by from an operating profit of million in to million in results included approximately million of special charges related primarily to allocated severance and pension settlement related costs 
the improvement in operating profit is due primarily to the operating performance of the elastomer component and float products  which improved by due to increased volumes and other cost reduction initiatives 
vs 
in  sales in the segment declined by approximately from million in to million in results included approximately million in sales from distribution activities related to our former joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc of japan  polyimide laminate systems  llc pls distribution activities  which reached end of life in the remainder of the decline was related to the further decline in the electroluminescent lamps el sales 
however  even though volumes declined  operating profit improved from million in to million in the improvement was driven by sales of inverter products  offset by the end of the pls distribution sales

discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  we made the strategic decision to end the operations of our tms operating segment 
we had invested in its operations for the last few years  but had difficulty gaining traction in the market and working through issues in the manufacturing process 
therefore  we determined that we would not achieve future success in this operation and chose to shut down operations rather than invest further 
for the years ended december   and  operating losses of million  million and million  net of tax  respectively  were reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income loss

the tax related to the discontinued operations was immaterial for and was million and million of tax expense for december  and  respectively 
in the second quarter of  we decided to cease production of our non woven composite materials operating segment located in rogers  connecticut in an effort to redeploy resources to focus more on our core strategic operations 
sales of non woven products have been steadily declining for several years and totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  manufacturing operations were complete by the end of and last sales out of inventory are expected to end in the first quarter of for the year ended december   operating loss of million and for the year ended december  and  operating losses of million and million  net of tax  respectively  were reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income loss

product and market development our research and development team is dedicated to growing our business by developing cost effective solutions that enable or improve upon the performance of customers products  as well as identifying business and technology acquisition opportunities to expand our market presence 
our long term plan is to invest in the range of of net sales annually into research and development 
currently  r d spend is in the of sales range  however  going forward  we plan to invest more in r d activities as we work to grow the company both organically and through external investments 
liquidity  capital resources and financial position we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental strengths 
while the us financial markets have grown more stable since the global recession of  significant volatility still remains in the global markets  particularly in europe 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash flows that are expected to be generated from our operations  together with our available credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures  research and development efforts  and debt service commitments  as well as our other operating and investing needs  for at least the next twelve months 
we continue to have access to the remaining portion of the line of credit available under the amended credit agreement as defined in the credit facilities section which follows  as amended  should any issue or strategic opportunities arise 
we continually review and evaluate the adequacy of our cash flows  borrowing facilities and banking relationships to ensure that we have the appropriate access to cash to fund both our near term operating needs and our long term strategic initiatives

this increase was due primarily to the following i liquidation of the auction rate securities portfolio  resulting in net proceeds of million  ii million received for stock option exercises  iii million received for the sale of our facility in richmond  virginia  and iv cash generated from operations 
these increases in cash were partially offset by cash outlays of i million in contributions to our defined benefit pension plan  ii million of payments on our debt facility  iii a million pension retirement payout to the former ceo  and iv million of annual incentive compensation payments related to performance 
the following table illustrates the location of our cash and cash equivalents by our three major geographic areas as of the periods indicated dollars in thousands us europe asia total cash and cash equivalents cash held in certain foreign locations could be subject to additional taxes if we repatriated such amounts back to the us from foreign countries that have a lower tax rate than in the us our current policy is that the historical earnings and cash in these locations will be permanently reinvested in those foreign locations 
working capital was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
significant changes in our balance sheet accounts from december  to december  are as follows inventories decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease is primarily attributable to our focus on working capital management and lowering inventory levels to better match current demand 
long term marketable securities  which represents the value of auction rate securities  had a balance of million at december  these securities were completely liquidated during as of december   we do not have any long term marketable securities on our balance sheet 
long term asbestos related insurance receivables increased from million at december  to million at december  and asbestos related liabilities increased from million at december  to million at december  these increases are due to the change in the forecast period for asbestos related claims from years to years  which occurred in the fourth quarter of overall  our debt position declined by million from million at december  to million at december  due to payments made on the facilities during long term debt decreased by million from million at december  to million at december   while the current portion of long term debt increased by million from million at december  to million at december  this increase in the short term portion of the debt is due to management anticipating additional voluntary principal payments combined with an increase in the scheduled payments for our debt facility over the next twelve months 
accrued employee benefits and compensation decreased by from million at december  to million at december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the million decline in the accrual for the annual incentive compensation plan in as compared to during  we had million of net cash provided by investing activities as compared to million of net cash used in investing activities in and million in of net cash used in investing activities

capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million in and net cash provided by financing activities were million and million in and  respectively 
was impacted by the initial draw on the line of credit for million to fund the acquisition of curamik 
credit facilities on july   we entered into an amended and restated million secured five year credit agreement 
this credit agreement amended credit agreement is with i jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  ii hsbc bank usa  national association  iii rbs citizens  national association  iv fifth third bank  and v citibank  na jpmorgan securities llc and hsbc bank usa  national association acted as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers  hsbc bank usa  national association and rbs citizens  national association acted as co syndication agents  and fifth third bank and citibank  na acted as co documentation agents 
the amended credit agreement amends and restates the credit agreement signed between the company and the same banks on november  and increased our borrowing capacity from million under the original agreement to million under the amended credit agreement 
key features of the amended credit agreement  as compared to the november  credit agreement  include an increase in credit from million to million with the addition of a million term loan  the extension of maturity from november  to july   a basis point reduction in interest costs  an increase in the size of permitted acquisitions from million to million  and an increase in permitted additional indebtedness from million to million 
the amended credit agreement provides for the extension of credit in the form of a million term loan which refinances outstanding borrowings in the amount of million from the existing revolving credit line  as further described below  and up to million of revolving loans  in multiple currencies  at any time and from time to time until the maturity of the amended credit agreement  on july  we may borrow  pre pay and re borrow amounts under the million revolving portion of the amended credit agreement  however  with respect to the million term loan portion  any principal amounts re paid may not be re borrowed 
borrowings may be used to finance working capital needs  for letters of credit and for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business  including the financing of permitted acquisitions as defined in the amended credit agreement 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement will bear interest based on one of two options 
alternate base rate loans will bear interest that includes a base reference rate plus a spread of basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
the base reference rate will be the greater of the prime rate  federal funds effective rate plus basis points  and adjusted month london interbank offered libo rate plus basis points 
eurocurrency loans will bear interest based on the adjusted libo rate plus a spread of basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
in addition to interest payable on the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the amended credit agreement  the company is required to pay a quarterly fee of to based upon its leverage ratio of the unused amount of the lenders commitments under the amended credit agreement 
in connection with the amended credit agreement  we transferred borrowings in the amount of million from the revolving credit line under the november  credit agreement to the term loan under the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement requires the mandatory quarterly repayment of principal of amounts borrowed under such term loan 
payments commenced on september   and are scheduled to be completed on june  the aggregate payments due are as follows million million million million million million the amended credit agreement is secured by many of the assets of rogers and our world properties  inc  subsidiary  including but not limited to  receivables  equipment  intellectual property  inventory  stock in certain subsidiaries and real property 
as part of the amended credit agreement  we are restricted in our ability to perform certain actions  including  but not limited to  our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt  sell certain assets  and make capital expenditures  with certain exceptions 
further  we are required to maintain certain financial covenant ratios  including a leverage ratio of no more than to and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio fccr of to this ratio measures the company ability to cover its fixed charge obligations 
the key components of fixed charges are capital expenditures  scheduled debt payments  capital lease payments  income taxes paid in cash  rent and interest expenses 
in the first quarter of  through an amendment to the amended credit agreement  the fccr was modified from to of adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda 
several factors contributed to the need for an amendment to this covenant 
the ratio was based on a more robust set of financial projections  and these have moderated to some extent with the recent events in the marketplace and the overall global economy  particularly in europe and china 
additionally  there were no mandatory term loan payments when the original ratio was determined  which would further stress the ratio 
finally  we forecasted an increase in planned capital investment to support certain strategic initiatives  which added pressure to the ratio as well 
relevant fixed charge metrics are detailed in the table below 
periods q q q q q covenant limit minimum actual fccr as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants  as we achieved actual ratios of approximately on the leverage ratio and on the fixed charge coverage ratio 
if an event of default occurs  the lenders may  among other things  terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees 
we are in compliance with all financial and other covenants as of december  in connection with the establishment of the initial credit in  we capitalized approximately million of debt issuance costs and  in connection with the amended credit agreement  as amended  we capitalized an additional million of debt issuance costs in these costs will be amortized over the life of the amended credit agreement  as amended  which will terminate in june we incurred amortization expense of million for the years ended and  respectively 
at december   we have approximately million of credit facility costs remaining to be amortized 
in the first quarter of  we made an initial draw on the line of credit of million to fund the acquisition of curamik 
during  we made principal payments of million on the debt 
we made million of principal payments in fiscal we are obligated to pay million on this debt obligation and are scheduling million of discretionary revolver payments within the next months 
as of december   our outstanding debt related to the amended credit agreement  as amended  consists of million of term loan debt and million on the revolving line of credit 
we have the option to pay part of or the entire amount at any time over the remaining life of the amended credit agreement  as amended  with any balance due and payable at the agreement expiration 
in addition  as of december  we had the following standby letter of credit loc and guarantees that were backed by the amended credit agreement  as amended million letter of credit to guarantee rogers workers compensation plan  million letter guarantee to guarantee a payable obligation for a chinese subsidiary rogers suzhou  million letter guarantee to guarantee a payable obligation for a chinese subsidiary rogers suzhou 
interest we incurred interest expense on our outstanding debt of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we incurred an unused commitment fee of approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  in july  we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the variable interest rate on of the term loan debt  then outstanding  effective july at december   the term loan debt amounted to million of our total outstanding debt of million 
at december   the rate charged on this debt is the month libor at plus a spread of 
we also incurred interest expense on the capital lease of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital lease during the first quarter of  we recorded a capital lease obligation related to the acquisition of curamik for its primary manufacturing facility in eschenbach  germany 
we have an option to purchase the property in either or upon the expiration of the lease in at a price which is the greater of i the then current market value or ii the fiscal residual book value of the land including the buildings and installations thereon 
the total obligation recorded for the lease as of december  is million 
depreciation expense related to the capital lease was million for the years ending december  and these expenses are included as depreciation expense in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income loss 
interest expense related to the debt recorded on the capital lease is included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of income loss 
see interest section above for further discussion 
auction rate securities during the first quarter of  we liquidated our auction rate securities portfolio  receiving net proceeds of million on a stated par value of million 
as a result of this liquidation  we recognized a loss on the discount of the securities of million the remaining difference between the liquidation proceeds and par value of million had previously been recognized as an impairment loss 
since the markets for these securities failed in the first quarter of  we had already redeemed million of these securities  mostly at par 
however  due to the fact that par value redemptions had recently slowed with no clear path for full redemption over the next several years and the rate of return on these securities was very low  management determined that a discounted redemption of the remainder of the portfolio was in the best financial interests of the company 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases capital lease interest payments on capital lease inventory purchase obligation capital commitments pension and retiree health and life insurance benefits outstanding borrowings on credit facilities interest payments on outstanding borrowings total pension benefit payments  which amount to million  are expected to be paid through the utilization of pension plan assets  retiree health and life insurance benefits  which amount to million  are expected to be paid from operating cash flows 
estimated future interest payments are based on rates that range from to  which take into consideration projected forward libor rates  a leverage based spread and the related impact of the interest rate swap 
other long term liabilities  such as deferred taxes  unrecognized tax benefits and asbestos related product liability reserves  have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our business  sales  or operating results during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are  in the opinion of management  reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and believe that appropriate reserves have been established based on reasonable methodologies and appropriate assumptions based on facts and circumstances that are known  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that are highly judgmental and uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates could reasonably have been used  or if changes to those estimates are reasonably likely to periodically occur that could affect the amounts carried in the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until either the customer has received the goods or they have passed through customs  depending on the circumstances 
as appropriate  we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and warranty claims 
provisions for such allowances are made at the time of sale and are typically derived from historical trends and other relevant information 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectability of receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances when we are made aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously mentioned 
the remainder of the reserve is based on our estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of our customer base 
the risk with this estimate is associated with failure to become aware of potential collectability issues related to specific accounts and thereby becoming exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  our estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and we have processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
additionally  we have credit insurance on certain accounts that mitigates some of the risk of loss 
over the past three years  our allowance as a percentage of total receivables has ranged from to 
a basis point increase in our current year allowance to receivable ratio would increase our allowance reserve by approximately million 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs determined primarily on a first in first out basis 
we also maintain a reserve for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory that is primarily developed by utilizing both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for our analysis 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
in general  most products that have been held in inventory greater than one year are fully reserved unless there are mitigating circumstances  including forecasted sales or current orders for the product 
the remainder of the allowance is based on our estimates  and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unexpected decline in current production 
we closely monitor the market place and related inventory levels and have historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  we value certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the link chain index method and is maintained to properly value these inventories 
our obsolescence reserve has ranged from to of gross inventory over the last three years 
a one hundred basis point increase to the december  obsolescence reserve would increase the reserve by approximately million 
goodwill and other intangibles we have made acquisitions over the years that included the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may have been impaired 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates  and future market conditions  among others 
we review goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the implied fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its implied fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
in  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows 
we believe this approach yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value as our reporting units are not easily compared to other corporations involved in similar businesses 
we further believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of the year 
however  since the curamik electronics solutions operating segment also a reporting unit as defined for this test results declined substantially in as compared to  we determined that this decline was an indicator of impairment and performed an interim impairment test as of september  in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  we chose to perform step of the goodwill impairment test  which compared the fair value of the curamik electronics solutions operating segment to its carrying amount including goodwill and definite and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the fair value of the operating segment was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on our most recent forecasts of the business  taking into consideration macro economic and other market trends known to us at that time 
based on this model  we determined that the fair value of the operating segment exceeded its carrying amount by approximately and that no impairment of goodwill existed as of september  from a sensitivity perspective  if the fair value of the curamik electronics solutions operating segment declined by  the fair value of the operating unit would exceed the carrying value by approximately 
these amounts are both significantly lower than the calculation performed in the fourth quarter of our annual impairment test date  which yielded a fair value that was approximately in excess of the operating segment carrying value  which reflects the current decline in the segment results 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the assumptions utilized in the third quarter of discounted cash flow model and no facts or circumstances existed that would cause us to change any of the underlying assumptions in that original model 
therefore  we concluded that no impairment existed as of december  ces had approximately million of goodwill associated with it at december  we believe that the assumptions and rates used in the impairment test related to curamik electronics solutions are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include a discount rate of  terminal growth rate of  sales growth rate that ranges from to with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately over the projected period  and an improving operating profit margin driven by current streamlining initiatives and better leverage on growing sales volumes 
these assumptions are based on our current understanding of the markets  products and customers of curamik electronics solutions  as well as projections for raw material prices  sales prices  and incremental cost streamlining initiatives  among others  over the period of the discounted cash flow model 
if we fail to achieve the forecasted growth rates or the margin improvements assumed in the model or other assumptions utilized in the model need to be modified  the operating segment fair value could become less than its carrying value  resulting in a future impairment of goodwill  other intangibles and other long lived assets of the operating segment 
for the two other reporting units with goodwill and intangible assets  high performance foams and elastomer components division ecd  the impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of the hpf and ecd reporting units had allocated goodwill of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  no impairment charges resulted from this analysis 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for these reporting units was for hpf and for ecd 
from a sensitivity perspective  if the fair value of these operating segments declined by  the fair value of the hpf operating segment would exceed its carrying value by approximately and the fair value of the ecd operating segment would exceed its carrying value by approximately 
these valuations are based on a five year discounted cash flow analysis  which utilized a discount rate of approximately and a terminal year growth rate of 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  customer relationships  work force  and the like  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
values assigned to intangible assets are determined based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired  the value of the acquired businesses customer base  as well as the value of its existing work force  among others 
these assets are reviewed at least annually  or more frequently  if facts and circumstances surrounding such assets indicate a possible impairment of the asset exists 
in  there were no indicators of impairment on any of our other intangible assets associated with the hpf and ecd operating segments 
the intangible assets associated with the ces operating segment were tested in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment analysis performed during the third quarter of and it was determined that no impairment existed on these assets as a result of that analysis 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment  and other long term assets  including investments  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their market value determined by either a quoted market price  if available  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
in the future  deterioration in our business could result in additional impairment charges 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may decrease 
in these situations  we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 
environmental contingencies we accrue for environmental investigation  remediation  operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for environmental matters  the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
for sites with multiple potential responsible parties prps  we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the low end of the range is accrued 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded for the estimated insurance reimbursement amount 
we are exposed to the uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates will not reflect the final outcome of a matter 
product liability and workers compensation costs workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim and accrued at that time 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
in other countries where workers compensation claims are applicable  we typically maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
for product liability claims  we typically maintain insurance coverage with reasonable deductible levels to protect us from potential exposures 
any liability associated with such claims is based on management best estimate of the potential claim value  while insurance receivables associated with related claims are not recorded until verified by the insurance carrier 
for asbestos related claims  we recognize projected asbestos liabilities and related insurance receivables  with any difference between the liability and related insurance receivable recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income loss 
in order to determine projected asbestos related liabilities  we have historically engaged national economic research associates  inc nera  a consulting firm with expertise in the field of evaluating mass tort litigation asbestos bodily injury claims 
further  in order to determine the projected insurance coverage on the asbestos liabilities  we have historically engaged marsh usa  inc  also known as marsh risk consulting marsh  to develop these projections 
projecting future asbestos costs and related insurance coverage is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict  including the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
the models developed for determining the potential exposure and related insurance coverage were developed by outside consultants deemed to be experts in their respective fields with the forecast for asbestos related liabilities generated by nera and the related insurance receivable projections developed by marsh 
the models contain numerous assumptions that significantly impact the results generated by the models 
we believe the assumptions made are reasonable at the present time  but are subject to uncertainty based on the actual future outcome of our asbestos litigation 
historically  due to the inherent uncertainties of the forecast process and our limited amount of settlement and claims history  we utilized a forecast period of five years  which we concluded was the most reasonable period for recognizing a reserve for projected asbestos liabilities  and that costs that might be incurred after that period were not reasonably estimable at that time 
in  we reviewed this assumption and determined that it was appropriate to extend the forecast period from five years to years 
we reached this conclusion due to the fact that we now have considerably more experience in addressing asbestos related lawsuits and have a longer history of activity to use as a baseline to more accurately project the liability over a longer period than previously disclosed 
further  settlement trends have become more meaningful in recent years and we believe that we now have a more meaningful history of data on which to base our projections 
further  we determined that a year projection period is now appropriate as  although we have a longer and more consistent history of data over the last few years  we do not believe we have sufficient data to justify a longer projection period at this time 
as of december   the estimated liability and estimated insurance recovery for the ten year period through was million and million  respectively  resulting in an additional charge of million recognized in the fourth quarter of million was previously recognized throughout 
for sensitivity purposes  if the forecast period was decreased to five years  the projected liability and related insurance recovery would be million and million  respectively 
also  if the forecast period was increased to fifteen years  the projected liability and related insurance recovery would be million and million  respectively 
given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections  we plan to have the projections of current and future asbestos claims periodically re examined  and we will update them further if needed based on our experience  changes in the underlying assumptions that formed the basis for nera and marsh models  and other relevant factors  such as changes in the tort system 
there can be no assurance that our accrued asbestos liabilities will approximate our actual asbestos related settlement and defense costs  or that our accrued insurance recoveries will be realized 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that we will incur additional charges for our asbestos liabilities and defense costs in the future  which could exceed existing reserves  but cannot reasonably estimate such excess amounts at this time 
legal contingencies from time to time we are a defendant in legal matters  including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed in more detail above 
as required by us gaap  we determine whether an amount with respect to a loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated 
separately  we would analyze any potential insurance proceeds that would be available to offset the claim amounts 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with internal and external counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the ultimate outcome of such litigation could be more or less than original estimates 
final resolution of such matters could negatively effect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide various defined benefit pension plans for our us employees and sponsor three defined benefit health care plans and a life insurance plan 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term rates of return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
the assumptions used were determined as follows i the discount rate used is based on comparisons to various indexes  particularly the citigroup bond index  ii the salary growth rate is based on our historical and projected level of salary increases  and iii the long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  market conditions and our expectations of future returns 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
the rates used to determine our costs and obligations under our pension and postretirement plans are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics 
for the year ended december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our total pension expense by approximately million and a basis point reduction in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased our total pension expense by approximately million 
income taxes the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current fiscal year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding i the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  ii expected future taxable income  and iii the impact of tax planning strategies 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
it is our policy that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
if circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries will not be indefinitely reinvested  provision for the tax consequences  if any  will be recorded in the period circumstances change 
we do provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our japanese high performance foams joint venture 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income loss 
determining the amount of stock based compensation expense to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates for the following assumptions expected volatility in determining expected volatility  we consider a number of factors  including historical volatility and implied volatility 
expected term we use historical employee exercise data to estimate the expected term assumption for the black scholes valuation model 
risk free interest rate we use the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period commensurate with the expected term assumption as the risk free interest rate 
expected dividend yield we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock  therefore  a dividend yield of was used in the black scholes model 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested stock based awards as of december  the rate of represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period 
this analysis is re evaluated annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk foreign operations our financial results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we do business 
our primary overseas markets are in europe and asia  thus exposing us to exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the euro and the various currencies used in the far east 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
we further mitigate this exposure through hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties when the use of natural hedges is not possible or desirable 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we monitor foreign exchange risks and at times manage such risks on specific transactions 
our risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in an approximate increase decrease to sales and net income of million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk during the first quarter of  we borrowed million against our existing credit facilities to finance the strategic acquisition of curamik electronics gmbh 
therefore  we are exposed to interest rate risk  as the interest charged on our facility fluctuates with movements in the benchmark libor rate 
in  in order to limit the exposure to upward movement in interest rates  we entered into an interest rate swap  which will take effect in july this instrument caps our exposure to upward movements in rates at on of the outstanding debt 
any movement in rates above this level would be offset by gains related on the swap 
at december   the effective rate of interest we are paying on the debt facility approximates 
based on our current outstanding debt of million  a basis point increase in the libor rate would increase the amount of interest expense by million  annually 
however  that increase would fully impact only of the debt  while effective libor on the other is capped at commodity risk we are subject to fluctuations in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our materials and products 
in particular  we are exposed to market fluctuations in commodity pricing as we utilize certain materials  such as copper and ceramic  that are key materials in certain of our products 
in order to minimize the risk of market driven price changes in these commodities  we utilize hedging strategies to insulate us against price fluctuations of copper  the commodity most used in our manufacturing processes 
we currently do not use hedging strategies to minimize the risk of price fluctuations on other commodity based raw materials  however  we continue to review such strategies to hedge market risk in the future 
for additional discussion on our market risk  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k
