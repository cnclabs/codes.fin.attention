our goal is to provide simple  reliable and affordable storage solutions for consumer and enterprise use in a wide variety of formats and devices 
we sell our products globally to oem and retail customers 
we design  develop and manufacture data storage solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory  proprietary controller and firmware technologies 
our flash based products enable businesses and consumers to efficiently and effectively capture  share  use and preserve digital content 
our solutions include ssds  removable cards  embedded products  usb drives  digital media players  wafers and components 
our ssd products are used in client computing platforms and enterprise data centers to provide high speed  high capacity storage solutions that can be used in lieu of  or in conjunction with  hard disk drives 
our removable cards are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones  tablets  digital cameras  gaming devices and pcs 
our embedded flash products are used in mobile phones  tablets  thin and light laptops  ereaders  global positioning system  or gps  devices  gaming systems  imaging devices and computing platforms 
we believe the markets for flash storage are generally price elastic  meaning that a decrease in the price per gigabyte results in increased demand for higher capacities and the emergence of new applications for flash storage 
we strive to continuously reduce the cost of nand flash memory in order to enable us to profitably grow our business  supply a diverse set of customers and channels  and continue to grow our markets 
a key component of our ability to reduce the cost of nand flash memory is our ability to continue to transition our nand flash memory process technology to smaller nodes 
we currently expect to be able to continue to scale our nand flash memory through a few additional generations  but beyond that there is no certainty that further technology scaling can be achieved cost effectively with the current nand flash memory architecture 
we continue to invest in future generations of nand flash memory  and we are also pursuing alternative technologies  such as bics and d reram technologies  which we believe may be a viable alternative to nand flash memory when nand flash memory can no longer cost effectively scale at a sufficient rate  or at all 
we believe bics technology  if successful  could enable further memory cost reductions beyond the nand roadmap 
however  even when nand flash memory can no longer scale further  we expect nand flash memory and potential alternative technologies to coexist for an extended period of time 
currently  we are focused on transitioning our products to nanometer and y nanometer technologies and improving manufacturing efficiencies 
through our investments in our ventures with toshiba and our in house assembly and test facility  we have invested heavily in a vertically integrated business model 
we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash memory supply requirements through flash ventures  our significant flash venture relationships with toshiba  which produce and provide us with leading edge  low cost memory wafers 
our manufacturing operations are concentrated in two locations  with flash ventures located in yokkaichi  japan  and our in house assembly and test operations located in shanghai  china 
while we do not unilaterally control the operations of flash ventures  we believe that our vertically integrated business model helps us to reduce the costs of producing our products  increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery to our customers 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid technology transitions and price declines and evolving end user markets for nand flash memory 
historically  removable flash memory cards for imaging devices and usb drives provided the majority of our revenues 
with the emergence of the smartphone and tablet markets  our sales of embedded nand flash memory and cards for mobile phones  tablets  and other mobile devices have increased  and now represent the largest percentage of our product revenues 
over the next several years  we believe that the largest growth areas for nand flash memory will be ssd solutions in the client computing and enterprise data center markets  whereas the mobile market for nand flash memory is expected to grow at a slower rate than in the past  and the retail market for nand flash memory is expected to be approximately constant or declining 
we continue to focus on adapting our business to the changing end markets for nand flash memory and aligning our resources accordingly 
stock repurchase program under our board approved stock repurchase program  we had cumulatively repurchased million shares for million as of december   of which million shares for million were repurchased in fiscal year in addition  in december  our board of directors authorized an additional million for stock repurchases  bringing the total amount authorized for stock repurchases to billion  of which billion remained available for stock repurchases as of december  convertible notes our notes due will mature on may  upon maturity  we will be required to pay million in cash to settle the principal amount outstanding under these notes 
we intend to settle these notes using our current cash resources 
in addition  the associated convertible bond hedge transaction and warrants will either be settled on a net share basis or expire unexercised based upon the closing stock price at maturity or on their respective expiration dates 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  among others  those related to customer programs and incentives  ip claims  product returns  inventories  valuation and impairment of marketable securities and investments  impairments of goodwill and long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructurings  contingencies  share based compensation and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
however  future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  there is transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  pricing is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for customers not eligible for price protection and or a right of return 
sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the distributors or retailers sell the merchandise to their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at december  and january   deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenues and deferred revenues and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements 
sales of standalone software products were not material for any period presented 
we record estimated reductions to revenues or to deferred revenues for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues 
in calculating the value of sales incentive programs  actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customers and historical activity 
the resolution of these claims is generally within twelve months and could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues 
in addition  actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates  which could impact the revenue we report 
inventories and inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally six to twelve months 
the estimated future demand is compared to inventory levels to determine the amount  if any  of obsolete and excess inventory 
the demand forecast includes our estimates of market growth and our market share  various internal estimates and data from certain external sources  and is based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying business and short term manufacturing plans 
to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than the combination of our product on hand and our noncancelable orders from suppliers  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
from time to time  we must evaluate the expected realization of our deferred tax assets and determine whether a valuation allowance needs to be established or released 
in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income  estimates of future income and tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future income include our internal projections and various internal estimates and certain external sources which we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we also consider the jurisdictional mix of income and loss  changes in tax regulations in the period the changes are enacted and the type of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance needs to be established or released  we use judgment in considering the cumulative effect of negative and positive evidence and the weight given to the potential effect of the evidence 
recent historical income or loss and future projected operational results have the most influence on our determinations of whether a deferred tax valuation allowance is required or not 
our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence  complexity of the matter  available federal tax case law  interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates 
there is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we perform tests for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that long lived assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must determine the fair value of the long lived asset or group of long lived assets and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long lived asset or group of long lived assets exceeds its fair value which is based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
these forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
our estimates of market growth and our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets such as in process research and development on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more often if there are indicators of impairment 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and  if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 
as of december   we had one reporting unit 
we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether the two step impairment test on goodwill is required 
if based upon qualitative factors it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  we will not be required to proceed to a two step impairment test on goodwill 
however  we also have the option to proceed directly to a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  or step  of the two step impairment test  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step  or step  of the two step impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization  taking into account an appropriate control premium 
the determination of a control premium requires the use of judgment and is based primarily on comparable industry and deal size transactions  related synergies and other benefits 
when we are required to perform a step analysis  determining the fair value of our net assets and our off balance sheet intangibles used in step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
for both goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired and determine whether further action is needed 
for the fiscal year ended december   we performed a qualitative assessment on indefinite lived intangible assets and performed a quantitative assessment on goodwill 
fair value of investments in debt instruments 
there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note  investments and fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level securities represent quoted prices in active markets  and therefore do not require significant management judgment 
our level securities are primarily valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments and nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data 
we use inputs such as actual trade data  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  and other similar data  which are obtained from independent pricing vendors  quoted market prices  or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities 
the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness  may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information  compared to multiple independent valuation sources and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information 
in the current market environment  the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective 
however  given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets  we do not believe estimates and assumptions materially impacted our valuation of our cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities 
we currently do not have any investments that use level inputs 
results of operations product revenues 
fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages oem retail product revenues the decrease in our fiscal year product revenues  compared to fiscal year  reflected a reduction in average selling price per gigabyte  partially offset by a increase in the number of gigabytes sold 
a primary factor in the decrease in product revenues was a steep rate of price decline in the year ended december  largely due to oversupply in the nand industry in the first half of fiscal year the increase in number of gigabytes sold was driven by an increase in memory units sold with an increase in average capacity of 
the decrease in product revenues in fiscal year  over fiscal year  was due primarily to lower oem sales of cards and embedded products for mobile devices  and lower sales of wafers and components  partially offset by increased sales of client and enterprise ssd products 
our sales of mobile cards were lower due to a reduced rate of card bundling and bundling of lower capacity cards by mobile oem customers  and in the first half of fiscal year  our sales of mobile embedded products were lower as our next generation of those products were in various stages of development and qualification 
our retail product revenue remained relatively flat compared to the prior year 
the increase in our fiscal year product revenues  compared to fiscal year  reflected an increase in the number of gigabytes sold  partially offset by a reduction in average selling price per gigabyte 
the increase in number of gigabytes sold was the result of a increase in memory units sold with an increase in average capacity of

amortization and write off of acquisition related intangible assets 
fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages amortization and write off of acquisition related intangible assets percent of revenue amortization and write off of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was higher due to increased amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions of flashsoft corporation  or flashsoft  and schooner information technology  inc  or schooner  as well as a full year of amortization related to the acquisition of pliant  offset by a reduction in the amortization of intangible assets from a prior acquisition  which became fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal year amortization of acquisition related intangible assets associated with these acquisitions will continue to be amortized through fiscal year amortization and write off of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was higher due to increased amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of pliant  which was completed in may amortization of acquisition related intangible assets associated with the acquisition of pliant will continue to be amortized through the first quarter of fiscal year as part of the pliant purchase agreement  million related to the next generation of enterprise storage products was allocated to acquired in process technology because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
the value was determined by estimating the net cash flows and discounting forecasted net cash flows to their present values 
the net cash flows from the project were based on estimates of revenues  costs of revenues  operating expenses and income taxes 
the estimated net revenues and gross margins were based on our projections of the project and were in line with industry averages 
estimated operating expenses included research and development expenses and selling  marketing and administrative expenses based upon historical and expected direct expense level and general industry metrics 
the project is expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal year  at which point  amortization of the million in process research and development intangible will begin 
as of december   it was estimated that this in process project would be completed at a total remaining cost of approximately million  which includes incremental non recurring engineering costs and customer qualification costs 
the estimate of remaining cost for this in process project has been revised from the original estimate at acquisition date to reflect an increase in the overall cost estimates and development timelines 
the project is dependent on general development and project milestones  which if not met  may result in higher costs  or if not successful  could result in an impairment of the acquired in process technology intangible

provision for income taxes 
fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages provision for income taxes effective income tax rates our fiscal year provision for income taxes differs from the us statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of earnings from foreign operations  state taxes  non deductibility of certain share based compensation and tax exempt interest income 
earnings and taxes resulting from foreign operations are largely attributable to our irish  chinese  israeli and japanese entities 
our fiscal year provision for income taxes differs from the us statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of earnings from foreign operations  state taxes  tax exempt interest income and benefit from federal and california research and development credits 
earnings and taxes resulting from foreign operations are largely attributable to our irish  chinese  israeli and japanese entities 
our fiscal year provision for income taxes was primarily related to income taxes on our us and foreign operations  partially offset by the release of valuation allowances that were previously recorded against our us federal and state deferred tax assets and favorable adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to specific tax jurisdictions 
we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income taxes in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions 
in february  the irs completed its field audit of our federal income tax returns for the years through and issued the revenue agent s report 
the most significant proposed adjustments are comprised of related party transactions between sandisk corporation and its foreign subsidiaries 
we are contesting these adjustments through the irs appeals office and cannot predict when a resolution will be reached 
we strongly believe that the irs s position regarding the intercompany transactions is inconsistent with applicable tax laws  judicial precedent and existing treasury regulations  and that our previously reported income tax provisions for the years in question are appropriate 
we believe that an adequate provision has been made for the adjustments from tax examinations 
however  the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty 
if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner that is not consistent with our expectations  we could be required to adjust our provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs 
the irs recently initiated an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years through we do not expect a resolution of this audit to be reached during the next twelve months 
in addition  we are currently under audit by various state and international tax authorities 
while we believe that we have an adequate provision for the years under audit  there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome from these matters could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the american taxpayer relief act of enacted on january  retroactively extended the federal research and development tax credit and exemption of certain intercompany transactions from federal taxation through december  as a result  we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year and to a lesser extent our effective annual fiscal year tax rate 
the financial statement benefit related to the retroactive federal research and development tax credit is expected to be approximately million 
non gaap financial measures reconciliation of net income 
fiscal years ended december  january  january  in millions except shares and per share amounts net income share based compensation amortization and write off of acquisition related intangible assets convertible debt interest income tax adjustments non gaap net income diluted net income per share share based compensation amortization and write off of acquisition related intangible assets convertible debt interest income tax adjustments non gaap diluted net income per share shares used in computing diluted net income per share in thousands gaap non gaap we believe that providing this additional information is useful in enabling the investor to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods  primarily because management typically monitors the business excluding these items 
we also use these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  and not as a replacement for  data presented in accordance with gaap 
we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures  including non gaap net income and non gaap diluted net income per share  provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to our operating results 
we believe that the use of these non gaap financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports 
we have historically used these non gaap measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives 
we have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past  present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations 
externally  we believe that these non gaap measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of our company 
internally  these non gaap measures are significant measures used by us for purposes of evaluating our core operating performance  establishing internal budgets  setting and determining variable compensation levels  calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives  comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models  strategic planning  and benchmarking performance externally against our competitors 
we exclude the following items from our non gaap measures share based compensation expense 
these expenses consist primarily of expenses for share based compensation  such as stock options  restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan 
although share based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  we exclude share based compensation expenses from our non gaap measures primarily because they are non cash expenses 
further  share based compensation expenses are based on valuations with many underlying assumptions not in our control that vary over time and may include modifications that may not occur on a predictable cycle  neither of which are necessarily indicative of our ongoing business performance 
in addition  the share based compensation expenses recorded are often unrelated to the actual compensation an employee realizes 
we believe that it is useful to exclude share based compensation expense for investors to better understand the long term performance of our core operations and to facilitate comparison of our results to our prior periods and to our peer companies 
amortization and write off of acquisition related intangible assets 
we incur amortization  and  occasionally  write offs of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions 
since we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle  we exclude these items in order to provide investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods 
convertible debt interest 
we incur non cash economic interest expense relating to the implied value of the equity conversion component of the convertible debt 
the value of the equity conversion component is treated as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest rate method 
we also incur interest expense equal to the change in fair value of the liability component of the convertible debt when we repurchase a portion of the convertible debt 
we exclude these non cash interest expenses that do not represent cash interest payments made to our note holders 
income tax adjustments 
this amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after tax basis  considering jurisdictional tax rates  consistent with the presentation of non gaap net income 
from time to time in the future  there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management 
limitations of relying on non gaap financial measures 
we have incurred and will incur in the future  many of the costs that we exclude from the non gaap measures  including share based compensation expense  impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets  amortization and write off of acquisition related intangible assets and other acquisition related costs  non cash economic interest expense associated with our convertible debt and income tax adjustments 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results 
these non gaap measures may be different than the non gaap measures used by other companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
our cash flows were as follows fy percent change fy percent change fy in millions  except percentages net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities is generated by net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  resulted primarily from lower net income 
cash flow from accounts receivable was a lower usage of cash compared with the prior year due to lower sales in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
cash flow from inventory was a lower usage of cash compared to the prior year due to inventory increasing at a slower rate compared to the prior year 
cash flow from other assets increased compared to the prior year primarily due to a prior year prepayment of building related costs for flash forward 
cash flow related to accounts payable to related parties decreased primarily due to the timing of payments to flash ventures as compared to the prior year 
cash flow from other liabilities was a usage of cash compared to an inflow of cash in the prior year primarily due to higher tax payments in fiscal year related to fiscal year higher profitability 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  resulted primarily from higher inventory and other working capital increases 
inventory increased primarily due to the growth in our business and the production ramp at flash forward  which began production in the third quarter of fiscal year cash flow from accounts receivable decreased  as reflected by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal year  compared with the prior year  due to increased revenue in fiscal year cash flow from other assets decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in tax related receivables compared to the prior year and a prepayment of building related costs for flash forward 
accounts payable trade increased primarily due to the timing of payments and an increase in volume as compared to the prior year  resulting in an increase in cash provided 
cash flow from other liabilities in fiscal year decreased  as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of lower accrued payroll and related expenses

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year  as compared to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year  was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of our notes due and related warrants and convertible bond hedge in august  the repurchase of a portion of our notes due in the third quarter of fiscal year and lower cash from employee stock programs in fiscal year liquid assets 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of billion 
we had billion of long term marketable securities  which we believe are also liquid assets  but are classified as long term marketable securities due to the remaining maturity of each marketable security being greater than one year 
short term liquidity 
as of december   our working capital balance was billion 
during fiscal year  we expect our total capital investment to be billion to billion  comprised of our portion of capital investments in flash ventures of approximately million to million and our investment in non fab property and equipment of approximately million 
we expect the capital investments in flash ventures to be funded through flash ventures working capital and equipment leases  and we expect the non fab property and equipment to be funded through our cash 
our current estimate of capital investments for the flash ventures includes productivity and technology transition investments  and does not include any new wafer capacity additions 
we are still evaluating the timing and extent of any new capacity addition in fiscal year at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of our notes due on may   which we expect to settle in cash upon maturity 
depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business 
we may also make equity investments in other companies  engage in merger or acquisition transactions  or purchase or license technologies 
these activities may require us to raise additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts  could prevent us from funding flash ventures  increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies  growing our business  responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  or taking advantage of other future opportunities  any of which could harm our business 
our short term liquidity could be impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding flash ventures master lease agreements 
flash ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor  including  among other things  our failure to maintain a minimum stockholder equity of at least billion and for some of the leases  our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of bb from s p or moody s  or a minimum corporate rating of bb from r i 
as of december   flash ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants 
as of december   our r i credit rating was bbb  two notches above the required minimum corporate rating threshold for r i  and our s p credit rating was bb  one notch above the required minimum corporate rating threshold for s p 
if our stockholders equity falls below billion  or both s p and r i were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold  or other events of default occur  flash ventures would become non compliant with certain covenants under certain master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements 
such resolution could include  among other things  supplementary security to be supplied by us  as guarantor  or increased interest rates or waiver fees  should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances 
if a resolution was unsuccessful  we could be required to pay a portion or up to the entire million outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees under such flash ventures master lease agreements  based upon the exchange rate at december   which would negatively impact our short term liquidity 
as of december   the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was million 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside of the us as of december   no provision had been made for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the us we determined that the calculation of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these cumulative unremitted earnings was not practicable 
if these earnings were distributed to the us  we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes reduced by available foreign tax credits 
in fiscal year  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may acquire up to million of our outstanding common stock over a period of up to five years 
in december  our board of directors authorized an additional million for stock repurchases  bringing the total amount authorized for stock repurchases to billion  of which billion remained available for stock repurchases as of december  as of december   we had cumulatively repurchased million shares for million  of which million shares for million were repurchased in fiscal year under this program  share purchases may be made  from time to time  in both the open market and privately negotiated transactions  and may include the use of derivative contracts  structured stock repurchase agreements and rule b trading plans 
the stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any particular amount of shares 
long term requirements 
depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business 
we may also make equity investments in other companies  engage in merger or acquisition transactions  or purchase or license technologies 
these activities may require us to raise additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts  could prevent us from funding flash ventures  increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies  growing our business  responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business 
financing arrangements 
at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of notes due outstanding and billion aggregate principal amount of notes due outstanding 
see note  financing arrangements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes due  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as of december   the warrants had an expected life of approximately years and expire on different dates from august  through september  at expiration  we may  at our option  elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis 
in addition  concurrent with the issuance of the notes due  we entered into a convertible bond hedge in which counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due in full  at a conversion price of per share 
during fiscal year  concurrent with the repurchase of a portion of the outstanding notes due  we unwound a pro rata portion of the convertible bond hedge and warrants and received net proceeds of million from this unwinding  which was recorded in equity 
we may now purchase up to million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
as of december   none of the remaining warrants had been exercised nor had we purchased any shares under the remaining convertible bond hedge 
the convertible bond hedge will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes due or the first day that none of the notes due remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the notes due concurrent with the issuance of the notes due  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as of december   the warrants had an expected life of approximately years and expire on different dates from november  through january  at each expiration date  we may  at our option  elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis 
as of december   the warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding 
in addition  concurrent with the issuance of the notes due  we entered into a convertible bond hedge transaction in which counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due in full  at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes due or the first day none of the notes due remains outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares  based on the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the notes due  on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the notes due as of december   we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement 
ventures with toshiba 
we are a owner in each entity within flash ventures  our business ventures with toshiba to develop and manufacture nand flash memory products 
these nand flash memory products are manufactured by toshiba at toshiba s yokkaichi  japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by flash ventures 
this equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to flash ventures from us and toshiba as well as through operating leases received by flash ventures from third party banks and guaranteed by us and toshiba 
flash ventures purchases wafers from toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup 
we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flash ventures nand wafer supply or pay for of the fixed costs of flash ventures 
we are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers 
see note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  and note  related parties and strategic investments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
as of december   phase of fab was equipped to a portion of the potential equipment capacity and we had invested in of that equipment 
we expect to achieve incremental wafer capacity through investments in productivity improvements and we have not yet made a decision about adding new wafer capacity 
we are still evaluating the timing and extent of any new capacity addition in fiscal year see note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
the cost of the wafers we purchase from flash ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues 
flash ventures are variable interest entities  however  we are not the primary beneficiary of flash ventures because we do not have a controlling financial interest in each venture 
accordingly  we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate 
for semiconductor manufacturing equipment that is leased by flash ventures  we and toshiba jointly guarantee on an unsecured and several basis  of the outstanding flash ventures lease obligations under original master lease agreements entered into by flash ventures 
these master lease obligations are denominated in japanese yen and are noncancelable 
our total master lease obligation guarantee as of december  was billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at december  in the first quarter of fiscal year  we made a million prepayment for flash forward building related costs 
as of december   million was remaining  of which million was classified as other current assets and million was classified as other non current assets 
from time to time  we and toshiba mutually approve the purchase of equipment for the flash ventures in order to convert to new process technologies or add wafer capacity 
flash partners and flash alliance have already reached full wafer capacity 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december  and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
impact of currency exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash wafers 
in addition  we also have significant costs denominated in the chinese renminbi and the israeli new shekel  and we have revenue denominated in the european euro  the british pound  the japanese yen  the chinese renminbi and the canadian dollar 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
from time to time  we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to partially hedge our future japanese yen costs for nand flash wafers 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income expense or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  or oci  and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized 
these foreign currency exchange exposures may change over time as our business and business practices evolve  and they could harm our financial results and cash flows 
see note  derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
because we purchase the vast majority of our flash memory wafers from flash ventures  our flash memory costs  which represent the largest portion of our cost of product revenues  are based upon wafer purchases denominated in japanese yen 
however  our cost of product revenues in any given quarter generally reflect wafer purchases that were made in the previous quarter  and are impacted by hedging decisions we may make from time to time  including entering into forward contracts or other instruments to hedge our future japanese yen purchase rate 
based on wafer purchases made in the fourth quarter of and forward contracts entered into for early  changes in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate after december are not expected to have a material impact on our cost of product revenues in the first half of fiscal year we expect the average rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar for the wafer purchases portion of our cost of product revenues to be approximately for the first quarter of fiscal and approximately for the second quarter of fiscal see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk for more information about our foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts 
for a discussion of foreign operating risks and foreign currency risks  see item a  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than of the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
the majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar  with some revenues transacted in the european euro  the british pound  the japanese yen  the chinese renminbi and the canadian dollar 
our flash memory costs  which represent the largest portion of our cost of product revenues  are denominated in japanese yen 
we also have some cost of product revenues denominated in the chinese renminbi 
the majority of our operating expenses are denominated in the us dollar  however  we have expenses denominated in japanese yen  the chinese renminbi  the israeli new shekel and numerous other currencies 
on the balance sheet  we have numerous foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  with the largest monetary exposure being our balances with flash ventures  which are denominated in japanese yen 
we enter into foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the gains or losses generated by the remeasurement of our significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the fair value of these contracts is reflected as other assets or other liabilities and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income expense to largely offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  which is also recorded in other income expense 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to partially hedge future japanese yen flash memory costs 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in cost of product revenues in the same period the hedged cost of product revenues is recognized 
at december   we had both foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swap contracts in place that amounted to a net sale in us dollar equivalents of million and million in foreign currencies to hedge our foreign currency denominated monetary net asset position over the next twelve months and on december   respectively 
the notional amount and unrealized gain or loss of our outstanding cross currency swap and foreign currency forward contracts that are non designated balance sheet hedges as of december  are shown in the table below 
in addition  this table shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent 
these changes in fair values would be largely offset in other income expense by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
notional amount unrealized gain loss change in fair value due to adverse rate movement in millions balance sheet hedges cross currency swap contracts sold forward contracts sold forward contracts purchased total net outstanding contracts at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts in place that amounted to a net purchase in us dollar equivalents of approximately million to partially hedge our expected future wafer purchases in japanese yen 
the maturities of these contracts were eight months or less 
the notional amount and fair value of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of december  is shown in the table below 
in addition  this table shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent 
notional amount fair value change in fair value due to adverse rate movement in millions cash flow hedges forward contracts purchased notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks  we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures  and there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
market risk 
with the us long term sovereign credit rating below the highest available rating and the risk of additional future downgrades or related downgrades by recognized credit rating agencies  the investment choices for our cash and marketable securities portfolio could be reduced  which could negatively impact our non operating results 
we do not have direct ownership of european sovereign debt in our investment portfolio 
sales to europe accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal year  and continuing uncertainties in the european financial markets could impact our revenues and financial condition in europe or elsewhere 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
