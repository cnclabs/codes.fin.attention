in this discussion  unless the context suggests otherwise  references to the company  we  us and our mean kite realty group trust and its subsidiaries 
overview in the following overview  we discuss  among other things  the status of our business and properties  the effect that current united states economic conditions is having on our retail tenants and us  and the current state of the financial markets and how it impacts our financing strategy 
our business and properties kite realty group trust  through its majority owned subsidiary  kite realty group  lp  is engaged in the ownership  operation  management  leasing  acquisition  redevelopment  and development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and certain commercial real estate properties in selected markets in the united states 
we derive revenues primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties 
our operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments  conditions in the united states retail sector and overall real estate market conditions 
as of december   we owned interests in a portfolio of operating retail properties totaling million square feet of gross leasable area including non owned anchor space and also owned interests in two operating commercial properties totaling million square feet of net rentable area and an associated parking garage 
also  as of december   we had an interest in six in process development and redevelopment properties  which  upon completion  are anticipated to have million square feet of gross leasable area including non owned anchor space 
in addition to our in process developments and redevelopments  we have future developments  which include land parcels that are undergoing pre development activity and are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financing 
as of december   these future developments consisted of four projects that are expected to contain million square feet of gross leasable area upon completion 
finally  as of december   we also owned interests in other land parcels comprising acres that may be used for future expansion of existing properties  development of new retail or commercial properties or sold to third parties 
these land parcels are classified as land held for development in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
current economic conditions and impact on our retail tenants economic conditions remained uneven for the united states economy  businesses  consumers  housing and credit markets throughout uncertainties about a prolonged economic recovery remain due to continued challenges in the housing market  mixed economic data  and concerns over the us federal government s ability to respond to these challenges 
despite these uncertain conditions  consumer and retailer sentiment continued to improve 
in addition  certain retailers continue to announce plans to increase their store openings over the next months 
however  there is no certainty that these trends will continue and the following factors could impact consumer spending at stores owned and or operated by our retail tenants include  among others united states economy economic and market conditions in the united states stabilized during credit conditions have continued to improve with increased access to and availability of secured mortgage debt and the unsecured bond and equity markets 
manufacturing continued to expand at a steady pace across the nation including increases in shipments and production 
reports of consumer spending were generally positive and the sales outlook for the near future was mostly optimistic 
increasing home values and improving residential construction there was improvement in us home values as residential real estate market conditions improved with increased home sales and increased new residential construction 
continued lower labor participation rates the us unemployment rate has declined in recent months but continues to be higher than historical levels 
continued high unemployment rates and low employee participation rates could cause further decreases in consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the businesses of our retail tenants 
we continue to focus on markets where household income within a five mile radius of our properties is higher than statewide levels 
during  job growth and consumer spending continued to slightly improve from the historically low levels experienced during the recession of  but there is no certainty that this improvement will continue 
in addition  some retailers reported improving same store sales results during the holiday season 
however  it is uncertain whether these improvements will continue  level off  or reverse themselves 
lower consumer spending has a negative impact on the businesses of our retail tenants 
while we did experience strong leasing activity in  to the extent the above described conditions persist or deteriorate further  our tenants may be required to curtail or cease their operations  which could materially and negatively affect our business in general  and our cash flow  in particular 
impact of economy on reits  including us as an owner and developer of community and neighborhood shopping centers  our operating and financial performance is directly affected by economic conditions in the retail sector of those markets in which our operating centers and development properties are located  including the states of indiana  florida and texas  where the majority of our operating properties are located  and in north carolina  where a significant portion of our development projects are located 
as discussed above  due to the challenges facing us consumers  the operations of many of our retail tenants could be negatively affected 
this could in turn have a negative impact on our business based on  but not limited to  the following difficulty in collecting rent  rent adjustments 
when consumers decrease their spending  our tenants typically experience decreased revenues and cash flows 
this makes it more difficult for some of our local and regional tenants to pay their rent obligations  which is the primary source of our revenues 
our tenants decreased cash flows may be even more pronounced if they are unable to obtain financing to operate their businesses 
such decreases or  if granted  deferrals in tenants rent obligations could negatively affect our cash flows 
termination of leases 
if our tenants find it difficult to meet their rental obligations  they may be forced to terminate their leases with us 
during  tenants at some of our properties terminated their leases with us 
in some cases  we were able to secure replacement tenants at rental rates comparable to or greater than the rates of the terminated tenants 
in other cases  we were not able to do so 
tenant bankruptcies 
the number of bankruptcies by us businesses has decreased from the historically high levels experienced during recent years 
while we have seen a decrease over the past year in tenant bankruptcies  we have continued to experience bankruptcy levels higher than our historically normal levels  a trend which may continue into the foreseeable future 
decrease in demand for retail space 
demand for retail space at our shopping centers and at our in process developments continued to improve in  most notably from national and regional retailers 
demand from local  small shop merchants has increased at a slower pace  reflecting the difficulty such potential tenants have securing financing for working capital and expansion plans 
while our leasing activity remained high and the overall leased percentage of our retail shopping centers increased in  overall demand for retail space may not continue and may decline in the future until job growth  consumer confidence  and the general economy stabilize for an extended period of time 
financing strategy  and debt maturities our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms and to refinance borrowings as they mature is affected by the condition of the economy in general and by instability of the financial markets in particular 
the million of our debt maturities consists of property level debt 
we are pursuing financing alternatives to enable us to repay  refinance  or extend the maturity date of these three loans 
based on our favorable experience with refinancing of property level debt and the improvements in the lending environment over the last couple of years  we believe we will be able to satisfactorily address our debt maturities  however  we cannot provide assurances about our ability to do so 
failure to comply with our obligations under these various property level loan agreements could cause an event of default  which  among other things  could result in the loss of title to assets securing such loans  the acceleration of principal and interest payments  termination of the debt facilities  exposure to the risk of foreclosure  or charges to our earnings 
we believe we have good relationships with a number of banks and other financial institutions that will allow us to continue our strategy of refinancing our borrowings with the existing lenders or replacement lenders 
however  it is imperative that we identify alternative sources of financing and other capital in the event we are not able to refinance these loans on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if we are not able to refinance or extend these loans  our financial condition and liquidity could be adversely impacted 
it is also important for us to obtain additional financing in order to complete our in process development and redevelopment projects 
in  we strengthened our balance sheet by entering into a million term loan that is scheduled to mature on april  in addition  we amended our million unsecured revolving credit agreement by  among other things  extending its maturity date to april   which maturity date may be extended for an additional year at our option  subject to certain conditions 
we also entered into million of additional financing and refinancing related activities in as of december   we had a combined million of available liquidity in the form of availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility million and on hand cash and cash equivalents million 
in addition to refinancing our unsecured revolving credit facility  we were also successful in obtaining construction loans to fund the construction costs at our in process developments and redevelopments 
for example in  we entered into construction loans for the following in process developments and redevelopments holly springs towne centre  phase i million  four corner square million  and rangeline crossing million 
obtaining new financing is also important to our business due to the capital needs of our existing development and redevelopment projects 
as of december   the unfunded amount of the total estimated projects costs of our in process development and redevelopment projects was approximately million 
while we believe we will have access to sufficient funding to be able to complete these projects through a combination of new and existing construction loans and uses of our available liquidity which  as noted above  was million as of december   adverse market conditions may make it more costly and difficult to raise additional capital  if necessary 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the compilation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
capitalization of certain pre development and development costs we incur costs prior to vertical construction and for certain land held for development  including acquisition contract deposits as well as legal  engineering  cost of internal resources and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center or other project 
these pre development costs are capitalized and included in construction in progress in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that the completion of a development project is no longer probable  all previously incurred pre development costs are immediately expensed 
we also capitalize costs such as construction  interest  real estate taxes  and the costs of personnel directly involved with the development of our properties 
as a portion of a development property becomes operational  we expense a pro rata amount of related costs 
impairment of investment properties and joint ventures management reviews both operational and development projects  land parcels and intangible assets for impairment on at least a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the review for possible impairment requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates and requires significant judgment 
impairment losses for investment properties and intangible assets are measured when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected holding period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are recorded as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset 
our impairment review for land and development properties assumes we have the intent and the ability to complete the developments or projected uses for the land parcels 
if we determine those plans will not be completed or our assumptions with respect to operating assets are not realized  an impairment loss may be appropriate 
management does not believe any investment properties  development assets  or land parcels were impaired as of december  operating properties held for sale include only those properties available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year  amongst other factors 
operating properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held for sale period 
the company had no investment properties or development assets held for sale as of december  our operating properties have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities 
the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished 
the operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations  and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition 
when material  current and prior period operating results are reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
we also review our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment 
when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity method investment  we evaluate the investment for impairment by estimating our ability to recover our investments from future expected cash flows from the unconsolidated entity 
if we determine the loss in value is other than temporary  we will recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value and the determination of when a loss is other than temporary are complex and subjective 
use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions 
revenue recognition as lessor  we retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases 
base minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on a tenant s sales volume contingent percentage rent 
percentage rent is recognized when tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements 
percentage rent is included in other property related revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expense is incurred 
gains from sales of real estate are not recognized unless a sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property 
as part of our ongoing business strategy  we will  from time to time  sell land parcels and outlots  some of which are ground leased to tenants  on a case by case basis 
development fees and fees from advisory services are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services are rendered 
performance based incentive fees are recorded when the fees are earned 
fair value measurements fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs for identical instruments that are classified within level and observable inputs for similar instruments that are classified within level and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 
as further discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the only assets or liabilities that we record at fair value on a recurring basis are interest rate hedge agreements 
the valuation is determined using widely accepted techniques including discounted cash flow analysis  which considers the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable market based inputs such as interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
we also incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
note includes a discussion of fair values recorded when the company acquired a controlling interest in parkside town commons development project 
level inputs to this transaction include our estimations of the fair value of the real estate and related assets acquired 
note includes a discussion of the fair values recorded in purchase accounting 
level inputs to these acquisitions include our estimations of market leasing rates  tenant related costs  discount rates  and disposal values 
income taxes and reit compliance we are considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes and we have been organized and we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will enable us to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the earnings that we distribute to the extent we distribute our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains to our shareholders and meet certain other requirements on a recurring basis 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed reit taxable income 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we may also be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income even if we do qualify as a reit 
results of operations at december   we owned interests in operating properties consisting of retail properties and two operating commercial properties 
also  as of december   we had an interest in six in process development and redevelopment properties 
at december   we owned interests in operating properties consisting of retail properties and four operating commercial properties 
also  as of december   we had an interest in five in process development and redevelopment properties 
at december   we owned interests in operating properties consisting of retail properties and four operating commercial properties and six entities that held development or redevelopment properties in which we have an interest

the comparability of results of operations is affected by our development  redevelopment  and operating property acquisition and disposition activities in through therefore  we believe it is most useful to review the comparisons of our results of operations for these years as set forth below under comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and and comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and in conjunction with the discussion of our development  redevelopment  and operating property acquisition and disposition activities during those periods  which is set forth directly below

same property net operating income the company believes that net operating income noi is helpful to investors as a measure of its operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of its operating performance  such as depreciation and amortization  interest expense  asset sale gains losses  and impairment  if any 
the company believes that same property noi is helpful to investors as a measure of its operating performance because it includes only the noi of properties that have been owned and operating for the full period presented  which eliminates disparities in net income due to the redevelopment  acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented  and thus provides a more consistent metric for the comparison of the company properties 
noi and same property noi should not  however  be considered as alternatives to net income calculated in accordance with gaap as indicators of the company financial performance

the gross recovery ratio is computed by dividing tenant reimbursements by the sum of recoverable property operating expenses and real estate tax expense 
other property related revenue primarily consists of parking revenues  percentage rent  lease settlement income and gains on land sales 
this revenue decreased million  or  primarily as a result of lower gains on land sales of million due to lower volume of residential land sales at eddy street commons in and no retail outlot sales in as compared to three outlot sales in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in termination fees of million and insurance recovery income of million 
the majority of the termination fee relates to the previous tenant at oleander place 
construction and service fee revenue decreased by million  or primarily as a result of a decline in third party construction contracts and construction management fees due to our strategic decision to reduce third party construction activity 
property operating expenses increased million  or  due to the following net change to development properties that became operational or were partially operational in and or properties acquired during properties under redevelopment during and or properties fully operational during and other total excluding the changes due to transitioned devpment properties  acquired properties  and properties under redevelopment  the net million decrease in property operating expenses for our properties was primarily due to the following million net decrease in bad debt expense at a number of our operating properties reflecting a general recovery in the economic condition of our tenants  million decrease in snow removal costs offset by million increase in repairs and maintenance and million increase in landscaping costs  and the change in other categories of expense were not individually significant 
real estate taxes increased million  or  due to the following net change to development properties that became operational or were partially operational in and or properties acquired during properties under redevelopment during and or properties fully operational during and other total excluding the changes due to transitioned development properties  acquired properties  and properties under redevelopment  the net million increase in real estate tax expense for our properties was primarily due to increased assessments of the taxable value at a number of our operating properties 
the majority of the increases and decreases in our real estate tax expense from increased assessments and subsequent appeals is recoverable from or reimbursable to tenants and  therefore  reflected in tenant reimbursement revenue 
cost of construction and services decreased million  or primarily as a result of a decline in third party construction contracts and construction management fees due to our strategic decision to reduce third party construction activity 
general  administrative and other expenses increased million  or due to an increase in personnel related expenses along with an increase in other public company related costs 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  due to the following net change to development properties that became operational or were partially operational in and or properties acquired during properties under redevelopment during and or properties fully operational during and other total accelerated depreciation and amortization of million was recorded in due to the commencement of redevelopment at rivers edge 
redevelopment plans for this property were finalized during the second quarter of  resulting in a reduction in the useful lives of certain assets that were scheduled to be demolished 
these decreases in depreciation and amortization were partially offset by an increase of million related to acquired properties  transition of development properties to the operating portfolio  and timing of lease commencement at operating properties 
included in the million is million of accelerated depreciation on the redevelopment of oleander place that commenced in the second quarter of interest expense decreased million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to reduction of indebtedness from the proceeds of our december preferred stock issuance 
this decrease was partially offset by a higher rate on the company s line of credit and increased amortization of deferred financing fees related to current year borrowings and the company s objective of terming out debt on recently completed projects 
income tax benefit expense of our taxable reit subsidiary changed from an expense of  in to a benefit of  in the expense was due to income of our taxable reit subsidiary related to the sale of residential assets at eddy street commons in the slight benefit in was due to lower residential assets at eddy street commons along with minimal construction volume 
income loss from unconsolidated entities changed from a loss of  in to income of  in the loss of  in included our share of pre operating expenses related to the limited service hotel at our eddy street commons property  which opened in june the income in related to ten months of operations at the limited service hotel as the hotel s occupancy improved 
the hotel was sold in november the million gain on sale of unconsolidated property  including tax benefit represents our share of the gain on the sale of the limited service hotel at eddy street commons property 
the company had income related to discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  compared to income of million for the year ended december  the company did not sell any properties in compared to one property in in addition  the properties sold in includes coral springs plaza and south elgin commons that were placed into the operating portfolio in upon completion of development redevelopment activity 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests changed from a loss of million in to income of  in net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests generally reflects the net income attributable to the operating partnership  less dividends on preferred shares  that is owned by the limited partners and interests in consolidated properties owned by others 
the change is the result of higher earnings of the operating partnership 
dividends on preferred shares increased million 
the increase was due to the company completing an offering of  shares of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares in december liquidity and capital resources current state of capital markets and our financing strategy our primary financing and capital strategy is to continue to strengthen our balance sheet while maintaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities 
we consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings or equity offerings  including the purchase price of properties to be developed or acquired  the estimated market value of our properties and the company as a whole upon placement of the borrowing or offering  and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover debt service 
in october  we issued  common shares for net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds initially were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the company s unsecured revolving credit facility  and subsequently were redeployed to acquire shoppes at plaza green  publix at woodruff  shoppes at eastwood acquired in and to fund redevelopment activities 
also  in march  we issued  shares of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares for net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds were initially used to reduce the outstanding balance on the company s unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition to raising new equity capital  we have also been successful in obtaining construction loans to fund the development costs of our in process development and redevelopment projects 
we entered into construction loans to fund the development of holly springs towne center phase i  four corner square  and rangeline crossing 
in addition  we entered into a new million seven year term loan and utilized the proceeds to retire loans secured by our rivers edge  cobblestone plaza  estero town commons  tarpon bay plaza  and fox lake crossing properties 
we were also able to effectively recycle capital by selling outlots  unoccupied land parcels  and non core operating properties 
during  we generated gross proceeds of million from such sales inclusive of our partners share  the majority of which was used to pay down outstanding indebtedness 
the proceeds after retiring secured loans on the sold properties were redeployed into acquisitions  in process development and redevelopment projects  and tenant improvement costs 
in the future  we may raise additional capital by pursuing joint venture capital partnerships and or disposing of additional properties  land parcels or other assets that are no longer core components of our growth strategy 
we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million 
we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk with regards to our cash and cash equivalents 
we place our cash and short term cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions 
from time to time  such investments may temporarily be held in accounts in excess of fdic and sipc insurance limits  however  we attempt to limit our exposure at any one time 
we also maintain certain compensating balances in several financial institutions in support of borrowings from those institutions 
such compensating balances were not material to the consolidated balance sheets 
our principal capital resources our unsecured revolving credit facility the operating partnership is a party to an amended and restated million unsecured revolving credit facility the unsecured facility along with a group of financial institutions led by key bank national association  as administrative agent  and the other lenders party thereto 
the company and several of the operating partnership s subsidiaries are guarantors of the operating partnership s obligations under the unsecured facility 
the unsecured facility has a maturity date of april   which maturity date may be extended for an additional year at the operating partnership s option subject to certain conditions 
borrowings under the unsecured facility bear interest at a floating interest rate of libor to basis points  depending on the company s leverage 
the unsecured facility has a commitment fee of to basis points on unused borrowings 
subject to certain conditions  including the prior consent of the lenders  the company has the option to increase its borrowings under the unsecured facility to a maximum of million if there are sufficient unencumbered assets to support the additional borrowings 
the unsecured facility also includes a short term borrowing line of million with a variable interest rate 
borrowings under the short term line may not be outstanding for more than five days 
the amount that the company may borrow under the unsecured facility is based on the value of assets in its unencumbered property pool 
as of december   the company had unencumbered properties and other assets used to calculate the value of the unencumbered property pool  of which were wholly owned and are guarantors under the unsecured credit facility and term loan and three of which were owned through joint ventures 
the major unencumbered assets include broadstone station  cobblestone plaza  the corner  courthouse shadows  cove center  estero town commons  fox lake crossing  glendale town center  king lake square  lithia crossing  market street village  oleander place  plaza at cedar hill  shoppes at plaza green  publix at woodruff  rivers edge  red bank commons  shops at eagle creek  tarpon bay plaza  traders point ii  union station parking garage  gainesville plaza  and waterford lakes village 
as of december   the total maximum amount available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility was million  with million available for future draws 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured facility was million  bearing interest at a rate of libor basis points 
in addition  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of december  the company s ability to borrow under the unsecured facility is subject to ongoing compliance with various restrictive covenants  including with respect to liens  indebtedness  investments  dividends  mergers and asset sales 
in addition  the unsecured facility requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants  including among others a maximum leverage ratio of 
the leverage ratio can be above but less than for a maximum of two consecutive quarters  adjusted ebitda as defined in the unsecured facility to fixed charges coverage ratio excluding a portion of preferred dividends of at least to  minimum tangible net worth defined as total asset value less total indebtedness of million plus of the net proceeds of any future equity issuances from the date of the agreement  ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value of no more than 
to  minimum unencumbered property pool occupancy rate of  ratio of floating rate debt to total asset value of no more than to  and ratio of recourse debt to total asset value of no more than to the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the unsecured facility as of december  under the terms of the unsecured facility  the company is permitted to make distributions to its shareholders of up to of its funds from operations provided that no event of default exists 
if an event of default exists  the company may only make distributions sufficient to maintain its reit status 
however  the company may not make any distributions if an event of default resulting from nonpayment or bankruptcy exists  or if its obligations under the credit facility are accelerated 
capital markets we have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission allowing us to offer  from time to time  common shares or preferred shares for an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million 
in october  we issued  common shares for net proceeds of million 
in march  we issued  shares of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares for net proceeds of million 
in december  we issued  shares of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares for net proceeds of million 
we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
sale of real estate assets we may pursue opportunities to sell non strategic real estate assets in order to generate additional liquidity 
our ability to dispose of such properties is dependent on the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable 
sales prices on such transactions may be less than our carrying value 
in  we were also able to effectively recycle capital by selling the following non core operating properties 
gateway shopping center near seattle  washington  south elgin commons near chicago  illinois  coral springs plaza in fort lauderdale  florida  south morton near indianapolis  indiana  pen products in indianapolis  indiana  indiana state motor pool in indianapolis  indiana  preston commons and an adjacent land parcel in dallas  texas  zionsville shops near indianapolis  indiana  and sandifur plaza in pasco  washington 
during  we generated proceeds of million from such sales inclusive of our partners share  of which million was used to pay down loans secured by the properties 
the remaining proceeds were redeployed into acquisition  development activity  redevelopment activity  and tenant improvement costs 
short and long term liquidity needs overview we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
while we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically invest primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a relatively stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  the recent economic downturn adversely affected the ability of some of our tenants to meet their lease obligations  as discussed in more detail above in overview on page short term liquidity needs the nature of our business  coupled with the requirements to qualify for reit status including  for example  the requirement that we distribute at least of our reit taxable income on an annual basis may cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term 
our short term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt  expected dividend payments including distributions to persons who hold units in our operating partnership and recurring capital expenditures 
our board of trustees the board declared quarterly cash distribution of per common share and common operating partnership unit for each quarter of our board also declared a quarterly cash distribution of 
per series a preferred share per quarter in each quarter we discuss with our board our liquidity requirements along with other relevant factors before the board decides whether and in what amount to declare a cash distribution 
when we lease space to new tenants  or renew leases for existing tenants  we also incur expenditures for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
this amount  as well as the amount of recurring capital expenditures that we incur  will vary from year to year 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on operating properties and also incurred million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions excluding first generation space and development and redevelopment properties 
we currently anticipate incurring approximately million in recurring capital expenditures at our operating properties and approximately million to million of additional major tenant improvements and renovation costs within the next twelve months at several operating properties 
we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund our investment in these projects through borrowings on our unsecured credit facility 
in certain circumstances  we may seek to place specific construction financing on the in process redevelopment projects 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through borrowings under the unsecured facility  new construction loans  cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  accessing the public equity and debt markets to the extent that we are able to do so 
in process development and redevelopment properties 
as of december   we had six in process development or redevelopment projects 
the total estimated cost  including our share and our joint venture partners share  for these projects is approximately million  of which million had been incurred as of december  we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through existing or new construction loans 
debt maturities as of december   million of our outstanding indebtedness was scheduled to mature in  excluding scheduled monthly principal payments 
we are pursuing financing alternatives to enable us to repay  refinance  or extend the maturity date of these loans 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the development of new properties  redevelopment of existing properties  non recurring capital expenditures  tenant improvement costs  acquisitions of properties  and payment of indebtedness at maturity 
future redevelopment property 
as of december   courthouse shadows was undergoing preparation for redevelopment including leasing activity 
we currently anticipate our total investment in this redevelopment project will be approximately million  of which million has been incurred as of december   however  this amount may increase as redevelopment plans are finalized 
we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund our investment in this project through borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in certain circumstances  we may seek to place specific construction financing on this redevelopment project 
future development pipeline 
in addition to our in process developments  we have a future development pipeline which includes land parcels that are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financing 
as of december   this future development pipeline consisted of three projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet of total leasable area 
we currently anticipate the total estimated cost of these projects will be approximately million  of which million has been incurred as of december  with respect to each future development project  our policy is to not commence vertical construction until pre established leasing thresholds are achieved and the requisite third party financing is in place 
we intend to fund our investment in these developments primarily through new construction loans  as well as borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility  if necessary 
selective acquisitions  developments and joint ventures 
we may selectively pursue the acquisition and development of other properties  which would require additional capital 
it is unlikely we would have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long term capital requirements 
we would have to satisfy these needs through additional borrowings  sales of common or preferred shares  cash generated through property dispositions and or participation in potential joint venture arrangements 
we cannot be certain that we would have access to these sources of capital on satisfactory terms  if at all  to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
we evaluate all future opportunities against pre established criteria including  but not limited to  location  demographics  tenant relationships  and amount of existing retail space 
our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors  including general capital market conditions  which is discussed in more detail above in overview on page capitalized expenditures on consolidated properties the following table summarizes cash basis capital expenditures for the company s in process and future development properties and capital expenditures for the year ended december  and on a cumulative basis since the project s inception year ended december  cumulative through december  in process developments future developments and redevelopments in process redevelopments total for development activity recently completed developments  net n a recurring operating capital expenditures n a total cumulative capital expenditures excludes million of leasing costs included in deferred costs  net on the consolidated balance sheet 
this classification includes rivers edge  cobblestone plaza  depauw university bookstore caf  oleander plaza  and zionsville walgreens 
the company capitalizes certain indirect costs such as interest  payroll  and other general and administrative costs related to these development activities 
if the company were to experience a reduction in development activities  without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs  the company would have recorded additional expense for the year ended december  of million 
cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the decrease was due to higher cash outflows for accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities of million 
the decrease was also due to distributions from unconsolidated entities of million in as a result of the sale of the eddy street limited service hotel asset compared to distributions of  in cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of an increase in net proceeds from sale of operating properties of million as multiple properties were sold in compared to the sale of one property in in addition  the amount of construction payables increased million due to the timing of construction activity at our in process development properties 
these decreases were offset by an increase in cash outflows for acquisitions of million and capital expenditures  net of million 
in addition  the company contributed million to our parkside town commons development property in  while  in  the company contributed  to parkside town commons 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  an increase of million from highlights of significant cash sources and uses in are as follows in march  we issued million shares of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares for net proceeds of million 
a repayment of million was made on the unsecured revolving credit facility from the net proceeds of the offering  in october  we issued million common shares for net proceeds of million  net debt paydowns of million  distributions of million to our partners in consolidated joint ventures 
the majority of this relates to our partner s share of net proceeds from the sale of gateway shopping center  distributions to common shareholders and operating partnership unitholders of million  and distributions to preferred shareholders of million 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to improved operating results partially offset by higher cash out flows for deferred leasing costs and escrow deposits in in addition  we received distributions from unconsolidated entities of million in as a result of the sale of the eddy street limited service hotel asset 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  an increase of million from the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of an increase in capital expenditures  net from million in to million in along with cash out flows for the acquisitions of oleander place and lithia crossing of million 
in addition  the company contributed million to our parkside town commons development property in  while  in  we contributed  to our eddy street commons limited service hotel property 
these increases were offset by net proceeds from the sale of our martinsville shops operating property of million 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  an increase of million from in  we had a net increase in debt of million that was utilized to fund current year development and acquisition activity 
this increase was offset by current year distributions to common shareholders  preferred shareholders  and entities that hold noncontrolling interests 
in addition  we paid million to acquire our partners interests in rangeline crossing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do  however  have certain obligations to some of the projects in our in process development pipeline  as discussed below in contractual obligations 
as of december   we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million and no amounts were advanced against these instruments 
contracual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties based on contracts executed as of december  tenant allowances operating leases consolidated long term debt and interest employment contracts total thereafter total tenant allowances include commitments made to tenants at our operating and in process development and redevelopment properties 
our long term debt consists of both variable and fixed rate debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rates as of december  we have entered into employment agreements with certain members of senior management 
under these agreements  each individual received a stipulated annual base salary through december  each agreement has an automatic one year renewal unless we or the individual elects not to renew the agreement 
the contracts have been extended through december  in connection with the construction of the eddy street commons parking garage and certain infrastructure improvements  we are obligated to fund payments under tax increment financing tif bonds issued by the city of south bend  indiana 
the majority of the bonds will be funded by real estate tax payments made by us and subject to reimbursement from the tenants of the property 
if there are delays in the development  we are obligated to pay certain delay fees 
however  we have an agreement with the city of south bend to limit our exposure to a maximum of million as to such fees 
in addition  we will not be in default concerning other obligations under the agreement with the city of south bend so long as we commence and diligently pursue the completion of our obligations under that agreement 
in connection with our formation at the time of our ipo  we entered into an agreement that restricts our ability  prior to december   to dispose of six of our properties in taxable transactions and limits the amount of gain we can trigger with respect to certain other properties without incurring reimbursement obligations owed to certain limited partners 
we have agreed that if we dispose of any interest in six specified properties in a taxable transaction before december   then we will indemnify the contributors of those properties for their tax liabilities attributable to their built in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our ipo and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment 
the six properties to which our tax indemnity obligations relate represented of our annualized base rent in the aggregate as of december  these six properties are international speedway square  shops at eagle creek  whitehall pike  ridge plaza  thirty south  and market street village 
obligations in connection with our in process developments and redevelopments we are obligated under various completion guarantees with lenders and lease agreements with tenants to complete all or portions of our in process development and redevelopment projects 
we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through existing or new construction loans 
in addition  if necessary  we may make draws on our unsecured facility 
our share of estimated future costs for our in process and future developments and redevelopments is further discussed on page in the short and long term liquidity needs section

as of december   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company was in payment default on a million non recourse loan due to insufficient cash flow from the related operating property to fully support the debt service on the loan 
under the terms of the loan agreement  interest accrues at the stated rate of plus a default rate and the principal balance of the loan may be called at any time at the election of the lender 
the lender has not indicated an intent to exercise its right to call the loan  but it has also not provided formal waiver thereof to the company 
the default on this loan did not trigger any cross defaults on its other indebtedness or any of its derivative instruments 
in the contractual obligations table on page  the company has included this obligation payments through the stated maturity date of january  funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which we refer to as the white paper 
the white paper defines ffo as consolidated net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales and impairments of depreciated property  less preferred dividends  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for third party shares of appropriate items 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in consolidated net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales and impairment of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult 
for informational purposes  we have also provided ffo adjusted for accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and a litigation charge  net 
we believe this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance 
we believe that our presentation of adjusted ffo provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and compared to our peers 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated net income loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computations of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits 
our calculation of ffo and ffo  as adjusted  and reconciliation to consolidated net loss income is as follows funds from operations year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  consolidated net loss income less dividends on preferred shares less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in properties less gain loss on sale of operating property  net of tax expense less gain on sale of unconsolidated property  including tax benefit add remeasurement loss on consoldiation of parkside town commons  net add depreciation and amortization net of noncontrolling interests funds from operations of the kite portfolio less redeemable noncontrolling interests in funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company funds from operations of the kite portfolio add back accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees add back litigation charge  net funds from operations of the kite portfolio  as adjusted funds from operations of the kite portfolio measures of the operating performance of the operating partnership s real estate properties and construction and service subsidiaries in which the company owns an interest

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevailing interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates of debt instruments of similar maturities and terms 
market risk related to fixed and variable rate debt we had million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of december  inclusive of net premiums on acquired debt of million 
as of december   we were party to various consolidated interest rate hedge agreements for a total of million  with maturities over various terms ranging from through including the effects of these hedge agreements  our fixed and variable rate debt would have been million and million  respectively  of our total consolidated indebtedness at december  our future earnings  cash flows and fair values related to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  primarily libor 
libor was at historically low levels during based on the amount of our fixed rate debt at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 
a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  would decrease our annual cash flow by approximately million 
based upon the terms of our variable rate debt  we are most vulnerable to change in short term libor interest rates 
the sensitivity analysis was estimated using cash flows discounted at current borrowing rates adjusted by basis points 
as a matter of policy  we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative transactions 
inflation most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance to the extent we are able to recover such costs from our tenants 
however  increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses  as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents 
also  inflation may adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases or limits on such tenant s obligation to pay its share of operating expenses  which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time  and limit our ability to recover all of our operating expenses
