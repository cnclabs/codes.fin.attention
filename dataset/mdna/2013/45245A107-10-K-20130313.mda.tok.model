overview following is a summary of significant items impacting the company during the year that impacted our operating results  liquidity and capital structure in strategic transformation during the fourth quarter of  we announced the acceleration of our strategic transformation  including the planned realignment of our global business into two new business units  a cost reduction program and our increased focus on data storage and security including exploring strategic options for our consumer electronics brands and businesses 
as our traditional media businesses decline  we are accelerating our business transformation to further focus on data storage and data security 
further  on february   we announced our plans to divest our xtrememac and memorex consumer electronics businesses 
we will continue our tdk life on record business on a more selective basis 
the realignment of our global business into two new business units will better align the company with our key commercial and consumer channels 
the two business units will consist of tiered storage and security solutions tss  which will focus on small and medium business and enterprise and government customers  and consumer storage and accessories csa  which will focus on retail channels 
we continued to manage and evaluate results through december  under our historic regional segment presentation but will report segment information under the new structure beginning with the first quarter of see note business segment information and geographical data in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our business segments 
in october  the board of directors approved a restructuring program in order to realign our business structure and reduce operating expenses by more than percent over time 
this restructuring program addresses product line rationalization and infrastructure  and includes a reduction of approximately percent of our global workforce 
these actions are being implemented beginning in we anticipate we will incur cash charges up to million  with total charges between million and million excluding charges associated with goodwill and intangible asset impairments  the majority of which will occur in see note restructuring and other expense in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the restructuring program 
in conjunction with the acceleration of our strategic transformation in the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our intangible assets  including goodwill  for impairment and recorded non cash impairment charges of million in the quarter 
the intangible asset charges are primarily due to an accelerated secular optical market decline 
see note intangible assets and goodwill in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the impairment charges 
product overview optical media product revenue comprised percent  percent and percent of our total 
table of contents consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
the optical media market continues to contract and such contractions accelerated in as consumers continued to adopt alternatives such as digital streaming  hard disk and flash media  resulting in decreasing revenues 
we believe we are generally maintaining our worldwide market share 
during and we saw significant price increases for the raw materials required to produce optical media  particularly polycarbonate which is made out of oil and silver 
these raw materials price increases were passed on to us in by our suppliers and although they were subsequently mitigated in part by successfully negotiated price increases with our customers  they resulted in gross margin pressures 
the contracting optical media market size and increasing raw materials prices impacted all of our segments resulting in decreasing revenues and gross margins 
during  we reversed million of accruals related to prior year european optical media copyright levies payable for which we considered payment remote due to the european court of justice ecj ruling on the european copyright directive  which became effective in see note litigation  commitments and contingencies in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding levies 
magnetic product revenue comprised percent  percent and percent of our total consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
while we expect the demand for data storage capacity to increase  advances in technology allow increasingly more data to be stored on a single unit of magnetic tape and thus  over the recent past  the market has declined each year 
while the market is getting smaller  we believe we are maintaining our market share in all of our regional business segments 
we discontinued tape coating operations at our weatherford  oklahoma facility in in order to gain efficiencies and reduce manufacturing costs 
we signed a strategic agreement with tdk corporation to jointly develop and manufacture magnetic tape technologies 
under the agreement  we are collaborating on the research and development of future tape formats in both companies research centers in the united states and japan and we consolidated tape coating operations to the tdk yamanashi manufacturing facility 
the contracting magnetic tape market size impacted all of our segments resulting in decreasing revenues  and we expect these trends to continue into other traditional storage product revenue comprised percent  percent and percent of our total consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
we expect the demand for audio video tape and optical drives  the products which comprise the majority of the revenue in this category  to decrease over time 
secure and scalable storage product revenue comprised percent  percent and percent of our total consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
the increase as a percent of total revenue for this component reflects our investment in secure and scalable storage products through our acquisitions in we continued our strategy of investing in growth platforms in data storage and security solutions with the acquisition of nexsan corporation nexsan on december  the acquisition of nexsan brings us a proven technology platform and a robust portfolio of disk based and hybrid disk and solid state storage systems and is expected to significantly accelerate our growth in the small and medium sized business and distributed enterprise storage markets 
imation will provide the nexsan business with global scale and a well known storage brand for global expansion 
we expect growth in these secure and scalable products as a result of the businesses we acquired in and audio and video information product revenue comprised percent  percent and percent of our total consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
declines in these products were driven by decreased revenue in the united states as we continued to experience a very difficult retail environment for the products we sell 
as a part of the acceleration of our strategic transformation and our increased focus on data storage and security  on february   we announced our plans to divest our xtrememac and memorex consumer electronics businesses  which represent a significant portion of this product group 
we will continue our tdk life on record business on a more focused basis

table of contents we test the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each year or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would warrant impairment testing during an interim period 
during  we acquired the assets of mxi security  from memory experts international inc  mxi and the secure data storage hardware business of ironkey systems inc ironkey which resulted in goodwill of million and million  respectively 
these businesses  along with our imation defender brand  make up our americas mobile security reporting unit 
the carrying value of our mobile security reporting unit included million of goodwill prior to our impairment testing 
during the second and third quarters of  we adjusted our internal financial forecast for our americas mobile security reporting unit due to changes in timing of expected cash flows and lower expected short term revenues and lower gross margins 
as we considered these factors to be an event that warranted an interim test as to whether the goodwill was impaired  we performed an impairment test as of each of these periods 
these impairment tests resulted in no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value in step of the impairment tests by percent and percent  during the second and third quarter of  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  our internal financial forecast for our americas mobile security reporting unit was again adjusted with further declines in our revenue and gross margin projections resulting from lower expectations in the high security market segment 
in accordance with our policy  we performed our annual assessment of goodwill in the americas mobile security reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and  as a result of this assessment  it was determined that the fair value of our mobile security reporting unit was impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million to the americas reporting segment in the consolidated statements of operations 
in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  we used the income approach  a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit financial forecasts 
our expected cash flows are affected by various significant assumptions  including the discount rate  revenue and gross margin expectations and terminal value growth rate 
our analysis utilized discounted forecasted cash flows over a year period with an estimation of residual growth rates thereafter 
we use our business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
the significant assumptions used include a discount rate of percent to reflect the relevant risks of the higher growth assumed for the americas mobile security reporting unit  revenue growth rates  which were forecasted to be significant  and a terminal growth rate of percent 
an increase in the discount rate of one percent would have decreased the reporting unit fair value by approximately percent while a decrease in the discount rate by one percent would have increased the reporting unit fair value by percent 
the revenue growth rates in through are significant assumptions within the projections 
during  we acquired substantially all of the assets of becompliant corporation  doing business as encryptx encryptx which resulted in goodwill of million 
the goodwill was allocated to our existing americas commercial reporting unit 
based on an interim goodwill impairment test performed at march   we determined that the goodwill in the americas commercial reporting unit  including the assets of encryptx  exceeded the implied fair value and  therefore  the goodwill was fully impaired 
as a result  a million charge was recorded in in restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations 
during  we made certain changes to our business segments 
as a result of the segment change in  the million of goodwill which was previously allocated to the electronics products segment was merged into the americas consumer reporting unit 
the americas consumer reporting unit had a fair value that was significantly less than its carrying amount prior to the combination  which is a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test 
a two step impairment test was performed to identify a potential impairment and measure an impairment loss to be recognized 
based on the goodwill test performed in the second quarter of  we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its fair value and that the million of goodwill was fully impaired 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note intangible assets and goodwill in our notes to consolidated financial statements as well as critical accounting policies and estimates for further background and information on goodwill impairments 
intangible impairments during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the results of our revised internal financial forecast  which was finalized during the quarter and took into account the expected actions and outcomes associated with the 
table of contents acceleration of our strategic transformation as further described in above  qualified as a triggering event for impairment testing 
this required the assessment of the recoverability of the long lived assets including definite lived intangible assets included in all of our asset groups with the exception of the recent acquisition of nexsan 
as a result of this event  we compared the carrying value of our asset groups with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows and determined that the carrying value of certain intangible asset groups exceeded their fair value 
we generally determined our asset groups to be associated with our various brands as that is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of one another 
we then calculated the impairment of these asset groups as the excess of their carrying value over their discounted fair value and as a result we recorded an impairment loss of million which was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
in calculating the discounted fair value of the asset groups  we used the income approach  a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using our financial forecasts associated with the asset groups 
our expected cash flows are affected by various significant assumptions  including projected sales  gross margin and expense expectations as well as a discount rate 
our analysis utilized forecasted cash flows ranging from a four year to a year period depending on the asset group  and our business plans served as the basis for these cash flow assumptions 
the analysis utilized discount rates ranging from percent to percent depending on the asset group 
an increase in the discount rate of one percent would have decreased the intangible asset fair value by approximately percent while a decrease in the discount rate by one percent would have increased the intangible asset fair value by percent 
litigation settlements a litigation settlement charge of million was recognized in we entered into a settlement with advanced research corp 
arc under which we agreed to pay arc million to settle a dispute relating to a supply agreement under which we purchased magnetic heads to write servo patterns on magnetic tape 
a litigation settlement charge of million was recognized in on january   we signed a patent cross license agreement with sandisk corporation sandisk to settle two patent cases filed by sandisk in federal district court against our flash memory products  including usb drives and solid state disk drives 
under the terms of the cross license  we will pay sandisk royalties on certain flash memory products that were previously not licensed 
the specific terms of the cross license are confidential 
the cross license agreement required us to make a one time payment of million in  which was included in litigation settlement expense in the consolidated statements of operations during see note litigation  commitments and contingencies in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

the amendment modified the credit agreement by extending the expiration date of the borrowing arrangement to may   requiring that the equity interests of material foreign subsidiaries be pledged to support the obligations  if any  of the european borrower  lowered the applicable margin on interest  lowered the company minimum required consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the amended credit agreement to be maintained as well as provided for certain other less significant changes 
the amended credit agreement includes a senior revolving credit facility that allows for the borrowing of amounts up to a maximum of million  including sublimits of million in the united states and million in europe 
borrowings in both the united states and europe are limited to the lesser of the sublimit s and the borrowing base as defined in the amended credit agreement and are payable upon expiration of the amended credit agreement or immediately  but only to the extent the applicable sublimit s are reduced to an amount less than the amount borrowed at that time 
our borrowing base is calculated each quarter unless our outstanding loan amount is greater than million in which our borrowing base is calculated monthly 
our borrowing base is based on our amounts of receivables  inventories and other factors that influence the borrowing base and  to the extent any outstanding borrowing exceed the borrowing base  any such excess is due and payable immediately 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under this arrangement was million in the united states and million in europe 
prior to august   borrowings bore interest at an interest rate equal to the eurodollar rate as defined in the amended credit agreement plus percent or the base rate as defined in the amended credit agreement plus percent

our european obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the material personal property of the european borrower 
borrowings under the european portion of the credit facility are limited to the lesser of a million and b the european borrowing base 
the european borrowing base calculation is fundamentally the same as the us borrowing base  subject to certain differences to account for european law and other similar issues

this amount includes million of reserves for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties 
the table above does not include payments for non contributory defined benefit pension plans 
it is our general practice  at a minimum  to fund amounts sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in applicable benefits laws and local tax laws 
from time to time  we contribute additional amounts  as we deem appropriate 
we expect to contribute approximately million to million to our pension plans in and have million recorded in other liabilities related to pension plans as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to the extent necessary 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered in the future 
a valuation 
table of contents allowance is recorded to the extent we conclude a deferred tax asset is not considered to be more likely than not to be realized 
we consider all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized significant restructuring charges related to our us operations 
due to these charges and cumulative losses incurred in recent years  we were no longer able to conclude that it was more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets would be fully realized 
therefore  during  we recorded a charge to establish a valuation allowance of million related to our us deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance charge in is included in income tax provision on our consolidated statement of operations 
in and we have concluded that it is necessary to maintain a valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
the accounting estimate for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
a valuation allowance established or revised as a result of our assessment is recorded through income tax provision benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events  or other factors  could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   our net deferred tax asset  net of valuation allowances of million  was million 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to our us deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized in the future 
our income tax returns are subject to review by various us and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  we record accruals for items that we believe may be challenged by these taxing authorities 
the threshold for recognizing the benefit of a tax return position in the financial statements is that the position must be more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties described below 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefit of deductible interest 
the reversal of accrued interest and penalties would affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
our us federal income tax returns for and are subject to examination by the internal revenue service 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax jurisdictions  or state and city tax jurisdictions for years before in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdiction 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly during the next twelve months due to the resolution of certain us and international tax uncertainties  however it is not possible to estimate the potential change at this time 
litigation 
we record a liability when a loss from litigation is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  we believe that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is our opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to us beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to our financial position 
as additional information becomes available  the potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 

table of contents intangibles 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including intangibles  at estimated fair value 
intangible assets with a definite life are amortized based on a pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed  typically with useful lives ranging from one to years 
the initial recognition of intangible assets  the determination of useful lives and  if necessary  subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using certain valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
we evaluate assets on our balance sheet  including such intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors such as unfavorable variances from forecasted cash flows  established business plans or volatility inherent to external markets and industries may indicate a possible impairment that would require an impairment test 
while we believe that the current carrying value of these assets is not impaired  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses  which in many cases require subjective judgments concerning estimates  could result in significant impairment losses 
the test for impairment requires a comparison of the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
in conjunction with the acceleration of our strategic transformation in the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our intangible assets for impairment and recorded non cash impairment charges of million in the quarter 
the intangible asset charges are primarily due to an accelerated secular optical market decline 
see intangible impairments for further discussion of the impairment test performed 
after this impairment loss  and our acquisition of nexsan  as of december   we had had million of definite lived intangible assets subject to amortization 
while we believe that the current carrying value of these assets is not impaired  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 
goodwill 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  at fair value 
the initial recognition of goodwill and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized 
we test the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each year or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would warrant impairment testing during an interim period 
goodwill is considered impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned to its carrying amount 
the second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
this involves measuring the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities both recognized and unrecognized at the time of the impairment test 
the difference between the reporting unit s fair value and the fair values assigned to the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
our reporting units for goodwill are our operating segments americas  europe  north asia and south asia with the exception of the americas segment which is further divided between the americas consumer  americas commercial and mobile security reporting units as determined by sales channel 
during  we acquired the assets of mxi security  from memory experts international inc  mxi and the secure data storage hardware business of ironkey systems inc ironkey which resulted in goodwill of million and million  respectively 
these businesses  along with our imation defender brand  make up our americas mobile security reporting unit 
the carrying value of our mobile security reporting unit included million of goodwill prior to our impairment testing 
during the second and third quarters of  we adjusted our internal financial forecast for our americas mobile security reporting unit due to changes in timing of expected cash flows and lower expected short term revenues and lower gross margins 
as we considered these factors to be an event that warranted an interim test as to whether the goodwill was impaired  we performed an impairment test as of each of these periods 
the impairment test resulted in no impairment of goodwill as there was an excess in fair value over carrying value in step of the impairment test performed for the second and third quarters of of percent and percent  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of our internal financial forecast for our americas mobile security reporting unit was again adjusted with further changes in our revenue and gross margin resulting from lower 
table of contents expectations in the high security market segment 
in accordance with our policy  we performed an annual assessment of goodwill in the americas mobile security reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and as a result of the annual assessment  it was determined that the fair value of our mobile security reporting unit was impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million to the americas reporting segment in restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations 
see goodwill for further discussion of the impairment test performed 
excess inventory and obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for excess  slow moving and obsolescence to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
as of december   the estimated inventory write downs for excess inventory and obsolescence for inventory on hand was million 
rebates 
we maintain an accrual for customer rebates that totaled million as of december  included in other current liabilities 
this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
restructuring reserves 
employee related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans 
generally  these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the board approves the associated actions  the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable 
in the event that the board approves the associated actions post the balance sheet date  but ultimately confirms the existence of a probable liability as of the balance sheet date  a reasonable estimate of these charges are recorded in the period in which the probable liability existed 
this estimate takes into account all information available as of the date the financial statements are issued 
severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees remaining service periods 
copyright levies 
in many european union eu member countries  the sale of recordable optical media is subject to a private copyright levy 
the levies are intended to compensate copyright holders for fair compensation for the harm caused by private copies made by natural persons of protected works under the european copyright directive  which became effective in directive 
levies are generally charged directly to the importer of the product upon the sale of the products 
payers of levies remit levy payments to collecting societies which  in turn  are intended to distribute funds to copyright holders 
levy systems of eu member countries must comply with the directive  but individual member countries are responsible for administering their own systems 
since implementation  the levy systems have been the subject of numerous litigation and law making activities 
on october   the european court of justice ecj ruled that fair compensation is an autonomous european law concept that was introduced by the directive and must be uniformly applied in all eu member states 
the ecj stated that fair compensation must be calculated based on the harm caused to the authors of protected works by private copying 
the ecj also stated that the indiscriminate application of the private copying levy to devices not made available to private users and clearly reserved for uses other than private copying is incompatible with the directive 
the ecj ruling made clear that copyright holders are only entitled to fair compensation payments funded by levy payments made by the company when sales of optical media are made to natural persons intending to make private copies 
since the directive was implemented in  we have paid approximately million in levies to various ongoing collecting societies related to professional and commercial sales 
based on the ecj october ruling and subsequent litigation and law making activities  we believe that these payments were not consistent with the directive and should not have been paid to the various collecting societies 
accordingly  in we began withholding levy payments on consumer product sales to the various collecting societies 
however  we continued to accrue a liability for levies arising from consumer product sales 
as of december  and  we had recorded a liability of million and million  respectively  associated with levies related to consumer product sales for which we are withholding payment 
at december   the recovery of some or all of the approximately million of copyright levies previously paid on professional and commercial sales represents gain contingency that has not yet met the required criteria for recognition in our financial statements 
there is no assurance that we will realize any of this gain contingency 
since the october ecj ruling  we quarterly evaluate on a country by country basis whether i levies should be accrued on current period commercial and or consumer channel sales  and  ii accrued  but unpaid  copyright levies on prior period consumer product sales should be reversed 
our evaluation is made on a 
table of contents jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and considers ongoing and cumulative developments related to levy litigation and law making activities within each jurisdiction as well as throughout the eu 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was reduced by million due to reversal of prior year obligations that were determined to be remote 
other accrued liabilities 
we also have other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to us 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
defined benefit pension plans 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is december note retirement plans in our notes to consolidated financial statements includes disclosures of these assumptions for both the us and international plans 
the discount rate assumptions are tied to portfolios of long term high quality bonds and are  therefore  subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate used in calculating the benefit obligation in the united states was percent at december   as compared with percent at december  a discount rate reduction of percent increases us pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the investment portfolios for the pension plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the respective portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
we use historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the rate of return used in calculating the us pension plan expense for  and was percent 
a reduction of percent for the expected return on plan assets assumption will increase united states net pension plan expense pre tax by million 
expected returns on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the united states plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
in the united states  we used the rate of percent for beginning in  the projected salary increase assumption was not applicable in the united states due to the elimination of benefit accruals as of january  see note retirement plans in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this change in benefits 
mortality assumptions were obtained from the irs static mortality table

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of our revenue in  may be subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations 
the additional risks include political and economic instability  terrorist activity  the possibility of expropriation  trade tariffs or embargoes  unfavorable tax laws  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
our foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of the foreign currency risks over near term periods  however  we cannot ensure that these risk management activities will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
although we attempt to utilize hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  our revenue or costs are adversely impacted when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs 
in accordance with established policies and procedures  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options  combination option strategies and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging include the accuracy of our forecasts  the volatility of the currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
the utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in note fair value measurements and derivative financial instruments in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures
