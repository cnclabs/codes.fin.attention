overview the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them  the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology  all of which are outside of our control 
as a result  our revenue and gross margins fluctuate from year to year and period to period 
we typically become more efficient in manufacturing products as they mature 
our established cost structure does not vary significantly with changes in volume  which limits our ability to reduce costs in proportion to declining sales 
therefore  we experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenue as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
in december  we sold to lam research corporation the intellectual property rights and other assets relating to our dry strip systems product line 
the purchased intellectual property rights include  among other things  worldwide patent rights  patent applications  copyrights  industrial designs  know how and related rights used by us in our dry strip products 
as a result of this transaction  lam granted us a worldwide  non exclusive  non transferable  royalty free license to use the intellectual property rights sold by us 
the license allows us to make and sell mm dry strip wafer processing equipment for semiconductor applications through september we will continue to sell dry strip systems for smaller wafers until december and support our installed base of dry strip systems indefinitely 
as a result of this continuing interest in the dry strip business  the sale of the intellectual property rights and other assets to lam have been reported in continuing operations 
the sizable expense of building  upgrading or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is increasingly causing semiconductor companies to contract with foundries to manufacture their semiconductors 
in addition  consolidation and partnering within the semiconductor manufacturing industry is increasing 
we expect these trends to continue to reduce the number of our potential customers 
this growing concentration of axcelis customers may increase pricing pressure as higher percentages of our total revenue are tied to the buying decisions of a particular customer or a small number of customers 
our net revenue from our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to   and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
weak industry conditions that began in mid continued through this resulted in a decline in our revenues as compared with  with ongoing weak sales of ion implant and dry strip systems in addition to lower aftermarket revenues  which were negatively impacted by low fab utilization rates and customers holding back on spending for consumables  spare parts and upgrades 
during this period of market uncertainty  we continued to align our organization with market demands 
in addition to tight control of discretionary spending  we also implemented other actions including headcount reductions and three weeks of unpaid shutdowns 
our results also reflect efforts in recent years to lower our breakeven revenue levels to avoid significant losses in a downturn  while continuing to invest a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources in research and development programs 
although future market conditions are difficult to predict  we anticipate the industry will continue to experience similar conditions into in the event that industry conditions cause the demand for our products to decline in future periods  we believe that we can align manufacturing and operating expense levels to changing business conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to support operations 
operating results for the years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future interim periods or years as a whole 
critical accounting estimates management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
management estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for additional accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described below  we consider a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual future service obligations to the customer  the complexity of the customer post delivery acceptance provisions  payment history  customer creditworthiness and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance  we may have to revise our revenue recognition policy  which could delay the timing of revenue recognition 
our system sales transactions are made up of multiple elements  including the system itself and elements that are not delivered simultaneously with the system 
these undelivered elements might include a combination of installation services  extended warranty and support and spare parts  all of which are generally covered by a single sales price 
in january  we adopted the accounting standards update for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  as required  using the prospective method 
accordingly  this guidance is being applied to all system revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  the adoption of the amended guidance did not change the accounting for arrangements entered into prior to january  there was no material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption 
the impact of adopting this amended guidance on our results of operations has been limited to transactions involving the sale of systems 
the update amended the previous guidance for multiple element arrangements 
pursuant to the amended guidance  our system revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer 
if the criteria are met  then the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their relative selling price  and the revenue is recognized separately for each of the separate units 
we determine selling price for each unit of accounting element using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe  if they exist  otherwise  we use best estimated selling price besp 
the company generally expects that it will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of its products  and  as such  the company typically will determine selling price using vsoe or besp 
where required  the company determines besp for an individual element based on consideration of both market and company specific factors  including the selling price and profit margin for similar products  the cost to produce the deliverable and the anticipated margin on that deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold 
the total consideration to be received in the transaction is allocated to each element in the arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each element when compared to the consideration received 
systems are not sold separately and vsoe or tpe is not available for the systems element 
therefore the selling price associated with systems is based on besp 
the allocated value for installation in the arrangement includes a the greater of i the relative selling price of the installation or ii the portion or the sales price that will not be received until the installation is completed the retention 
the selling price of installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed  including labor  which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation at hourly rates  and material components  both of which are sold separately 
the selling price of all other elements extended warranty for support  spare parts  and labor is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately  or vsoe 
product revenue for products which have demonstrated market acceptance  is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  prices are contractually fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue from installation services is recognized at the time formal acceptance is received from the customer or  for certain customers  when both the formal acceptance and retention payment have been received 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
we generally recognize product revenue for systems which have demonstrated market acceptance at the time of shipment because the customer post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory 
while some customers accept axcelis standard specifications  the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer specifications  as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis 
to ensure that the customer specifications are satisfied  many customers request that new systems be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer production environment and the customer criteria are confirmed to have been met 
we believe the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote 
should an installation not be completed successfully  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
for initial shipments of systems with new technologies or in the small number of instances where we are unsure of meeting the customer specifications or obtaining customer acceptance upon shipment of the system  we will defer the recognition of systems revenue and related costs until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts  or based on parts usage  where appropriate 
revenue related to service hours is recognized when the services are performed 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that these assets might not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
future actual performance could be materially different from our current forecasts  which could impact future estimates of undiscounted cash flows and may result in the impairment of the carrying amount of the long lived assets in the future 
this could be caused by strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material adverse change in our relationships with significant customers 
we completed a test for recoverability due to indicators present at december   specifically the carrying value of our net assets exceeded our current market capitalization 
as of december   the undiscounted cash flows used in the analysis significantly exceeded the carrying value of our assets 
as a result no impairment was recorded 
the undiscounted cash flows used in the analysis were derived from our long term strategic plan 
we did not record an impairment charge for the years ended december   or accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a specific assessment of collectability of our customer accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management assumptions of materials usage  based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts or product demand and pricing assumptions  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  pricing  or technical developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that estimates are too optimistic and determine that inventory needs to be written down  the company will recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
in  we recorded a million increase to our inventory reserves 
during the fourth quarter  as a result of industry consensus indicating that the semiconductor industry downturn will continue into  along with our internal projections  we performed a comprehensive review and analysis of our worldwide inventory levels based on historic and projected inventory requirements for all of our products  components and parts 
as a result  we recorded a million increase to inventory reserves in the fourth quarter of product warranty we generally offer a one year warranty for all of our systems  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
for all systems sold  we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of non standard warranty 
costs for non standard warranty are expensed as incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
share based compensation stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally equals the vesting period  based on the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including the expected term of our stock options  volatility of our stock  expected dividends  risk free interest rates over the expected term of the options and the expected forfeiture rate 
we use the straight line attribution method to recognize expense for stock based awards such that the expense associated with awards is evenly recognized throughout the period 
we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors when estimating volatility 
our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted relies on a combination of historical and implied volatility 
we believe that this blended volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market current expectations of future volatility 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise them  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock based award 
the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost is reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
because the company does not recognize the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost due to its cumulative net operating loss position  this had no impact on the company consolidated statement of cash flows as of and for the years ended december   and income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our consolidated financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between financial and income tax accounting 
we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against those net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence such as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
based on our level of deferred tax assets as of december  and our level of historical us losses  we have determined that the current uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
we have also determined that a valuation allowance is required on a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense includes the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
settlements with tax authorities  the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions  or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate 
the company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expense

a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to the decrease in systems sales in and the timing of acceptance of deferred system sales 
service service revenue  which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on site service personnel  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for although service revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems  it can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the need for equipment service 
the decrease during was primarily due to a decrease in fabrication utilization in the semiconductor industry during compared with revenue increased significantly in compared to as the company benefited from improving market conditions and increased capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities during the first half of however during the second half of  deterioration within the industry environment resulted in a decrease in our revenues as compared to the first half of the year 
product product revenue was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue in the increase in product revenue in is attributable to the strengthening of the semiconductor market and a related increase in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers during the first half of however  our revenues decreased during the second half of due to the weakening of the semiconductor market and the related delay in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
in addition  we had delays in key penetrations in the second half of these delays were a function of poor market conditions and issues in our prioritization of new technology 
despite this market slowdown we believe we gained market traction with our single wafer ion implant systems 
during  we also gained market share with our integra dry strip products 
approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to the decrease in systems sales in the second half of and the timing of acceptance of deferred system sales 
service service revenue was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue  for the slight decrease during was primarily due to a decrease in fabrication utilization in the semiconductor industry particularly during the second half of revenue categories used by management as an alternative to the line item revenue categories discussed above  management also uses revenue categorizations which look at revenue by product line the most significant of which is ion implant and by aftermarket  as described below 
compared with ion implant included in total revenue of million in is revenue from sales of ion implantation products and related service of million  or of total revenue  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the dollar decrease was due to the factors discussed above for product revenue 
annual revenue from the sale of ion implantation products and service typically averages from to of total revenue 
aftermarket the company product revenue includes sales of spare parts and product upgrades as well as complete systems 
we refer to the business of selling spare parts and product upgrades  combined with the sale of maintenance labor and service contracts and service hours  as the aftermarket business 
included in total revenue of million in is revenue from our aftermarket business of million  compared to million for aftermarket revenue generally increases with expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service 
the decrease in aftermarket revenue in compared to was due to a decrease in fabrication utilization in the semiconductor industry during compared with ion implant included in total revenue of million in is revenue from sales of ion implantation products and related service of million  or of total revenue  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the dollar increase was due to the factors discussed above for product revenue 
aftermarket included in total revenue of million in is revenue from our aftermarket business of million  compared to million for gross profit gross margin the following table sets forth our gross profit 
years ended december  period to period change years ended december  period to period change dollars in thousands gross profit product product gross margin service service gross margin total gross profit gross margin compared with product gross margin from product revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december   a decrease of percentage points 
gross profit decreased by percentage points due to a higher excess inventory provision of million recorded during the fourth quarter of  as a result of our comprehensive review of our worldwide inventory levels 
lower systems sales volumes and the related unfavorable absorption of fixed overhead costs also contributed to the reduction in gross profit by percentage points 
these decreases were partially offset by an percentage point increase in gross profit resulting from a higher margin mix of parts and upgrade revenue 
service gross margin from service revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in gross profit is attributable to changes in the mix of service contracts and the unfavorable absorption of fixed service costs 
compared with product gross profit from product revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  the increase in gross profit of percentage points is due primarily to a favorable mix of products at higher margins and leveraging our on going efforts to drive labor and material productivity through efficient use of labor and our global sourcing efforts 
service gross profit from service revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in gross profit is attributable to changes in the mix of service contracts and the unfavorable absorption of fixed service costs 
operating expenses the following table sets forth our operating expenses years ended december  period to period change years ended december  period to period change dollars in thousands research and development percentage of revenues sales and marketing percentage of revenues general and administrative percentage of revenues gain on sale of dry strip assets and intellectual property percentage of revenues restructuring charges percentage of revenues total operating expenses percentage of revenues our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  commissions  bonuses  share based compensation and related benefits and taxes  project material costs related to the design and development of new products and enhancement of existing products  and professional fees  travel and depreciation expenses 
personnel costs are our largest expense  representing million  or of our total operating expenses  excluding the gain on sale of the dry strip assets and intellectual property of million and restructuring charges of million  for the year ended december   million  or  of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   and million  or  of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  in  we continued to align our organization with market demands and tightened control over our discretionary spending 
as a result of the current economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  we took a number of actions during to reduce our operating expenses and manage our cash 
these actions included a reduction in our global workforce  focusing our r d spending on critical programs and asking our employees to take three weeks of unpaid shutdowns 
the impact of these actions and our operating results are discussed below 
research and development years ended december  period to period change years ended december  period to period change dollars in thousands research and development percentage of revenues our ability to remain competitive depends largely on continuously developing innovative technology  with new and enhanced features and systems and introducing them at competitive prices on a timely basis 
accordingly  based on our strategic plan  we establish annual r d budgets to fund programs that we expect will drive competitive advantages 
compared with research and development expense was million in  a decrease of approximately million  or  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in payroll costs of million as a result of lowering our headcount through reductions in force and the cost savings realized by three weeks of unpaid furloughs taken by our employees 
as we focused our r d spend on critical programs  consulting and project material costs decreased by million and depreciation expense for internal use assets used as demonstration and or test systems decreased by million 
compared with research and development expense was million in  an increase of million  or  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs of million as a result of an increase in headcount 
depreciation costs for internal use assets used as demonstration and or test systems of million  increased project material costs of million  and increased professional fee expenses million also contributed 
sales and marketing years ended december  period to period change years ended december  period to period change dollars in thousands sales and marketing percentage of revenues our sales and marketing expenses result primarily from the sale of our equipment and services through our direct sales force 
compared with sales and marketing expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in payroll costs of million as a result of lowering our headcount through reductions in force and the cost savings realized by three weeks of unpaid furloughs taken by our employees 
in addition  freight expenses decreased by million due to lower shipments and travel costs decreased by million due to reduced travel 
the decreases in expenses were partially offset by a one time marketing expense of million associated with our evaluation programs and an increase in consulting expenses of million 
compared with sales and marketing expense was million in  an increase of million  or  compared with million in the increase was driven primarily by increased payroll costs of million  increased travel costs of million and increased freight costs of million due to increased system shipments during the first half of  offset by a decrease in supplies and marketing costs of million 
general and administrative years ended december  period to period change years ended december  period to period change dollars in thousands general and administrative percentage of revenues compared with general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or compared with million in the decrease was due to the reduction in payroll costs of million as a result of lowering our headcount through reductions in force and the cost savings realized by three weeks of unpaid furloughs taken by our employees  lower facility related costs of million  which were partially due to the three weeks of plant shutdowns  lower professional fees of million and lower consulting costs of million 
compared with general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or compared with million in the lower general and administrative expense in was driven primarily by decreased incentive compensation expense of million and professional fees of million 
the decrease was partially offset by increased salaries and related expenses of million  which was primarily comprised of increases in salary expense of million  stock compensation expense of million  fringe benefit expense of million and separation costs of million associated with the retirement of a former executive of the company 
gain on sale of dry strip assets and intellectual property on december   we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with lam 
as part of the agreement  we sold our dry strip system assets and intellectual property to lam research 
the purchase price was million  of which million is contingent upon reaching certain milestones 
the million gain on sale of dry strip assets and intellectual property is comprised of the million in proceeds received for the sale  offset by approximately million of product and material costs related to the lab system and other components purchased by lam 
restructuring during  we implemented a reduction in force to improve the focus of our operations  control costs to achieve future profitability and conserve cash 
we recorded a restructuring expense for severance and related costs of million  which included a million non cash charge related to the modification of a share based award during twelve months ended december  approximately million of the restructuring costs were associated with the sale of the dry strip assets and intellectual property 
other income expense compared with other expense was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to other income of million for the twelve months ended december  other income expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to fluctuations of the us dollar against the local currencies of certain of the countries in which we operate  interest earned on our invested cash balances and bank fees associated with maintaining our credit facility 
during the years ended december  and  we had no significant off balance sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts  option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements compared with other income was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to other expense of million for the twelve months ended december  for the year ended december  the company incurred million of foreign exchange gains 
for the year ended december  the company incurred million of foreign exchange losses 
included in foreign exchange losses in are million of foreign exchange losses relating to currency hedging activities 
income taxes income tax expense was million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
our income tax expense is due primarily to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions in europe and asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain european jurisdictions  and  as a result  we do not currently pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions 
additionally  we do not recognize the tax benefit for such losses in the united states and certain european taxing jurisdictions 
during  we settled a tax dispute with a foreign jurisdiction for an amount  million  equal to the charge we had previously recorded in related to an uncertain tax position 
the settlement did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows for the twelve months ended december  during  the company performed an evaluation of the deferred tax assets of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for which we had previously established a valuation allowance 
based on the subsidiaries recent and expected ability to generate taxable income  the company reduced the subsidiaries corresponding valuation allowance and recognized a tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these relate specifically to the operations of our business  for example  the rate of sale of our product lines  and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies  including the availability of credit and the condition of the overall semiconductor equipment industry 
our established cost structure does not vary significantly with changes in volume  which limits our ability to reduce costs in proportion to declining sales 
we have tried to reduce operating expense to achieve profitability towards the lower end of our quarterly revenue swings 
therefore  we experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenue as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
although the company generated operating cash in the third and fourth quarters of  in the full year  million of cash was used to support operating activities 
cash generation in the last two quarters was due to tight management of material purchases 
this compares to cash generated by operations of million in the million increase in cash used by operations in was predominately driven by the company loss from operations excluding non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
the million in cash received in the lam transaction in december  partially offset the use of cash in operations  resulting in cash and cash equivalents at december  of million  compared to million at december  working capital at december  was million 
approximately million of cash was located in foreign jurisdictions as of december  capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures for are projected to remain consistent with future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of expansion of our business and our ability to generate cash to fund them 
we have outstanding standby letters of credit  statutory liability deposits and surety bonds in the amount of million to support certain operating programs  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe  of which million at december  was supported by cash pledged as collateral 
the pledged cash is reflected as current restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following represents our commercial commitments as of december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total surety bonds standby letters of credit statutory liability deposits the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total purchase order commitments operating leases we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  the tax effect of which aggregate million at december  these carryforwards  which expire principally between and  are available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
it is company policy to provide taxes for the total anticipated tax impact of the undistributed earnings of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are not expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
the company anticipates that us tax resulting from remitting such earnings will be off set by net operating loss or credit carryforwards to the extent available 
in addition  the company does not anticipate incurring a foreign withholding tax on remitting such earnings since it does not intend to remit the earnings as dividends 
our revolving credit facility with a bank provides for borrowings up to million based primarily on accounts receivable 
the facility has certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain minimum levels of operating results and liquidity 
the agreement will terminate on april  we use the facility to support letters of credit and for short term borrowing as needed 
at december   our available borrowing capacity under the credit facility was million and we were compliant with all covenants of the loan agreement 
there were no borrowings against this facility during the twelve months ended december  we believe that based on our current market  revenue  expense and cash flow forecasts  our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the short and long term 
in the event that demand for our products declines in future periods  we believe we can align manufacturing and operating spending levels to the changing business conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to support operations 
related party transactions there are no significant related party transactions that require disclosure in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   or in this annual report on form k 
recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists entirely of cash equivalents at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable high investment grade securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio 
due to the nature of our investments  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our sales are billed in us dollars  thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results 
operating margins of certain foreign operations can fluctuate with changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent revenues are billed in us dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local functional currency 
during the years ended december  and  approximately and of our revenue were derived from foreign operations with this inherent risk 
in addition  at both december  and  our operations outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of our total assets  respectively  the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar
