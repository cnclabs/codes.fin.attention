item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
we provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling 
our fleet of offshore drilling rigs  including assets held for sale  consists of semisubmersibles  seven jack ups and five dynamically positioned drillships  four of which are under construction 
we expect two of our new drillships to be delivered in the second and fourth quarters of and the remaining two to be delivered in the second and fourth quarters of our semisubmersible fleet includes the ocean onyx and the ocean apex  which are currently under construction 
we expect the ocean onyx and ocean apex to be available for drilling service in the third quarter of and second quarter of  respectively 
during  we sold six of our jack up rigs  including four rigs that had been cold stacked in previous periods 
currently  three mid water floaters and one jack up rig are being marketed for sale 
market overview international floater market internationally  the ultra deepwater and deepwater floater markets are generally strong and continue to show signs of further strengthening  particularly in the ultra deepwater segment where there are reportedly few  if any  uncontracted rigs available to work in  inclusive of the expected newbuild deliveries 
analyst data at the end of indicated that this market is expected to remain strong throughout we believe that the diminished availability of rigs in this market could continue to put upward pressure on dayrates during however  due to our contracted backlog in and for our ultra deepwater and deepwater fleets  respectively  we have limited availability in this market and may not be able to benefit from higher price fixtures during that period 
see contract drilling backlog 
newbuild orders for ultra deepwater and deepwater floaters continued to be placed in  including our order for a fourth drillship  the ocean blacklion  and our deepwater floater  the ocean apex  both of which are currently under construction 
based on recent analyst data  there are floater rigs  primarily ultra deepwater and deepwater units  on order or under construction  excluding an estimated rigs to be built on behalf of petr leo brasileiro sa  or petrobras  which is currently our most significant customer 
excluding the petrobras ordered rigs  nearly of the floaters scheduled for delivery in and beyond are not yet contracted for future work  including two of our drillships under construction and the ocean apex 
in addition  petrobras has recently announced that it plans to cap the number of its contracted deepwater rigs beginning in according to industry analysts  they believe petrobras intends to fill the majority of its deepwater requirement with its own rigs  which are not yet under construction  but which are scheduled for delivery in and beyond  although industry analysts believe that this timing may be delayed due to current brazilian shipyard limitations 
if imposed by petrobras  this limit on the number of contracted rigs could lead to additional availability and increased competition in the deepwater market in the future 
market demand for mid water floaters is generally stable and is also strengthening in certain geographic markets 
in both the united kingdom  or uk  and norway sectors of the north sea  the mid water market is very strong with industry analysts predicting the next availability of rigs in late a discovery offshore norway has resulted in increased interest in the harsh north sea region  where there is a limited number of rigs capable of working and the barriers to entry are high  primarily due to significant rig modifications necessary to operate in the region 
in february  we announced our plan to upgrade one of our mid water floaters  the ocean patriot  for north sea operations  and the execution of a minimum three year contract for the upgraded rig in the uk sector of the north sea beginning in in the mediterranean region  demand remains solid  including the black sea region where recent gas discoveries have led to increased interest in the region 
the southeast asia and australia markets also remain steady with indications of possible strengthening 
as of the date of this report  industry wide floater utilization is reported to be approximately  and  as of february   our floating rigs in the aggregate were committed for and of and  respectively 
see contract drilling backlog 

table of contents international jack up market four of our marketed jack up rigs are currently operating in the mexican waters of the gulf of mexico  where drilling activity remains stable and additional tendering activity is ongoing 
our other international jack up rig commenced a two year bareboat charter offshore ecuador in the third quarter of gom floater and jack up market drilling activity on the outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico has continued to strengthen and has surpassed pre macondo levels 
additionally  some industry analysts predict that drilling activity  particularly in the ultra deepwater market  will continue to strengthen in and beyond 
however  our ability to meet this demand is limited in the near term 
we currently have two semisubmersibles on contract in the gom  one of which is expected to have limited availability in the second half of we also have one mid water floater and one jack up rig in the gom available for contract  having relocated the ocean ambassador in late and ocean king in early to the gom 
looking forward  we have two ultra deepwater drillships under construction  as well as the ocean apex  none of which have been contracted  which could be positioned in this market 
all three of these rigs are scheduled for delivery in the ocean onyx  which is currently under construction  is expected to commence a one year contract plus potential option periods in the gom during the third quarter of contract drilling backlog the following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of february   october  the date reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and february  the date reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  
contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses 
our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days  however  the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors 
utilization rates  which generally approach during contracted periods  can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including  but not limited to  weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance 
contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation and customer reimbursables 
no revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys 
changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts  as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts

important factors that may impact our operating results  financial condition or cash flows operating income 
our operating income is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized 
the two most significant variables affecting our contract drilling revenue are the dayrates earned and utilization rates achieved by our rigs  each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
we generally recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed 
consequently  when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenue will decrease as a result 

table of contents revenue is also affected by the acquisition or disposal of rigs  rig mobilizations  required surveys and shipyard projects 
in connection with certain drilling contracts  we may receive fees for the mobilization of equipment 
in addition  some of our drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements for which we may be compensated 
we earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
we defer mobilization and contract preparation fees received either lump sum or dayrate  as well as direct and incremental costs associated with the mobilization of equipment and contract preparation activities  and amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 
operating income also fluctuates due to varying levels of contract drilling expenses 
our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment  which generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and short term reductions in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or warm stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if a rig is expected to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
the principal components of our operating costs are  among other things  direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits  repairs and maintenance  freight  regulatory inspections  boat and helicopter rentals and insurance 
labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses 
in general  our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate 
in addition  the costs associated with training new and seasoned employees can be significant 
we expect our labor and training costs to increase in as a result of increased hiring and training activities as we continue the process of crewing our four new drillships 
costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing  as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working 
regulatory surveys and planned downtime 
our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections  which we refer to as a year survey  or special survey  that are due every five years for each of our rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are generally performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs  which are recognized as incurred 
repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year  as well as from quarter to quarter 
in addition  operating income may also be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys  which are performed at interim periods between year surveys 
intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a year survey 
although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig  it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time  except for rigs located in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea 
as a result of anticipated downtime in the current year for rig mobilizations  regulatory surveys and shipyard projects  we expect contract drilling revenue in to decline from the levels attained in during  of our rigs will require year surveys and one of our uk rigs will require dry docking for inspections 
we expect these rigs to be out of service for approximately days in the aggregate 
we also expect to spend an additional approximately days during for intermediate surveys  the mobilization of rigs  contract acceptance testing and extended maintenance projects  including contract preparation work for the ocean endeavor and north sea enhancements for the ocean patriot  each of which is expected to require approximately days of downtime 
we can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections  planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects 
see market overview contract drilling backlog 
physical damage and marine liability insurance 
we are self insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico 
if a named windstorm in the us gulf of mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
under our insurance policy that expires on may   we carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico for which our deductible for physical damage is million per occurrence 
we do not typically retain loss of hire insurance policies to cover our rigs 

table of contents in addition  under our current insurance policy  we carry marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities  including coverage for certain personal injury claims  with no exclusions for pollution and or environmental risk 
we believe that the policy limit for our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business 
our deductibles for marine liability coverage  including for personal injury claims  are million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between million and  if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds  up to million for each subsequent occurrence  depending on the nature  severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year 
construction and capital upgrade projects 
we capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use  and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  which is expected to continue after delivery of the rigs from the shipyard and until the user acceptance phase of each project is completed 
for the year ended december   we capitalized interest of million on qualifying expenditures  primarily related to the construction of our four new drillships and the ocean onyx and the ocean apex 
we will continue capitalizing interest on qualifying expenditures during and expect the amount of interest capitalized to increase  compared to  as construction of two of the drillships and the ocean onyx is scheduled for completion in and final installments and milestone payments will be made on the associated construction contracts 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are included in note general information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
judgments  assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
we carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which upgrade or increase the functionality of our existing equipment and that significantly extend the useful life of an existing asset  are capitalized 
significant judgments  assumptions and estimates may be required in determining whether or not such replacements and betterments meet the criteria for capitalization and in determining useful lives and salvage values of such assets 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
historically  the amount of capital additions requiring significant judgments  assumptions or estimates has not been significant 
during the years ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  in replacements and betterments of our drilling fleet  resulting from numerous projects ranging from  to million per project 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such as cold stacking a rig or excess spending over budget on a newbuild  construction project or major rig upgrade 
we utilize an undiscounted probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following dayrate by rig  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  the per day operating cost for each rig if active  warm stacked or cold stacked  the estimated annual cost for rig replacements and or enhancement programs  the estimated maintenance  inspection or other costs associated with a rig returning to work  salvage value for each rig  and estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of the rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we develop a matrix using several different utilization dayrate scenarios  to each of which we have assigned a probability of occurrence 
the sum of our utilization scenarios which include active  warm stacked and cold stacked and probability of occurrence scenarios both equal in the aggregate 
we reevaluate our cold 
table of contents stacked rigs annually  and we update the matrices for each of our cold stacked rigs at each year end and modify our assumptions giving consideration to the length of time the rig has been cold stacked  the current and expected market for the type of rig and expectations of future oil and gas prices 
further  to test sensitivity  we consider the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant 
we would not necessarily record an impairment if the sensitivity analysis indicated potential cash flows would be insufficient to recover our carrying value 
we would assess other qualitative factors including industry  regulatory and other relevant conditions to determine whether an impairment or further disclosure is warranted 
similarly  when a rig is reclassified to assets held for sale  we measure the asset at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
in the absence of a letter of intent or contract for the rig s sale  we measure the fair value using an expected present value technique that utilizes a probability weighted cash flow analysis  which includes assumptions for estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of the rig 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million in connection with the transfer of three of our mid water semisubmersible rigs to assets held for sale 
see results of operations years ended december   and overview compared to impairment of assets and note general information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
a summary of our cold stacked rigs evaluated for impairment at december   and is as follows december  in millions  except number of rigs mid water floaters jack ups total aggregate net book value we performed an impairment review for each of these rigs using the methodology described above 
based on our analyses  we concluded that these eight and seven rigs were not subject to impairment at december  and  respectively 
there were no cold stacked rigs at december  that were not being marketed for sale 
management s assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
our deductibles for liability coverage for personal injury claims  which primarily result from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  are currently million for the first occurrence  with no aggregate deductible  and vary in amounts ranging between million and  if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds  up to million for each subsequent occurrence  depending on the nature  severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year 
the jones act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee 
we engage outside consultants to assist us in estimating our aggregate liability for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models 
the models used in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims include actuarial assumptions such as claim emergence  or the delay between occurrence and recording of claims  settlement patterns  or the rates at which claims are closed  development patterns  or the rate at which known cases develop to their ultimate level  average  potential frequency and severity of claims  and effect of re opened claims 

table of contents the eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as the severity of personal injuries claimed  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  inconsistent court decisions  and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
we do not establish deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest to finance foreign activities 
however  if these earnings become subject to us federal tax  any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results 
we make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
certain of our international rigs are owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited  or doil  a cayman islands subsidiary which we wholly own 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of doil and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities 
accordingly  we have not made a provision for us income taxes on approximately billion of undistributed foreign earnings and profits 
although we do not intend to repatriate the earnings of doil and have not provided us income taxes for such earnings  except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to us income taxes  these earnings could become subject to us income tax if remitted  or if deemed remitted as a dividend  however  it is not practicable to estimate this potential liability 
in several of the international locations in which we operate  certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries enter into agreements with other of our wholly owned subsidiaries to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations 
we apply a transfer pricing methodology to determine the amount to be charged for providing the services and equipment  and utilize outside consultants to assist us in the development of such transfer pricing methodologies 
in most cases  there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and  if applied  could result in different chargeable amounts 

table of contents results of operations although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations  there is a similarity of economic characteristics due to the nature of the revenue earnings process as it relates to the offshore drilling industry  over the operating lives of our drilling rigs 
we believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting 
however  for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations  we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations

overview compared to operating income 
operating income decreased million  or  during  compared to  primarily due to a million  or  reduction in total contract drilling revenue and a million impairment loss on certain assets held for sale  partially offset by an million  or  decrease in contract drilling expense and a million pre tax gain on the sale of six jack up rigs in both revenue earning days and average daily 
table of contents revenue earned by our deepwater and mid water floaters declined during  compared to  resulting in a million reduction in revenue  while continued favorable market conditions for our ultra deepwater floaters resulted in a million increase in contract drilling revenue 
revenue for our jack up fleet decreased million during  compared to  primarily due to the sale of three jack up rigs that operated during aggregate contract drilling expense for our mid water floater and jack up fleets decreased million during compared to the prior year  primarily due to the movement of certain of our rigs to other operating regions with lower cost structures  combined with lower repair and inspection costs  as well as the absence of operating costs in for the recently sold jack up rigs 
the overall decrease in contract drilling expense during was partially offset by a combined million increase in contract drilling expense for our ultra deepwater and deepwater floaters  primarily due to higher personnel related  inspection  and shorebase support costs in impairment of assets 
in late  our management adopted a plan to actively market for sale three of our mid water semisubmersibles  consisting of two previously cold stacked rigs the ocean epoch and ocean new era and the ocean whittington  which was idled in upon its return from brazil prior to being cold stacked  and the ocean spartan  a previously cold stacked jack up rig 
as a result of this decision  we recognized an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of to write down the aggregate net book value of these rigs to their estimated recoverable amounts  aggregating million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to million in incremental interest costs capitalized during related to our continuing rig construction projects  which now include construction of a fourth drillship and the ocean apex 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for was  compared to an effective tax rate for the higher effective tax rate in was primarily the result of differences in the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings and losses  as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the impact of a tax law provision that expired at the end of this provision allowed us to defer recognition of certain foreign earnings for us tax purposes during  which deferral was unavailable in our tax expense also included the reversal of million of us income tax expense  originally recognized in  related to our intention at that time to repatriate certain foreign earnings  which changed in subsequent to our decision to build new drillships overseas 
the american taxpayer relief act of  or the act  was signed into law on january  the act extends through several expired or expiring temporary business provisions  commonly referred to as extenders  which are retroactively extended to the beginning of one of the extenders will again allow us to defer recognition of certain foreign earnings for us tax purposes 
as required by gaap  the effects of new legislation are recognized when signed into law 
consequently  we expect to reduce our first quarter tax expense by approximately million as a result of recognizing the effect of the extenders 
as our rigs frequently operate in different tax jurisdictions as they move from contract to contract  our effective tax rate can fluctuate substantially and our historical effective tax rates may not be sustainable and could increase materially 
compared to operating income 
total operating income in decreased million  or  compared to  despite a million  or  increase in total contract drilling revenue during revenue generated by our floater rigs increased an aggregate million  or  in compared to  while revenue generated by our jack up fleet declined million or 
except for our deepwater floaters  average daily revenue earned by our other rigs during compared unfavorably to the levels attained in utilization for our ultra deepwater and deepwater floaters increased significantly in compared to  however  utilization for our mid water floater and jack ups fleets decreased in one additional mid water floater and one jack up rig were cold stacked during the ocean courage and ocean valor  which began operating under contract late in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of  respectively  contributed incremental revenue of million during total contract drilling expense increased million  or  during compared to  and reflected incremental contract drilling expense for the ocean courage and ocean valor  higher amortized mobilization costs and higher other operating costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically 

table of contents other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended december  and were as follows bad debt recovery expense 
during  we recorded a million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in egypt and recovered million in previously recorded reserves for bad debts 
during  we recovered million and million related to previously established reserves for bad debts related to our operations in egypt and the uk  respectively 
gain on disposition of assets 
during  we recognized an aggregate million gain on the disposition of assets  primarily related to the sale of used equipment  compared to an aggregate million net gain recognized in the prior year 
during  we sold the ocean shield for net proceeds of million and recognized a net gain on sale of million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to million of interest capitalized in on our three drillships under construction at that time 
in addition  during  we recorded million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions compared to million during income tax expense 
our effective tax rate for was  compared to a effective tax rate for the lower effective tax rate in was primarily the result of differences in the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings and losses  as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
a tax law provision that expired at the end of but was subsequently signed back into law in december also contributed to our lower effective tax rate in this provision allowed us to defer recognition of certain foreign earnings for us tax purposes 
the extension of this tax law provision  and our decisions to build three new drillships overseas  caused us to reassess our intent to repatriate certain foreign earnings to the us we plan to reinvest these earnings internationally  and consequently  we no longer provide us income taxes on these earnings 
during the year ended december   we reversed the million of us income taxes that had been provided in for these earnings 
on december   the statute of limitations relative to a uncertain tax position in brazil expired 
as a consequence  in we reversed million of previously accrued interest expense and million of previously accrued tax expense  million of which had been accrued for penalties 
during  we accrued approximately million of expense for uncertain tax positions  primarily in mexico and brazil  of which million was interest and million was penalty related 
contract drilling revenue and expense by equipment type compared to ultra deepwater floaters 
revenue generated by our ultra deepwater floaters increased million during  compared to  primarily due to higher average daily revenue earned by our ultra deepwater fleet million and incremental revenue earning days million 
average daily revenue earned increased primarily due to higher dayrates earned by the ocean monarch operating offshore vietnam and indonesia during  compared to the average dayrate earned by the rig operating in the gom during total revenue earning days increased during primarily due to the inclusion of incremental revenue earnings days for the ocean monarch  compared to when the rig incurred downtime associated with a force majeure assertion by a customer that was ultimately settled in april and mobilization of the rig to vietnam 
the increase in aggregate revenue earning days during was partially offset by downtime associated with scheduled surveys and shipyard projects  as well as unscheduled downtime for repairs for other rigs in our ultra deepwater fleet 
contract drilling expense in for our ultra deepwater fleet included million in incremental costs for the ocean monarch  which experienced a higher cost structure operating internationally for the full year  as well as costs associated with its shipyard survey  compared to  when the rig was located in the gom for a portion of the year 
in addition  contract drilling expense for our other ultra deepwater floaters increased compared to  reflecting higher costs relating to personnel million  inspections million  freight  customs and duties million and shorebase support million  as well as losses on foreign currency hedges 
table of contents million  partially offset by lower costs incurred for maintenance and repairs million and amortized mobilization expense million 
many of these costs are difficult to predict by their nature and vary based on the local laws and practices in the international locations in which our ultra deepwater floaters operate

revenue generated by our deepwater floaters decreased million in  compared to  as a result of lower average daily revenue earned million  fewer revenue earning days million  and lower recognition of amortized mobilization revenue million 
average daily revenue earned was negatively impacted by the completion of the ocean valiant s initial contract offshore angola in december  which was at a significantly higher dayrate than the rig earned during the decline in revenue earning days during was primarily attributable to days of incremental downtime for shipyard projects and inspections compared to contract drilling expense incurred by our deepwater floaters increased million during  compared to  primarily due to the repair and inspection costs associated with surveys and shipyard projects for the ocean star and ocean victory and higher personnel related costs  partially offset by the absence of certain regional costs associated with the ocean valiant s contract offshore angola during mid water floaters 
revenue generated by our mid water floaters decreased million during  compared to  primarily due to fewer revenue earning days million 
the reduction in revenue earning days in  compared to  reflects incremental downtime days for the ocean whittington  which completed its contract in brazil and is now marketed for sale  as well as unplanned downtime for repairs and the warm stacking of rigs between contracts additional days  planned downtime for mobilization of rigs and shipyard projects additional days  and additional cold stacked days for the ocean epoch 
revenue for  compared to the prior year  was further reduced by a decrease in average daily revenue earned million and lower amortized mobilization revenue million 
contract drilling expense for our fleet of eighteen mid water floaters decreased million during compared to significant events or changes that affected the comparability in contract drilling expense between and were the relocation of rigs between geographic locations and any related changes in operating cost structures or the cost to mobilize such rigs  the number and extent of shipyard surveys  the stacking of rigs and rising labor costs in the north sea region  primarily in norway 
in the aggregate  contract drilling expense for  compared to  reflected lower costs for rig maintenance  repairs and inspections million  personnel related million  freight  customs and duties million  revenue based agency fees million  and shorebase support million  partially offset by higher recognized mobilization costs million and losses on foreign currency hedges million 
jack ups 
revenue and contract drilling expense for our jack up rigs decreased million and million  respectively  in  compared to  primarily due to the sale of six jack up rigs in  which resulted in an incremental reduction of revenue and contract drilling expense of million and million  respectively  comparing the two years 
the decrease in contract drilling expense  compared to  also reflected a million reduction in expense for the ocean scepter  primarily due to the absence of costs associated with return of the rig to the gom in  lower amortized mobilization expenses and the effect of a lower operating cost structure offshore mexico than in brazil 
compared to ultra deepwater floaters 
revenue generated by our ultra deepwater floaters increased million during compared to the ocean courage and ocean valor  which began operating under dayrate contracts in february and october  respectively  were under contract in brazil for all of and worked a combined incremental revenue earning days that generated million in incremental revenue 
however  aggregate revenue earned by our six other ultra deepwater rigs decreased million in  compared to  due to a reduction in average daily revenue earned million  partially offset by an increase in revenue earning days million due to the absence of downtime in associated with the relocation of the ocean endeavor  ocean confidence and ocean baroness from the gom to international locations in the previous year 
in addition  revenue was unfavorably impacted by the absence of a million contract termination fee earned by the ocean endeavor in july  partially offset by higher recognition of mobilization revenue during million 
contract drilling expense for our ultra deepwater floaters increased million in  compared to  and included million in incremental contract drilling expense from the operation of the ocean courage and ocean valor  million in incremental mobilization expenses  and higher overall contract drilling expenses for the remainder of our fleet  including personnel related  maintenance and hull insurance costs  as well as higher costs associated with operating rigs internationally  such as freight  non income based taxes  revenue based agency fees and shorebase support costs 

table of contents deepwater floaters 
revenue generated by our deepwater floaters increased million in  compared to  primarily due to additional revenue earning days million and an increase in average daily revenue earned million 
the increase in revenue earning days in resulted from fewer non operating days for repairs  inspections and contract preparation activities  fewer rig mobilization days and fewer days in which rigs were warm stacked between contracts  compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue was partially offset by the recognition of less amortized mobilization revenue in compared to million 
contract drilling expense increased million in  compared to  primarily due to the ocean america operating offshore australia for all of  compared to when the rig did not commence drilling operations until june million 
higher incremental contract drilling expense was partially offset by a million reduction in recognized mobilization costs due to the full amortization of previously deferred costs as rigs completed their initial contracts and the absence of mobilization costs associated with the ocean alliance s shipyard project in mid water floaters 
revenue generated by our mid water floaters decreased million in  compared to  primarily due to fewer revenue earning days million combined with a decrease in average daily revenue earned million in the decrease in revenue earning days was primarily attributable to additional cold stacked days in compared to  partially offset by fewer warm stacked days between contracts fewer days  unpaid downtime for repairs fewer days and rig mobilization days fewer days 
the decline in revenue was partially offset by higher mobilization fees recognized during million  compared to  primarily due to a million demobilization fee earned by the ocean yorktown upon completion of its contract offshore brazil 
contract drilling expense decreased million during compared to contributing to the overall decrease in contract drilling expense between periods was a million reduction in costs associated with cold stacked rigs  partially offset by higher contract drilling expense for our actively marketed fleet of mid water floaters 
cost increases in  compared to  included personnel related costs million  repairs and maintenance expenses million  shorebase support and overhead costs million  as well as costs associated with the demobilization of the ocean yorktown to the gom in advance of the rig s future work in mexico in early jack ups 
revenue earned by our jack up rigs decreased million in  compared to  primarily due to fewer revenue earning days million in  and reflected the impact of rigs cold stacked during the periods fewer days  the sale of the ocean shield in july fewer days and an increase in warm stacked days between contracts days  partially offset by fewer non revenue earning days for repairs and mobilization of rigs 
contract drilling expense declined million in  compared to  primarily due to reduced expense for our cold stacked rigs million and the ocean shield million 
contract drilling expense for our actively marketed jack up rigs increased million during  primarily due to higher rig mobilization costs  including costs related to the mobilization of the ocean scepter to the gom  inspection costs and hull insurance 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically relied principally on our cash flows from operations and cash reserves to meet liquidity needs and fund our cash requirements 
in addition  we currently have available a million credit facility to meet our short term and long term liquidity needs 
see credit agreement and long term debt million revolving credit agreement 
at the date of this report  our contract drilling backlog was billion  of which billion is expected to be earned in at december   and  we had cash available for current operations as follows december  in thousands cash and equivalents marketable securities total cash available for current operations 
table of contents a substantial portion of our cash flows has been and is expected to continue to be invested in the enhancement of our drilling fleet 
we determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating our rig construction obligations  the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and our ongoing rig equipment enhancement replacement programs 
we pay dividends at the discretion of our board of directors  or board  and  in recent years  we have a history of paying both regular quarterly and special cash dividends 
see market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividend policy in item of this report 
during the three year period ended december   we paid regular cash dividends totaling million and special cash dividends totaling billion 
our board has adopted a policy to consider paying special cash dividends  in amounts to be determined  on a quarterly basis 
our board may  in subsequent quarters  consider paying additional special cash dividends  in amounts to be determined 
any determination to declare a special cash dividend  as well as the amount of any special cash dividend which may be declared  will be based on our financial position  earnings  earnings outlook  capital spending plans and other factors that our board considers relevant at that time 
on february   we declared a regular cash dividend and a special cash dividend of and  respectively  per share of our common stock 
both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  certain of our international rigs are owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by doil  and  as a result of our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of doil to finance our foreign activities  we do not expect such earnings to be available for distribution to our stockholders or to finance our domestic activities 
see market overview critical accounting estimates income taxes 
however  we believe that the operating cash flows generated by and cash reserves of doil and the operating cash flows available to and cash reserves of diamond offshore drilling  inc will be sufficient to meet their respective working capital requirements and capital commitments over the next twelve months 
we will  however  continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required 
during the three year period ended december   our primary source of cash was an aggregate billion generated from operating activities and million of proceeds from the sale of seven drilling rigs  including the sale of the ocean shield in our primary uses of cash during the same period were billion towards the construction of new rigs and our ongoing rig equipment enhancement replacement program and billion for the payment of dividends 
in addition  we may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes 
our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on our results of operations  our current financial condition  current market conditions and other factors beyond our control 
cash flow and capital expenditures our cash flow from operations and capital expenditures for each of the years in the three year period ended december  were as follows year ended december  in thousands cash flow from operations capital expenditures drillship construction construction of deepwater floaters ongoing rig equipment and replacements programs total capital expenditures cash flow 
cash flow from operations decreased approximately million during  compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in cash receipts from contract drilling services  partially offset by lower cash payments related to contract drilling expenses of million and lower cash income taxes paid  net of refunds  of million 

table of contents cash flow from operations increased approximately million during  compared to  primarily due to a reduction in cash income taxes paid  net of refunds  of million 
however  this reduction in cash outflows from operations was partially offset by a million decrease in cash receipts from contract drilling services and higher cash payments related to contract drilling expenses of million

other currency risk 
some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations 
currency environments in which we have significant business operations include brazil  the uk  australia and mexico 
when possible  we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in us dollars 
at present  however  only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in us dollars and the local currency 
to the extent that we are not able to cover our local currency operating costs with customer payments in the local currency  we also utilize forex contracts to reduce our currency exchange risk 
our forex contracts may obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date  which  for most of our contracts  is the average spot rate for the contract period

our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  and  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 

table of contents exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and  due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
our long term debt  as of december  and  is denominated in us dollars 
our existing debt has been issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
it is customary for us to enter into forex contracts in the normal course of business 
these contracts generally require us to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date  which for most of our contracts is the average spot rate for the contract period 
as of december   we had forex contracts outstanding in the aggregate notional amount of million  consisting of million in australian dollars  million in brazilian reais  million in british pounds sterling and million in mexican pesos 
these contracts generally settle monthly through september at december   we have presented the fair value of our outstanding forex contracts as a current asset of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of  in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report
