risk factors any of the following factors could have a material adverse affect on our future operating results as well as other factors included in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations information concerning forward looking statements 
risks relating to our business our sales could decline due to macro economic factors  cyclicality of the industry  regulatory changes and other factors outside of our control 
changes in economic conditions  cyclical downturns in our industry  regulatory changes impacting the purchasing patterns of commercial vehicles  and changes in the local economies of the countries or regions in which we sell our products  such as changes in consumer confidence  increases in interest rates and increases in unemployment  could affect demand for our products  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
demand for new trucks and buses in the markets in which we operate has a significant impact on our sales 
in  heavy truck and bus production has decreased in europe  our largest market which accounted for approximately of our total sales 
adverse economic conditions in our markets  particularly in europe  and other factors may cause our customers to reduce truck and bus production  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a global recession would negatively impact our customers and result in reduced demand for our products  which would therefore have a significant negative impact on our business 
during the recent global recession  the credit markets experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by significantly reduced availability of credit and increased borrowing costs 
the disruptions in the credit markets and impacts of the global recession negatively impacted consumer spending patterns and caused our customers to reduce truck and bus production 
during  the commercial vehicle industry experienced an abrupt slowdown to the significant recovery seen in and in our more developed markets  in addition to double digit declines in some of our emerging markets  namely brazil and china 
a further or double dip global recession could cause our customers to again reduce truck and bus production  which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations  our operating cash flows and our financial condition 
our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and the translation of local currency results into us dollars could negatively impact our results of operations 
we conduct business through subsidiaries in many different countries  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations  which are presented in us dollars 
in  approximately of our combined sales occurred outside of the united states 
a significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in best cost countries and sold in various countries 
cross border transactions  both with external parties and intercompany relationships  result in exposure to foreign currency exchange effects 
accordingly  significant unfavorable changes in the exchange rates of the euro  us dollar and other applicable currencies could negatively impact our results of operations 
additionally  our results of operations are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar results in unfavorable or favorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 
we are subject to general risks associated with our foreign operations 
in addition to the currency exchange risks inherent in operating in many different foreign countries  there are other risks inherent in our international operations 
the risks related to our foreign operations that we more often face in the normal course of business include changes in non us tax law  increases in non us tax rates and the amount of non us earnings relative to total combined earnings could change and impact our combined tax rate  foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  price or exchange controls  or other restrictions  general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries  
table of contents we may have difficulty complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  some of which may conflict with united states law  and the uncertainty created by this legal environment could limit our ability to effectively enforce our rights in certain markets  and in several of the countries in which we do business  we rely upon the ongoing performance of our joint venture partners who bear risks similar to our risks and also may include obligations they have under related shareholders agreements and risk of being denied access to the capital markets which could lead to resource demands on the company in order to maintain or advance its strategy 
the ability to manage these risks could be difficult and may limit our operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products internationally more difficult  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
if we are unable to obtain component parts or obtain them at reasonable price levels  our ability to maintain existing sales margins may be affected 
we purchase a broad range of materials and components throughout the world in connection with our manufacturing activities 
major items include electronic components and parts containing aluminum  steel  copper  zinc  rubber and plastics 
the cost of components and parts  and the raw materials used therein  represents a significant portion of our total costs 
price increases of the underlying commodities may adversely affect our results of operations 
although we maintain alternative sources for components and parts  our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials 
the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components or to do so at reasonable prices could have a temporary adverse effect on our production of certain products or the cost at which we can produce those products 
any change in the supply or price of raw materials could materially adversely affect our future business and results of operations 
if we are not able to maintain good relations with our employees  we could suffer work stoppages that could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
employees located in our sites in europe  asia and south america are subject to collective bargaining  with internal company agreements or external agreements at the region or country level 
currently of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements 
these employees right to strike is typically protected by law and union membership is confidential information which does not have to be provided to the employer 
our us facilities are non union 
any disputes with our employee base could result in work stoppages or labor protests  which could disrupt our operations 
any such labor disputes could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
in october  we faced a three week strike in brazil due to a regional union action organized around the annual salary increase negotiation 
this action was targeted against all companies active in the region in which we operate 
we are dependent on key customers 
we rely on several key customers 
for the fiscal year ending december   sales to our top three customers accounted for approximately daimler  volvo and meritor wabco our owned joint venture in north america  respectively  of our sales  and sales to our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our sales 
many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical industries and  as a result  their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays or cancellations 
as a result of dependence on our key customers  we have experienced and could experience in the future a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if any of the following were to occur the loss of any key customer  in whole or in part  a declining market in which customers reduce orders or demand reduced prices  or a strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility  which could affect both its suppliers and customers 
we are subject to price reduction demands from our oem customers 
these price reductions could adversely affect the results of our operations downward pricing pressure is a characteristic of the automotive industry  and as with other suppliers to commercial vehicle oems  we continue to experience price reduction demands from our customers 
in the face of lower prices to customers  we must reduce our operating costs in order to maintain profitability 
whilst we have successfully implemented cost reduction initiatives  we anticipate our customers will continue to pursue aggressive pricing strategies 
if the company is unable to offset customer price reductions through improved operating efficiencies  new manufacturing processes  sourcing 
table of contents alternatives  technology enhancements and other initiatives  or if we are unable to avoid price reductions from our customers  the results of our operations could be adversely affected 
if there are changes in the environmental or other regulations that affect one or more of our current or future products  it could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
we are currently subject to various environmental and other regulations in the us and internationally 
a risk of environmental liability is inherent in our current and former manufacturing activities 
under certain environmental laws  we could be held jointly and severally responsible for the remediation of any hazardous substance contamination at our past and present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites and could also be held liable for damages to natural resources and any consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other environmental damage 
while we have a number of proactive programs underway to minimize the impact of the production and use of our products on the environment and believe that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations  we cannot predict whether there will be changes in the environmental regulations affecting our products 
any changes in the environmental and other regulations which affect our current or future products could have a negative impact on our business if we are unable to adjust our product offering to comply with such regulatory changes 
in addition  it is possible that we will incur increased costs as a result of complying with environmental regulations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to product liability  warranty and recall claims  which may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results  or are alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
while we maintain reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such exposures  large product liability claims  if made  could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs to defend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in the future 
in addition  if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products 
in the past five years  our warranty expense has fluctuated between approximately and of sales on an annual basis 
individual quarters were above or below the annual averages 
the future cost associated with providing product warranties and or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to plan our capacity well in advance of production and our success depends on having available capacity and effectively using it 
we principally compete for new business at the beginning of the development of our customers new products 
our customers new product development generally begins significantly prior to the marketing and production of their new products and our supply of our products generally lasts for the life of our customers products 
nevertheless  our customers may move business to other suppliers or request price reductions during the life cycle of a product 
the long development and sales cycle of our new products  combined with the specialized nature of many of our facilities and the resulting difficulty in shifting work from one facility to another  could result in variances in capacity utilization 
in order to meet our customers requirements  we may be required to supply our customers regardless of cost and consequently we may suffer an adverse impact on our operating profit margins and results of operations 
we must continue to make technological advances  or we may not be able to successfully compete in our industry 
we operate in an industry in which technological advancements are necessary to remain competitive 
accordingly  we devote substantial resources to improve already technologically complex products and to remain a leader in technological innovation 
however  if we fail to continue to make technological improvements or our competitors develop technologically superior products  it could have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
the public company accounting oversight board  or pcaob  is currently unable to inspect the audit work and practices of auditors operating in belgium  including our auditor 
our auditors  ernst young bedrijfsrevisoren bcvba reviseurs d entreprises sccrl  are registered with the public company accounting oversight board pcaob 
our auditors  like any other independent registered public accounting firms operating in belgium  are not permitted  because of belgian law restrictions  to be subject to inspections by the pcaob that

risks relating to the separation we have agreed to indemnify trane for taxes and related losses resulting from certain actions that may cause the distribution to fail to qualify as a tax free transaction 
trane has received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that the distribution qualifies as tax free for us federal income tax purposes under section of the internal revenue code the code 
in addition  trane has received an opinion of skadden  arps  slate  meagher flom llp  tax counsel to trane  substantially to the effect that the distribution will qualify as tax free to trane  us and our shareholders under section and related provisions of the code 
the ruling and opinion were based on  among other things  certain assumptions as well as on the accuracy of certain factual representations and statements made by trane and us 
in rendering its ruling  the irs also relied on certain covenants that wabco and trane entered into  including the adherence to certain restrictions on trane and wabco future actions 
notwithstanding receipt by trane of the private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel  the irs could assert that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction 
if the distribution fails to qualify for tax free treatment  then trane would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of i the fair market value of our common stock distributed to the trane shareholders over ii trane tax basis in such common stock 
under the terms of the tax sharing agreement  in the event the distribution were to fail to qualify as a tax free reorganization and such failure was not the result of actions taken after the distribution by trane or any of its subsidiaries or shareholders  we would be responsible for all taxes imposed on trane as a result thereof 
in addition  each trane shareholder who received our common stock in the distribution generally would be treated as having received a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received including any fractional share sold on behalf of the shareholder  which would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of the shareholder ratable share of trane current and accumulated earnings and profits as increased to reflect any current income including any gain recognized by trane on the taxable distribution 
the balance  if any  of the distribution would be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the trane shareholder tax basis in its trane stock  with any remaining amount being taxed as capital gain 
our obligation to indemnify trane under the tax sharing agreement if the distribution fails to qualify for tax free treatment could be substantial if triggered  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are responsible for certain of trane contingent and other corporate liabilities 
under the indemnification and cooperation agreement  the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement  our wholly owned subsidiary wabco europe bvba has assumed and is responsible for certain contingent liabilities related to trane business including certain associated costs and expenses  whether arising prior to  at or after the distribution and will indemnify trane for these liabilities 
among the contingent liabilities against which we will indemnify trane and the other indemnities  are liabilities associated with certain non us tax liabilities and certain us and us environmental liabilities associated with certain trane entities 
we will indemnify trane  ideal standard international  including certain former european subsidiaries and affiliates of the former american standard group  and their respective owners against any fines associated with an investigation into alleged infringement of european union competition regulations 
as part of a multi company investigation  american standard and certain of its european subsidiaries engaged in the bath and kitchen business were charged by the european commission for alleged infringements of european union competition rules relating to the distribution of bathroom fixtures and fittings in a number of european countries 
pursuant to the indemnification and cooperation agreement  wabco europe bvba an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wabco will be responsible for  and will indemnify american standard now trane and ideal standard international including certain subsidiaries engaged  or formerly engaged in the bath and kitchen business and their respective affiliates 
as required by the indemnification and cooperation agreement  wabco paid the fine amount into escrow on august  and those funds were subsequently released from escrow and paid to the commission 
after reviewing all of the elements of the case  wabco decided to appeal the decision in order to try to have the fine reduced 
on september   wabco filed its appeal in the general court of the european union  located in luxembourg 
on march   the oral hearing for the appeal took place before the court 
this was the final step in the procedure before a judgment is handed down 
the company anticipates that a decision on the appeal will be made before the end of 
table of contents risks relating to our common stock your percentage ownership in wabco may be diluted in the future 
your percentage ownership in wabco may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that have already been granted and that we expect will be granted to our directors and officers in the future under our omnibus incentive plan 
in addition  we may in the future issue additional equity securities  subject to limitations imposed by the tax sharing agreement  in order to fund working capital needs  capital expenditures and product development  or to make acquisitions and other investments  which may dilute your ownership interest 
we cannot assure you that we will pay any dividends or repurchase shares 
while we have historically returned value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and or dividends  our ability to repurchase shares and pay dividends is limited by available cash  contingent liabilities and surplus 
moreover  all decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends and share repurchases will be at the sole discretion of our board and will be evaluated from time to time in light of our financial condition  earnings  capital requirements of our business  covenants associated with certain debt obligations  legal requirements  regulatory constraints  industry practice and other factors that our board deems relevant 
our shareholder rights plan and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated by laws and delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
these provisions include  among others a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms  elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent  rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings  the right of our board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
on july   our board adopted a shareholder rights plan  which provides  among other things  that when specified events occur  our shareholders will be entitled to purchase from us a newly created series of junior preferred stock 
the preferred stock purchase rights are triggered by the earlier to occur of i ten business days or a later date determined by our board of directors before the rights are separated from our common stock after the public announcement that a person or group has become an acquiring person by acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common stock or ii ten business days or a later date determined by our board before the rights are separated from our common stock after a person or group begins a tender or exchange offer that  if completed  would result in that person or group becoming an acquiring person 
the issuance of preferred stock pursuant to the shareholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal 
these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 
however  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in the best interests of our shareholders and our company

table of contents contractual obligations following is a summary of contractual obligations as of december  aggregate contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligation total and and beyond debt obligations principal plus interest operating lease obligations tax indemnifications purchase obligations unfunded pension and post retirement benefits tax liabilities total the amounts and timing of such obligations  as shown in the table may vary substantially from amounts that will actually be paid in future years 
for example  the actual amount to be paid under debt obligations under our revolving credit facility will depend on the amount of debt outstanding under the agreement in each year 
amounts shown for debt obligations include the associated interest amounting to million  calculated at the december  rates applicable to each type of debt 
amounts include future rental commitments under all non cancelable operating leases in effect at december  amounts are probable and estimable costs that the company is responsible for under a tax sharing agreement between trane and wabco 
the entire million is classified as long term and the company is currently unable to estimate the timing of the potential amounts to be paid 
in the normal course of business we expect to purchase approximately billion in of materials and services  and estimate that on average no more than approximately million is outstanding at any one time in the form of legally binding commitments 
we spent approximately billion  billion and billion on materials and services in  and  respectively 
amounts represent undiscounted projected benefit payments to wabco unfunded plans over the next ten years  as well as expected contributions to funded pension plans for the expected benefit payments are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our accumulated benefit obligation at the end of and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service of current employees 
amounts represent the company unrecognized tax benefits including interest of million potentially owed to tax authorities as described in note income taxes 
the remaining million liability is classified as long term and the company is currently unable to estimate the timing of potential amounts to be paid 
capital expenditures we believe our capital spending in recent years has been sufficient to maintain efficient production capacity  to implement important product and process redesigns and to expand capacity to meet increased demand 
productivity projects have freed up capacity in our manufacturing facilities and are expected to continue to do so 
we expect to continue investing to expand and modernize our existing facilities and invest in our facilities to create capacity for new product development 
pending adoptions of recently issued accounting standards we do not expect the pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires us to make judgments and 
table of contents estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
those judgments and estimates have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements because they result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we frequently re evaluate our judgments and estimates that are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the ones that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty  judgment and complexity are allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  property  plant and equipment  goodwill  stock based compensation  post retirement benefits  warranties  income taxes  and contingencies 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  on a monthly basis  wabco analyzes the aging of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  availability of credit insurance and current economic trends 
though management considers the valuation of the allowances proper and adequate  changes in the economy and or deterioration of the financial condition of the company customers could affect the reserve balances required 
historically  this valuation has proved to be a reasonable estimate of the company experience with doubtful debts 
inventory reserves on a quarterly basis  the company tests its inventory for slow moving and obsolete stock by considering both the historical and expected sales and the company will record a provision  if needed 
historically  this policy has given a close approximation of the company experience with slow moving and obsolete inventory 
from time to time unusual buying patterns or shifts in demand may cause large movements in the reserve 
property  plant equipment property  plant and equipment balances are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
wabco capitalizes costs  including interest during construction of fixed asset additions  improvements  and betterments that add to productive capacity or extend the asset life 
wabco assesses facilities for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
goodwill the company has a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet that is not amortized  but subject to impairment tests each fiscal year on october st or more often when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the company impairment tests utilize the two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured based on one reporting unit for the total company 
wabco plants  engineering  technical support  distribution centers and other support functions are shared among various product families and serve all distribution channels with many customers 
based on the organizational structure  as well as the nature of financial information available and reviewed by the company chief operating decision maker to assess performance and make decisions about resource allocations  the company has concluded that its total wabco operations represent one reportable unit and that wabco performance and future net cash flow perspectives are best understood and assessed as such 
in order to approximate the fair value of the reporting unit for purposes of testing recoverability  we use the total market capitalization of the company  a market approach  which is then compared to the total book value of the company 
in the event the company fair value has fallen below book value  the company will compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill  the company will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 
there has been no impairment of goodwill during  and the company goodwill was not at risk for failing the first step of its impairment test 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes in its combined statement of income the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock grants based on estimated fair values 
the company utilizes the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for each option award 
there are several assumptions that must be made when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends to be paid and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of us treasury securities that 
table of contents correspond to the expected holding period of the options 
wabco reviewed the historic volatility of its common stock over a four year period  the common stock of its peer group over a five year period  and the implied volatility for at the money options to purchase shares of its common stock 
the five year historical volatility period was selected since that period corresponds with the expected holding period 
based on this data  the company chose to use a weighted average of the implied volatility of wabco  the most recent four year historical volatility of wabco and the median most recent one year historical volatility of wabco peer group prior to the spin off date 
the expected holding period was calculated by reviewing the historical exercise pattern of all holders that were granted options and the exercise behavior of officers versus non officers 
the results of the analysis support one expected holding period for all groups of employees 
the expected forfeiture rate was determined based on the historical stock option forfeiture data of the company 
the dividend yield was based on an expected future dividend rate for the period at the time of grant 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of wabco common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and expected performance of wabco stock 
an increase in the volatility of wabco stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards 
an increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense 
dividend yields and risk free interest rates are less difficult to estimate 
an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
commencing in  the company will replace stock options with performance share units psus  the vesting of which would occur  if at all  and at levels depending upon  the achievement of three year cumulative performance earnings per share goals approved by the compensation  nominating and governance committee of the board of directors 
post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  merit and promotion increases and the health care cost trend rate 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and health care costs  in making its assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the assumptions as to the expected long term rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets  historical long term rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions 
the discount rate used for us plans reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income investments on the company annual measurement date december and is subject to change each year 
the discount rate was determined by matching  on an approximate basis  the coupons and maturities for a portfolio of corporate bonds rated aa or better by moody investor services to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the projected benefit obligation 
the discount rates used for plans outside the us are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities  the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment 
a decrease of one percentage point in the assumed rate of return on plan assets and a decrease of one percentage point in the discount rate applied to projected benefit obligations would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
an increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate in each future year would not materially increase annual health insurance costs 
the impact of health care reform legislation in the us is immaterial to wabco 
see the disclosures about pension and post retirement obligations  the composition of plan assets  assumptions and other matters in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
warranties products sold by wabco are covered by a basic limited warranty with terms and conditions that vary depending upon the product and country in which it was sold 
the limited warranty covers the equipment  parts and labor in certain cases necessary to satisfy the warranty obligation generally for a period of two years 
estimated product warranty expenses are accrued in cost of goods sold at the time the related sale is recognized 
estimates of warranty expenses are based primarily on warranty claims experience and specific customer contracts 
warranty expenses include accruals for basic warranties for product sold  as well as accruals for product recalls  service campaigns and other related events when they are known and estimable 
to the extent we experience changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual is adjusted accordingly 
warranty accrual estimates are updated based upon the most current warranty claims information available 
the company warranty costs as a percentage of net sales totaled in  in and in we do not expect this percentage to change in the near future 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a three year summary of warranty costs 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
deferred tax assets have been reduced by a 
table of contents valuation allowance of million at december  foreign exchange rates related to foreign net operating losses 
we calculated this valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of asc  income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets  when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards  applicable tax rates and tax planning strategies 
we review the valuation allowance quarterly and maintain it until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal 
because evidence such as our historical operating results during the most recent years is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  our cumulative loss during the three year period ended december  represents sufficient negative evidence regarding the need for a full valuation allowance under asc we will release this valuation allowance when management determines that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
we may be required to release all or a portion of this valuation allowance in the next months  although the exact timing and the portion of the valuation allowance released are subject to the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve for the year and our visibility into future period results 
we expect that the release of the valuation allowance will be recorded as an income tax benefit at the time of release  significantly increasing our reported net income  thus  significantly reducing our effective tax rate and likely resulting in a negative effective tax rate 
however  we expect our effective tax rate to increase in subsequent periods following any significant release of the valuation allowance 
our net income and effective tax rate will be negatively affected in periods following the release 
however  any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes 
we also estimate our effective income tax rate quarterly  considering all known factors and the estimated effects of future events or tax planning strategies that can cause that rate to vary from the statutory rate 
estimating the outcome of future events is inherently uncertain and final resolution of those events can cause the effective rate to vary significantly 
in addition  changes in us or foreign tax laws or rulings may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
a tax position is a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions shall be recognized only when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position will be sustained 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold should be measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
whether the more likely than not recognition threshold is met for a tax position  is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 
tax positions are not permitted to be recognized  derecognized  or remeasured due to changes subsequent to the balance sheet date  but prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
rather  these changes are recorded in the period the change occurs with appropriate disclosure of such subsequent events  if significant 
the company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
in situations where the company has tax deductions that would otherwise increase a deferred tax asset related to net operating losses  a tax deduction which is treated as an uncertain tax position is recorded as a reduction of the deferred tax asset on the balance sheet 
in this regard  although the uncertain tax position was not reflected as an unrecognized tax benefit in the balance sheet as a recorded liability  it is disclosed in the tabular rollforward for unrecognized tax benefits in the notes to the financial statements 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to products and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable and reasonably possible losses 
a determination of the amount of liability to be recorded  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
it is reasonably possible that the company could incur losses in excess of the amounts accrued 
although this amount cannot be estimated  we believe that any additional losses would not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the tax sharing agreement  as further discussed in note tax and indemnification liabilities transferred from trane to wabco  in notes to the consolidated financial statements  wabco is responsible for certain tax and indemnification liabilities 
these liabilities include indemnification liabilities to trane of million 
cyclical and seasonal nature of business the industry in which we operate is cyclical 
approximately of our sales are for newly manufactured trucks  buses and trailers  the production of which follows long investment cycles and are impacted by macro economic factors and 
table of contents legislation 
global commercial vehicle production was consistently growing since in the fourth quarter of  however  the global commercial vehicle markets started to experience a significant decline that was unprecedented in its breadth  depth and speed which continued through all markets experienced favorable growth in while our most developed markets again experienced favorable growth in saw most markets decline with only our markets in north america and japan experiencing growth 
our markets are difficult to predict  however  in we are anticipating mixed markets with a few estimated to grow and others anticipated to be flat to down versus the continued adoption of new technologies by truck and bus manufacturers helps our business outperform the rate of truck and bus production over the longer term 
the commercial vehicle industry is not subject to material seasonal impacts 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
all of those risks are closely monitored 
foreign currency exchange rates we conduct operations through controlled subsidiaries in most of the major countries of western europe  brazil  poland  china  south korea  india and japan as well as the us 
in addition  we conduct business in many countries through cross border sales and purchases  affiliated companies and partnerships in which we own or less of the stock or partnership interest 
as our financial statements are presented in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations  especially for the countries and currencies referred to above 
applying a value at risk var methodology to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  across the translational  cash flow and balance sheet exposures for the year  the potential maximum loss in earnings is estimated to be million which is based on a year horizon and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors or our ability to pass on foreign exchange effects to commercial counterparties 
interest rate sensitivity all of the company financial debt and investments are based on floating rates 
even material moves of the interest rates  based on the weighted average of net outstanding interest bearing debt in  would have an immaterial effect on our earnings 
commodity exposures we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of base metals and steel  mainly through contractual agreements with component suppliers 
applying a var methodology to this exposure  the potential maximum loss in earnings is estimated to be million which is based on a year horizon and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors or our ability to pass on effects to commercial counterparties
