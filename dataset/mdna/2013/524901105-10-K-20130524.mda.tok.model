item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates intangible assets and goodwill 
our deferred tax assets may not be fully realizable as of march   we had approximately million in us federal deferred tax assets  which represent tax benefits that we expect to realize in future periods 
under accounting rules  we are required to recognize a charge to earnings to reduce our deferred tax assets if it is determined that any future tax benefits are not likely to be realized before they expire 
deferred tax assets generated in us jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire years after they are generated 
those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire years after they are generated 
in order to realize these future tax benefits  we estimate that we must generate approximately billion in future us earnings  approximately million of which must be in the form of foreign source income  before the benefits expire 
there can be no assurances that we will achieve this level of earnings before some portion of these tax benefits expires 
in addition  our belief that we will likely be able to realize these future tax benefits is based in part upon our estimates of the timing of other differences in revenue and expense recognition between tax returns and financial statements and our understanding of the application of tax regulations  which may prove to be incorrect for any number of reasons  including future changes in tax or accounting regulations 
if we are required to recognize a charge to earnings to reduce our deferred tax assets  the charge may be material to our earnings or financial condition 
we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations our asset managers operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states on behalf of international clients 
we have offices in numerous countries and many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states 
our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of various foreign jurisdictions  expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks  expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences which  among other things  make it more difficult to repatriate to the united states the cash that we generate outside the us at march   our total cash and cash equivalents of million included approximately million held by our foreign subsidiaries  some of which  if repatriated  may be subject to material tax effects 
furthermore  despite controls and other actions reasonably designed to mitigate these risks  our international operations expose us to risks arising from legg mason potential responsibility for actions of third party agents and other representatives of our business operating outside our primary jurisdictions of operation 
our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks difficulty in managing  operating and marketing our international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under management and revenues in our us dollar based financial statements  and significant adverse changes in foreign political  economic  legal and regulatory environments 
legal and regulatory risks regulatory matters may negatively affect our business and results of operations our business is subject to regulation by various regulatory authorities that are charged with protecting the interests of our clients 
we could be subject to civil liability  criminal liability  or sanction  including revocation of our subsidiaries registrations as investment advisers  revocation of the licenses of our employees  censures  fines  or temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business  if we violate such laws or regulations 
any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  reputation  and business prospects 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years 
in particular  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant additional costs as a result of regulatory changes affecting us mutual funds and changes to european mutual fund regulation  including the european union directive on undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities directives and the alternative investment fund managers directive 
furthermore  the sec has proposed replacing rule b under the investment company act of  which regulates certain fees that may be paid to mutual fund distributors  with a new regulation that would significantly change fund distribution practices in the industry 
this proposal  if adopted  could increase our operational and compliance costs and may affect our ability to compensate distributors for selling our products 
we also are spending time and money to comply with the requirements of the us foreign account tax compliance act 
our business and results of operations can also be adversely affected by federal  state and foreign regulatory issues and proceedings 
we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations 
for example  we note that the us federal government has made  and has proposed further  significant changes to the regulatory structure of the financial services industry  and we expect to spend time and resources to comply with these regulatory changes 
we also note that recommendations for regulatory reform in the liquidity asset management business include the possible imposition of banking and banking like regulations on liquidity funds and their managers or of ending the stable value characteristic of these funds 
currently  sec and european regulatory officials have stated publicly that they are considering proposing additional regulations for money market funds that are designed to address certain concerns arising from the financial crisis 
among the changes under consideration are a possible requirement that money market funds have a capital buffer  the imposition of redemption holdbacks  and a requirement that money market funds convert to a floating net asset value 
if adopted  these proposals  which also have been publicly supported by a number of banking officials  could significantly impact the money market fund industry 
depending on the nature of any changes adopted  the new regulations could  among other things  reduce the attractiveness of money market funds to retail and institutional investors and raise the costs of being in this business 
we continue to monitor this area carefully and  if new regulations are adopted  we will consider how they affect our liquidity management business and take action  as appropriate 
any of these revisions could adversely affect our liquidity asset management business and our results of operations 
instances of criminal activity and fraud by participants in the asset management industry  disclosures of trading and other abuses by participants in the financial services industry and significant governmental intervention and investment in the financial markets and financial firms have led the us government and regulators to increase the rules and regulations governing  and oversight of  the us financial system 
this activity has resulted in changes to the laws and regulations governing the asset management industry and more aggressive enforcement of the existing laws and regulations 
for example  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the us provides for a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services regulatory environment and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and many regulatory decisions to be implemented 
certain provisions of the dodd frank act will  and other provisions may  require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business  will or may increase regulatory compliance burdens  and may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets 
the ongoing revisions to the laws and regulations governing our business  and their counterparts internationally  are an ongoing process 
the cumulative effect of these actions may result in increased expenses  or lower management or other fees  and therefore adversely affect the revenues or profitability of our business 
our business involves risks of being engaged in litigation and liability that could increase our expenses and reduce our net income many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability 
in the normal course of business  our asset managers are from time to time named as defendants or co defendants in lawsuits  or are involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits  seeking substantial damages 
for example  one of our asset managers was named as the defendant in a lawsuit filed by a former institutional client seeking damages in excess of million 
although we believe the claims are without merit  no assurances can be given that this lawsuit will not adversely impact our expenses or net income 
we are also involved from time to time in governmental and self regulatory organization investigations and proceedings  including the regulatory proceedings discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
similarly  the investment funds that our asset managers manage are subject to actual and threatened lawsuits and governmental and self regulatory organization investigations and proceedings  any of which could harm the investment returns or reputation of the applicable fund or result in our asset managers being liable to the funds for any resulting damages 
there has been an increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the asset management industry in recent years  including customer claims as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages 
any litigation can increase our expenses and reduce our net income 
insurance may not be available on a cost effective basis to protect us from liability we face the inherent risk of liability related to litigation from clients  third party vendors or others and actions taken by regulatory agencies 
to help protect against these potential liabilities  we purchase insurance in amounts  and against risks  that we consider appropriate  where such insurance is available at prices we deem acceptable 
there can be no assurance  however  that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or  if covered  will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage  that any insurer will remain solvent and will meet its obligations to provide us with coverage or that insurance coverage will continue to be available with sufficient limits at a reasonable cost 
insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured  and may increase significantly over relatively short periods 
in addition  certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs 
renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co insurance liability

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of our lease obligations 
item legal proceedings 
our current and former subsidiaries have been the subject of customer complaints and have also been named as defendants in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage  asset management and investment banking activities  including certain class actions  which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages  which could be substantial 
for example  we are aware of litigation against certain underwriters of offerings in which one or more of our former subsidiaries was a participant  but where the former subsidiary is not now a defendant 
in these latter cases  it is possible that we may be called upon to contribute to settlements or judgments 
in the normal course of our business  our current and former subsidiaries have also received subpoenas and are currently involved in governmental and self regulatory agency inquiries  investigations and  from time to time  proceedings involving asset management activities 
in the transaction with citigroup  we transferred to citigroup the subsidiaries that constituted our private client brokerage and capital markets businesses  thus transferring the entities that would have primary liability for most of the customer complaint  litigation and regulatory liabilities and proceedings arising from those businesses 
however  as part of that transaction  we agreed to indemnify citigroup for most customer complaint  litigation and regulatory liabilities of our former private client brokerage and capital markets businesses that result from pre closing events 
in addition  the asset management business we acquired from citigroup is a defendant in a number of legal actions  including class action litigation  arising from pre closing asset management activities  some of which seek substantial damages 
under the terms of the transaction agreement with citigroup  citigroup has agreed to indemnify us for certain legal matters  including all currently known pre closing legal matters  of the former cam business 
while the ultimate resolution of any pre closing matters threatened or pending from our prior brokerage and capital markets businesses or the former cam business cannot be determined at this time  based on current information and after consultation with legal counsel  management believes that any accrual or range of reasonably possible losses as of march  is not material 
while the ultimate resolution of any other threatened or pending litigation and other matters cannot be currently determined  in the opinion of our management  after consultation with legal counsel  due in part to the preliminary nature of certain of these matters  we are currently unable to estimate the amount or range of potential losses from these matters  and our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected during a period in which a matter is ultimately resolved

executive overview legg mason  inc  a holding company  with its subsidiaries which collectively comprise legg mason is a global asset management firm 
acting through our subsidiaries  we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients  company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles 
we offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries 
we have operations principally in the united states of america us and the united kingdom us and also have offices in australia  bahamas  brazil  canada  chile  china  dubai  france  germany  italy  japan  luxembourg  poland  singapore  spain  switzerland and taiwan 
all references to fiscal  or  refer to our fiscal year ended march of that year 
terms such as we  us  our  and company refer to legg mason 
in connection with a realignment of our executive management team during fiscal  we no longer manage our business in two divisions and  during fiscal  eliminated the previous separation of the americas and international divisions and combined them into one operating segment  global asset management 
we believe this structure allows us to function as a global organization with a single purpose 
as a result of this change  we no longer present assets under management aum or revenues by division 
our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees  from separate accounts and funds  and distribution and service fees 
investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage 
in addition  performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
the largest portion of our performance fees is earned based on month performance periods that end in differing quarters during the year  with a portion based on quarterly performance periods 
distribution and service fees are received for distributing investment products and services  or for providing other support services to investment portfolios  and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio 
our revenues  therefore  are dependent upon the level of our aum and fee rates  and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions  our ability to attract and maintain aum and key investment personnel  and investment performance 
our aum primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets as well as market performance 
client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management  and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services  may be based on one or more of a number of factors 
these factors include our reputation in the marketplace  the investment performance both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products of our products and services  the fees we charge for our investment services  the client or potential client situation  including investment objectives  liquidity needs  investment horizon and amount of assets managed  our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment  including market conditions 
the fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product  the amount of assets under management  the asset management affiliate that provides the services  and the type of services and investment objectives that are provided 
fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services 
accordingly  our revenues and average aum advisory revenue yields will be affected by the composition of our aum  with changes in the relative level of equity assets more significantly impacting our revenues and average aum advisory revenue yields 
average aum advisory revenue yields are calculated as the ratio of annualized investment advisory fees  excluding performance fees  to average aum 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we may reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
we have in place revenue sharing agreements with most of our asset management affiliates  under which specified percentages of the affiliates revenues are required to be distributed to us and the balance of the revenues is retained to pay operating expenses  including compensation expenses  but excluding certain expenses and income taxes 
under these agreements  our asset management affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs 
as such  our net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc  operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues  and a change in aum at one affiliate can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another affiliate 
in addition  from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other arrangements with our asset management personnel  which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability 
the most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits  of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels  non compensation related operating expense levels at revenue share based affiliates  and profits 
the next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing expense  which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature 
certain other operating costs are quasi fixed in nature  such as occupancy  depreciation and amortization  and fixed contract commitments for market data  communication and technology services  and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or  conversely  usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity 
our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets  particularly in the united states  but also in the other countries in which we operate 
results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results 
our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the amount and composition of our aum  and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates  among other things 
periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  the diversification of services and products offered  investment performance  access to distribution channels  reputation in the market  attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients 
in the last few years  the industry has seen flows into products for which we do not currently garner significant market share 
in addition  the economic downturn of fiscal and contributed to a significant contraction in our business and we have not recovered to pre downturn levels 
the financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive 
our competition includes numerous global  national  regional and local asset management firms  broker dealers and commercial banks 
the industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty  and in prior years  by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions 
the industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal  state  and foreign laws 
like most firms  we have been impacted by regulatory and legislative changes 
responding to these changes has required  and will continue to require  us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability 
our strategy is focused on four primary areas listed below 
management keeps these strategic priorities in mind when it evaluates our operating performance and financial condition 
consistent with this approach  we have also presented in the table below the most important matters on which management currently focuses in evaluating our performance and financial condition 
strategic priorities recent initiatives product expansion promote revenue growth through new product development  leveraging the capabilities of our affiliates identify and execute strategic acquisitions to increase product offerings and fill gaps in products and services investment performance deliver compelling and consistent performance against both relevant benchmarks and the products and services of our competitors for year  year  year  and year periods distribution focus evaluation and reallocation of resources within and to our distribution platform to continue to build a top distribution function with the capability to offer solutions to relevant investment challenges operating efficiency management of expenses restructuring of affiliate arrangements net loss attributable to legg mason  inc for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income attributable to legg mason  inc of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the current year loss is primarily attributable to million  or per diluted share  of non cash impairment charges related to intangible assets and a million  or per diluted share  non operating charge from the extinguishment of debt 
average aum  and total revenues  remained relatively flat in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year strong overall performance and the improvement of our global distribution function contributed to a continued reduction in outflows 
the modest outflows were mostly offset by increases in aum due to market performance  an acquisition  and new product launches in fiscal the following discussion and analysis provides additional information regarding our financial condition and results of operations 
business environment and results of operations the business environment in fiscal was marked by uneven growth and a continued heightened sensitivity to economic news 
major economic events and news of the year included uneven domestic growth  periodic developments in the ongoing european sovereign debt crisis  the fiscal cliff  sequestration  and the actions of the federal reserve to maintain low interest rates  including beginning a third round of quantitative easing and the continued support of the secondary mortgage market 
these events led to a challenging financial environment  both globally and in the united states 
however  during fiscal most us indices produced positive returns  with record highs in the equity markets in march while the economic outlook has remained more positive than in recent years  the financial environment in which we operate still reflects a heightened level of sensitivity as we move into fiscal all three major us equity market indices  as well as the barclays capital us aggregate bond index and barclays capital global aggregate bond index  increased over the past two fiscal years  as illustrated in the table below change for the year ended march indices dow jones industrial average s p nasdaq composite index barclays capital us aggregate bond index barclays capital global aggregate bond index indices are trademarks of dow jones company  mcgraw hill companies  inc  nasdaq stock market  inc  and barclays capital  respectively  which are not affiliated with legg mason

includes impact of foreign exchange  reinvestment of dividends  and other 
aum at march   was billion  an increase of billion  or  from march  the increase in aum was attributable to market performance and other of billion  including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations of billion  and billion related to the acquisition of fauchier partners management limited fauchier 
these increases were offset in part by net client outflows of billion and dispositions of billion 
the dispositions were in liquidity assets which resulted from the amendment of historical smith barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage 
long term asset classes accounted for the net client outflows  with billion and billion in equity and fixed income outflows  respectively  partially offset by liquidity inflows of billion 
equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at batterymarch financial management  inc batterymarch  royce associates royce  the permal group  ltd 
permal  and legg mason capital management  llc lmcm 
due in part to investment performance issues  we have experienced net annual outflows in our equity asset class since fiscal the majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by western asset management company western asset  including billion in outflows from a single  low fee global sovereign mandate 
we expect to continue to experience outflows from this mandate of approximately million per month during fiscal fixed income outflows were offset in part by inflows at brandywine global investment management  llc brandywine 
we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class in all but two quarters since the fourth quarter of fiscal we generally earn higher fees and profits on equity aum  and outflows in the equity asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc than would outflows in other asset classes 
we experienced liquidity outflows of approximately billion from a sovereign wealth client during the month ended april   however  we do not expect this outflow to have a material impact on our revenues or net income 
our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice  and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice 
institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  changes in our reputation in the marketplace  changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships  loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance

global distribution  which consists of our centralized global distribution operations  principally sells us and international mutual funds and other commingled vehicles  retail separately managed account programs  and sub advisory accounts for insurance companies and similar clients 
affiliate other consists of the distribution operations within our asset managers and principally sells institutional separate accounts and liquidity money market funds 
the component changes in our aum by distribution channel in billions for the year ended march   were as follows global distribution affiliate other total march  net client cash flows  excluding liquidity funds liquidity fund flows  net net client cash flows market performance and other acquisitions dispositions  net march  for the years ended march  and  our overall effective fee rate across all asset classes and distribution channels was and basis points  respectively 
fees for managing equity assets are generally higher  averaging approximately basis points for each of the years ended march  and this compares to fees for managing fixed income assets  which averaged approximately basis points for each of the years ended march  and  and liquidity assets  which averaged under basis points reflecting the impact of current advisory fee waivers due to the low interest rate environment for each of the years ended march  and equity assets are primarily managed by clearbridge  royce  batterymarch  and permal  fixed income assets are primarily managed by western asset and brandywine  and liquidity assets are primarily managed by western asset 
fee rates for assets distributed through legg mason global distribution  which are predominately retail in nature  averaged approximately basis points for each of the years ended march  and  while fee rates for assets distributed through the affiliate other channel averaged approximately basis points for each of the years ended march  and the decline in higher yielding equity assets has impacted our revenues  as further discussed below 
investment performance overall investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended march   was generally positive compared to relevant benchmarks 
for the year ended march   most us indices produced positive returns 
the best performing was the s p mid cap index  returning for the year ended march  these returns were achieved in an economic environment characterized by uneven domestic growth and heightened sensitivity to economic news which included improving unemployment and housing figures  the anticipation and implementation of the sequestration  concerns surrounding the fiscal cliff  and periodic developments in the continuing european sovereign debt crisis 
in the fixed income markets  the federal reserve affirmed its commitment to hold the federal funds rate at historic lows  by beginning a third round of quantitative easing and continuing support of the secondary mortgage market

business model streamlining initiative in may  we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that primarily involved transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships 
the initiative resulted in over million in annual cost savings  substantially all of which are cash savings 
these cost savings consist of i over million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates  and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements  ii approximately million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units  including savings associated with consolidating office space  and iii approximately million from our global distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements 
the initiative involved million in transition related costs that primarily included charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period 
the transition related costs also included charges for consolidating leased office space  early contract terminations  accelerated depreciation of fixed assets  asset disposals and professional fees 
during the years ended march  and  transition related costs totaled million and million  respectively 
all transition related costs were accrued as of the completion of the initiative on march  we achieved total cost savings from the initiative of approximately million and million as of march  and  respectively  when compared to similar expenses prior to the commencement of the streamlining initiative 
a portion of the estimated transition related savings were incremental to fiscal  and are explained  where applicable  in the results of operations discussion to follow 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative 
results of operations in accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation  we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles  the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity clo 
the consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 
we also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments  which is recorded in other non operating income expense  is reflected in our net income loss  net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the consolidation of investment vehicles 
operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended march   were billion  a decrease of from billion in the year ended march   despite average aum remaining essentially flat 
this decrease was primarily due to the impact of a reduction in average aum advisory revenue yields  from basis points in the year ended march   to basis points in the year ended march  the reduction in average aum advisory revenue yields was the result of a less favorable average asset mix  with equity assets  which generally earn higher fees than fixed income and liquidity assets  comprising a lower percentage of our total average aum for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  this decrease was offset in part by a million increase in performance fees 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased million  or  to million 
of this decrease  million was the result of lower average equity assets managed by batterymarch  lmcm and legg mason global equities group lmge  and million was due to the divestiture of an affiliate in february these decreases were offset in part by an increase of million due to higher average fixed income assets managed by brandywine 
investment advisory fees from funds decreased million  or  to billion 
of this decrease  million was due to lower average assets managed by permal  and million was due to lower average equity assets managed by royce  lmcm and lmge 
these decreases were offset in part by a million increase as a result of higher average fixed income assets managed by western asset and brandywine  and a million increase as a result of higher average equity assets at clearbridge 
of our total aum as of march  and  approximately was in accounts that were eligible to earn performance fees 
performance fees increased million to million  primarily due to million of fees received by western asset related to the wind down of its participation in the us treasury public private investment program ppip 
higher fees earned on assets managed at permal and brandywine also contributed to the increase 
distribution and service fees decreased million  or  to million  as the result of the decline in average fee rates received on mutual fund aum subject to distribution and service fees 
operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended march  were billion  an increase of from billion in the prior year 
the increase in total operating expenses was primarily the result of million of intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the current year  as further discussed below 
operating expenses for the years ended march  and incurred at the investment management affiliate level comprised approximately of total operating expenses in each year  excluding the impairment charges  which are deemed to be corporate expenses 
the remaining operating expenses are comprised of corporate and distribution costs 
the components of total compensation and benefits in millions for the years ended march were as follows years ended march  salaries and incentives benefits and payroll taxes transition related costs management transition compensation costs other total compensation and benefits total compensation and benefits increased to billion  salaries and incentives increased million  principally due to an increase of million in incentive based compensation at investment affiliates  primarily resulting from costs associated with the modification of employment and other arrangements  most significantly with the management of permal  and the impact of reductions in other non compensation related operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates  which create an offsetting increase in compensation per the applicable revenue share agreements 
additional salary and incentive costs of million  resulting from market based compensation increases among retained staff and new hires to support on going growth initiatives  also contributed to the increase 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease in corporate salaries primarily due to headcount reductions resulting from our business streamlining initiative 
benefits and payroll taxes increased million  primarily as a result of an increase in non cash amortization expense and other costs associated with certain deferred compensation plans 
transition related costs decreased million  due to the completion of our business streamlining initiative in march management transition compensation costs in the current year were associated with our chief executive officer stepping down in september and the subsequent reorganization of our executive committee 
these costs were primarily comprised of million of cash severance and million of net non cash accelerated vesting of stock based awards 
also included in this line item was million of non cash amortization expense related to retention awards granted to certain executives and key employees 
other compensation and benefits increased million  primarily due to an increase in revenue share based incentive obligations resulting from net market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments  which were offset by corresponding increases in other non operating income expense 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to from in the prior year  due to the impact of reductions in other non compensation related operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates  the impact of the modification of employment and other arrangements  as well as the impact of quasi fixed compensation costs of administrative and distribution personnel which do not typically vary with revenues 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation recorded in the prior year  as well as the impact of lower corporate compensation costs  principally attributable to our business streamlining initiative 
distribution and servicing expenses decreased to million  driven by a million decrease due to a reduction in average aum in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors 
communications and technology expense decreased to million  driven by the impact of million in transition related costs recognized in the prior year  as well as million in cost savings as a result of our business streamlining initiative 
occupancy expense increased to million  primarily due to real estate related charges totaling million  recorded during fiscal related to further space consolidation which will result in savings of approximately million per year  prospectively 
this increase was offset in part by the impact of million of lease reserves recorded in the prior year  as well as the acceleration of million of depreciation in the prior year  both primarily related to certain office space permanently vacated as a part of our business streamlining initiative 
the increase was also offset in part by million in cost savings  also as a result of our business streamlining initiative 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million  primarily due to certain management contracts becoming fully amortized during fiscal impairment of intangible assets was million in the year ended march  the impairment charges relate to our domestic mutual fund contracts asset  permal funds of hedge fund contracts asset  and permal trade name 
the impairment charges resulted from a number of current trends and factors  including i a decrease in near term margin projections  ii an increase in the rate used to discount projected future cash flows primarily due to company specific factors including continued market and regulatory influences  continued stock price uncertainty and the search for a permanent chief executive officer  which was ongoing as of our december   impairment testing date  iii recent outflows and related reductions in assets under management  and iv a reduction in the near term projected growth rates 
these changes resulted in a reduction of the projected cash flows and our overall assessment of fair value of the assets  such that the domestic mutual fund contracts asset  permal funds of hedge funds contracts asset  and permal trade name asset  declined below their carrying values  and accordingly were impaired by million  million  and million  respectively 
see critical accounting policies and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment charges 
other expenses decreased million  or  to million  primarily due to a million reduction in charges for trading errors 
a million decrease in expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds  and the impact of million of transition related costs recognized in the prior year  also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were offset in part by a million increase in litigation related expenses as a result of certain regulatory investigations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these investigations 
a million increase in professional fees  primarily related to initiatives with permal  including the acquisition of fauchier during fiscal  also offset the decrease 
non operating income expense interest income decreased to million  driven by a million decrease due to lower yields earned on investment balances and a million decrease due to lower average investment balances 
interest expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of the refinancing of the convertible senior notes the notes in may other non operating income expense decreased million  to an expense of million  from income of million in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily a result of the million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in connection with the repurchase of the notes in may the impact of an million gain related to an assigned bankruptcy claim  and a million gain on the sale of a small affiliate  both recognized in the prior year  also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were offset in part by a million increase in net market gains on seed capital investments and assets invested for deferred compensation plans  which are offset by corresponding increases in compensation discussed above  as well as a million increase in net market gains on corporate investments in proprietary fund products  which are not offset in compensation 
other non operating income expense of consolidated investment vehicles civs decreased million to an expense of million  from income of million in the prior year  primarily due to net market losses on investments of certain civs  as well as the impact of market gains recognized in the prior year period related to a previously consolidated civ that was redeemed in the prior year 
income tax provision benefit the benefit for income taxes was million compared to a provision of million in the prior year 
in july  the uk finance act was enacted  which reduced the main uk corporate tax rate from to effective april   and from to effective april  in july  the uk finance act was enacted  further reducing the main uk corporate tax rate to effective april  and effective april  the impact of the tax rate changes on certain existing deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of million in the current year 
the prior year also included a similar uk tax benefit of million on the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the impact was more substantial due to the higher level of pre tax income in that fiscal year 
the effective benefit rate was for the year ended march   compared to an effective tax rate of in the prior year 
changes in the uk tax rate impacted the effective tax benefit rate by percentage points in the year ended march   and percentage points in the prior year 
the impact of civs reduced the effective tax benefit rate by and percentage points for the years ended march  and  respectively 
otherwise  the change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to a lower tax benefit associated with the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal  due to the lower statutory rates in the jurisdictions where certain intangible assets were held  partially offset by adjustments to reserves and the impact of certain tax planning initiatives recorded in fiscal net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc net loss attributable to legg mason  inc for the year ended march   totaled million  or per diluted share  compared to net income attributable to legg mason  inc of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the pre tax impairment charges of million million  net of income tax benefits  or per diluted share  recorded in the current year  related to our indefinite life intangible assets  as well as the million pre tax loss million  net of income tax benefits  or per diluted share on debt extinguishment recognized in connection with the repurchase of the notes in may real estate related charges of million also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were offset in part by the impact of transition related costs recorded in the prior year  and the impact of increased cost savings in the current year  both in connection with our business streamlining initiative 
these items were previously discussed above 
supplemental non gaap financial information as supplemental information  we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles non gaap for adjusted income and operating margin  as adjusted that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing our period to period operating performance 
adjusted income decreased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended march   from million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
operating margin  as adjusted  for the years ended march  and  was and  respectively 
operating margin  as adjusted for the year ended march  was reduced by percentage points due to real estate related charges and management transition compensation costs recorded during fiscal adjusted income we define adjusted income as net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc  plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill  and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment  if any 
we also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance  such as intangible asset impairments  the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets  and loss on extinguishment of contingent convertible debt 
we believe that adjusted income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued extinguished contingent convertible debt or made significant acquisitions 
we also believe that adjusted income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business 
adjusted income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability  and therefore  is most readily reconcilable to net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc determined under gaap 
this measure is provided in addition to net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc  but is not a substitute for net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income  of other companies 
further  adjusted income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under gaap 
we consider adjusted income to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies  as an indicator of value  and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not issued extinguished contingent convertible debt or made significant acquisitions 
in calculating adjusted income  we add the impact of the amortization of management contract assets and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets  both of which arise from acquisitions  to net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions 
deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under gaap absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business 
because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization  we add this benefit to net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc in the calculation of adjusted income 
however  because of our net operating loss carry forward  we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time 
conversely  we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and united kingdom tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets  if applicable  that have been recognized under gaap 
we also add back non cash imputed interest and the extinguishment loss on contingent convertible debt adjusted for amounts allocated to the conversion feature  as well as adding the actual tax benefits on the imputed interest that are not realized under gaap 
these adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions  including any related impairments  or issued extinguished contingent convertible debt 
should a disposition  impairment charge or other non core item occur  its impact on adjusted income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm 
accordingly  we monitor these items and their related impact  including taxes  on adjusted income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures 
although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses  we do not add these charges in calculating adjusted income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement 
a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc to adjusted income in thousands except per share amounts is as follows for the years ended march  net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc plus less amortization of intangible assets loss on extinguishment of senior notes impairment of intangible assets deferred income taxes on intangible assets impairment charges tax amortization benefit uk tax rate adjustment imputed interest on convertible debt senior notes adjusted income net income loss per diluted share attributable to legg mason  inc common shareholders plus less amortization of intangible assets loss on extinguishment of senior notes impairment of intangible assets deferred income taxes on intangible assets impairment charges tax amortization benefit uk tax rate adjustment imputed interest on convertible debt senior notes adjusted income per diluted share operating margin  as adjusted we calculate operating margin  as adjusted  by dividing i operating income loss  adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans  the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements  transition related costs of streamlining our business model  income loss of civs  and impairment charges by ii our operating revenues  adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles  less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties  which we refer to as operating revenues  as adjusted 
the compensation items  other than transition related costs  are removed from operating income loss in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in other non operating income expense  and thus have no impact on net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc transition related costs  impairment charges and income loss of civs are removed from operating income loss in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations 
we use operating revenues  as adjusted in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses  which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products  although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period 
operating revenues  as adjusted  also include our advisory revenues we receive from civs that are eliminated in consolidation under gaap 
we believe that operating margin  as adjusted  is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products  transition related costs and impairment charges  and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above 
the consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact on net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc this measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under gaap  but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under gaap and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of adjusted margins of other companies 
the calculation of operating margin and operating margin  as adjusted  is as follows dollars in thousands for the years ended march  operating revenues  gaap basis plus less operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles operating revenues  as adjusted operating income loss  gaap basis plus less gains losses on deferred compensation and seed investments transition related costs impairment of intangible assets operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles operating income  as adjusted operating margin  gaap basis operating margin  as adjusted fiscal compared with fiscal assets under management the components of the changes in our aum in billions for the years ended march were as follows beginning of period investment funds  excluding liquidity funds subscriptions redemptions separate account flows  net liquidity fund flows  net net client cash flows market performance and other dispositions end of period subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes

aum at march   was billion  a decrease of billion  or  from march  the decrease in aum was attributable to net client outflows of billion and dispositions of billion  which were partially offset by market performance and other of billion  including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the majority of dispositions were in liquidity assets  billion  which resulted from the amendment of historical smith barney brokerage programs discussed below 
there were also billion in dispositions from the divestiture of two small affiliates 
long term asset classes accounted for the net client outflows  with billion and billion in equity and fixed income outflows  respectively  partially offset by liquidity inflows of billion 
equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at lmcm  clearbridge  batterymarch and royce 
the majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by western asset  including billion in outflows from a single  low fee global sovereign mandate 
the amendment of certain historical smith barney brokerage programs during the first quarter of fiscal  as previously discussed  resulted in a reduction of billion in liquidity aum during the year ended march  as a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition  the disposition of this liquidity aum resulted in a reduction in operating revenue of million  net of related fee waivers  in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  the disposition of this aum also resulted in reductions in distribution and servicing expenses of million in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  aum by asset class aum by asset class in billions as of march were as follows of total of total change equity fixed income liquidity total the component changes in our aum by asset class in billions for the fiscal year ended march   were as follows equity fixed income liquidity total march  investment funds  excluding liquidity funds subscriptions redemptions separate account flows  net liquidity fund flows  net net client cash flows market performance and other dispositions march  average aum by asset class in billions for the years ended march were as follows of total of total change equity fixed income liquidity total aum by distribution channel the component changes in our aum by distribution channel in billions for the fiscal year ended march   were as follows global distribution affiliate other total march  net client cash flows  excluding liquidity funds liquidity fund flows  net net client cash flows market performance and other dispositions march  for the years ended march  and  our overall effective fee rate across all asset classes and distribution channels was and basis points  respectively 
fees for managing equity assets are generally higher  averaging approximately basis points for each of the years ended march  and this compares to fees for managing fixed income assets  which averaged approximately basis points for each of the years ended march  and  and liquidity assets  which averaged under basis points reflecting the impact of current advisory fee waivers due to the low interest rate environment for each of the years ended march  and fee rates for assets distributed through legg mason global distribution  which are predominately retail in nature  averaged approximately basis points for each of the years ended march  and  while fee rates for assets distributed through the affiliate other channel averaged approximately basis points for each of the years ended march  and the decline in higher yielding equity assets has impacted our revenues  as further discussed below 
investment performance overall investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended march   was generally positive compared to relevant benchmarks 
the equity markets ended a difficult year on a positive note  responding favorably to improving unemployment figures  the conclusion of bank stress tests resulting in certain banks increasing dividends  and reduced fears of a european debt fallout 
as a result  most us indices produced positive returns for our fiscal the most notable was the nasdaq composite returning for the year ended march  in the fixed income markets  improved economic data suggested that the recovery was strengthening 
flights to safety ebbed as the european debt crisis eased allowing us treasury rates to climb from historically low levels

results of operations operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended march   were billion  a decrease of from billion in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in average aum and a million decrease in performance fees 
this decrease was offset in part by an increase in average aum revenue yields  from basis points in the year ended march   to basis points in the year ended march   resulting from a more favorable average asset mix 
the disposition of liquidity aum related to the morgan stanley wealth management mswm relationship resulted in a reduction in operating revenues of million  net of related fee waivers  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased million  or  to million 
of this decrease  million was primarily the result of lower average equity assets managed by lmcm  batterymarch  clearbridge and legg mason investment counsel trust company lmic  and million was primarily due to the divestiture of a singapore based asset manager in fiscal these decreases were offset in part by an increase of million due to higher average fixed income assets managed by brandywine 
investment advisory fees from funds remained essentially flat at billion for both periods 
higher average equity assets managed by royce and clearbridge  and higher average fixed income assets  primarily managed at western asset  resulted in an increase of million and million  respectively 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million  net of related fee waivers  due to lower average liquidity assets managed at western asset  primarily as a result of the previously discussed disposition of liquidity aum related to our mswm relationship  as well as a million decrease as a result of lower average equity assets managed by lmcm and permal 
of our total aum as of march  and  approximately for each period was in accounts that were eligible to earn performance fees

the components of total compensation and benefits in millions for the years ended march were as follows years ended march  salaries and incentives benefits and payroll taxes transition related costs other total compensation and benefits total compensation and benefits decreased to billion  salaries and incentives decreased million  primarily due to a million decrease in corporate salaries and incentives  primarily resulting from headcount reductions in connection with our business streamlining initiative  and a million net decrease in salaries and incentives at revenue share based affiliates 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in incentives of million resulting from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with western asset  as well as additional costs of million associated with market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees  primarily in our global distribution group  to support on going growth initiatives 
benefits and payroll taxes increased million  primarily due to an million increase in non cash amortization expense associated with certain deferred compensation awards at revenue share based affiliates 
this increase was offset in part by a million decrease in corporate benefits expense  primarily due to headcount reductions resulting from our business streamlining initiative 
transition related costs decreased million 
these costs represent accruals for severance and retention costs related to our business streamlining initiative 
other compensation and benefits decreased million  primarily due to a decrease in revenue share based incentive obligations resulting from net market losses on assets invested for seed capital investments and deferred compensation plans  which were offset by corresponding increases in other non operating income expense 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to from in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the impact of the change in the expense reimbursement arrangement with western asset  as well as market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of lower corporate compensation costs  primarily attributable to our business streamlining initiative  the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments  and the decrease in transition related compensation 
distribution and servicing expenses decreased to million  principally driven by a million decrease due to the previously discussed disposition of liquidity aum related to the mswm relationship  as well as a million decrease in servicing expenses as a result of our business streamlining initiative 
a million decline in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches also contributed to the decrease 
communications and technology expense increased to million  driven by increases  principally in data processing costs  market data costs  and consulting fees  totaling million  primarily due to transition related costs incurred as a result of our business streamlining initiative 
these increases were offset in part by million in cost savings as a result of our streamlining changes  including reduced depreciation of technology hardware and software and consulting fees 
occupancy expense increased to million  primarily due to a million net increase in lease reserves recorded in fiscal  primarily related to permanently abandoning certain office space as part of our business streamlining initiative 
in addition  there was a million increase as a result of the acceleration of depreciation related to space permanently abandoned in fiscal  also related to our business streamlining initiative 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of the write off of a million real estate escrow deposit in the prior year and a million reduction in depreciation on furniture and leasehold improvements  both resulting from our business streamlining initiative 
amortization of intangibles decreased to million  primarily due to the full amortization of certain management contracts during fiscal other expenses increased million  or  to million  primarily as a result of an increase in expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds during the current year under expense cap arrangements 
non operating income expense interest income increased to million  driven by higher yields earned on investment balances 
interest expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of the retirement of our equity units during fiscal  which reduced interest expense by million 
other non operating income decreased million to million  primarily as a result of million in net market losses on investments in proprietary fund products  which were partially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above  and million due to reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans  which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases described above 
these decreases were offset in part by an million increase in dividend income  which was partially offset by a corresponding compensation increase under revenue sharing agreements  a gain of million related to an assigned bankruptcy claim  and a gain of million on the sale of a small affiliate 
other non operating income of civs increased million to million  due to net market gains on investments of certain civs 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million compared to million in the prior year 
during fiscal  the uk finance act the act was enacted 
the act reduced the main uk corporate income tax rate from to effective april   and to effective april  the impact of the tax rate changes on the revaluation of certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of million in the current year 
the prior year also included a similar tax benefit of million on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities 
in addition  the restructuring of our australian business  partially offset by adjustments to the net value of certain deferred tax assets  resulted in a net tax benefit of million in the current year 
the effective tax rate was compared to in the prior year 
changes in the uk tax rate impacted the effective tax rate by and percentage points in the years ended march  and  respectively 
in addition  the restructuring of our australian business  partially offset by adjustments to the net value of certain deferred tax assets  impacted the effective tax rate by percentage points in the current year 
net income attributable to legg mason  inc net income attributable to legg mason  inc for the year ended march   totaled million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
the decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with western asset  the impact of net market losses on proprietary fund products and assets invested for deferred compensation plans which are not offset in compensation and benefits  and the net impact of decreased operating revenues 
these decreases were offset in part by the impact of cost savings due to our business streamlining initiative  and the impact of tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary and uk tax rate changes 
these items were previously discussed in results of operations above 
supplemental non gaap financial information adjusted income decreased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended march   from million  or per diluted share  in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in net income  previously discussed  excluding the impact of uk tax rate adjustments 
operating margin  as adjusted  for the years ended march  and  was and  respectively

liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations 
our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses 
we intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business 
these opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require  among other things  and  subject to existing covenants  the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt 
the consolidation of variable interest entities discussed above does not impact our liquidity and capital resources 
we have no rights to the benefits from  nor do we bear the risks associated with  the assets and liabilities of the civs beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles  which are eliminated in consolidation 
additionally  creditors of the civs have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment  if any  so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations 
our assets consist primarily of intangible assets  goodwill  cash and cash equivalents  investment securities  and investment advisory and related fee receivables 
our assets have been principally funded by equity capital  long term debt and the results of our operations 
at march   our cash and cash equivalents  total assets  long term debt and stockholders equity were billion  billion  billion and billion  respectively 
total assets and total liabilities of the civs at march   were million and million  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in liquid domestic and non domestic money market funds that hold principally domestic and non domestic bank time deposits  bank and corporate commercial paper and bonds  and government and agency securities 
we have not recognized any losses on these investments 
our monitoring of cash and cash equivalents mitigates the potential that material risks may be associated with these balances 
the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended march in millions cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of period cash and cash equivalents  end of period cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal were million  primarily related to net sales of trading and other current investments and results of operations  adjusted for non cash items  offset in part by the allocation of extinguished debt repayment and payments for accrued compensation 
cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal  were million  primarily related to payments related to the acquisition of fauchier and payments made for fixed assets  offset in part by net activity related to civs 
cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal were million  primarily related to the repayment of long term debt of  million  the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million  the million repayment of short term debt  and dividends paid of million  offset in part by the proceeds from the subsequent long term debt issuances of  million 
cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal were million  primarily related to net income  adjusted for non cash items 
cash inflows provided by investing activities during fiscal  were million  primarily related to million of net activity related to civs and a release of restricted cash required for market hedge arrangements  offset in part by payments made for fixed assets 
cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal  were million  primarily due to the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million and dividends paid of million 
cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal were million  primarily attributable to net income  adjusted for non cash items 
cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal were million  primarily attributable to payments made for fixed assets 
cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal were million  primarily attributable to the repurchase of million of our common shares for million 
financing transactions the table below reflects our primary sources of financing in thousands as of march  total at march  amount outstanding at march  type interest rate maturity senior notes n a may five year amortizing term loan n a libor june revolving credit agreement n a libor annual commitment fee june convertible senior notes repurchased june previous revolving credit agreement libor terminated june during january  we increased our capital base by billion through the sale of convertible senior notes 
the proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that was used for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of structured investment vehicle securities from our liquidity funds 
the notes were repurchased in may  as further discussed below 
prior to the repurchase of the notes  we were accreting the carrying value of the notes to the principal amount at maturity using an interest rate of the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance over its expected life of seven years  resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal  and  of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in connection with this financing  we entered into economic hedge transactions that increased the effective conversion price of the notes 
these hedge transactions had a net cost to us of million  which we paid from the proceeds of the notes 
these transactions closed on january  capital plan in may  we announced a capital plan that included refinancing the notes 
the refinancing was effected through the issuance of million of senior notes  the net proceeds of which  together with cash on hand and million of remaining borrowing capacity under a then existing revolving credit facility  were used to repurchase all billion of the notes 
the terms of the repurchase included the repayment of the notes at par plus accrued interest  a prepayment fee of million  and the issuance of warrants to the holders of the notes 
the warrants provide for the purchase  in the aggregate and subject to adjustment  of million shares of our common stock  on a net share settled basis  at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire in june and can be settled  at our election  in either shares of common stock or cash 
also pursuant to the capital plan  in june  we entered into an unsecured credit agreement which provides for an undrawn million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to repay the million of outstanding borrowings under the previous revolving credit facility  which was then terminated 
the million revolving credit facility may be increased by an aggregate amount up to million  subject to the approval of the lenders  and expires june this revolving credit facility is available to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of march  the million term loan entered into in conjunction with the unsecured credit agreement noted above can be repaid at any time and is due in four annual installments of million  beginning in june  with the remainder to be repaid at maturity in june the million senior notes are due may and were sold at a discount of million  which is being amortized to interest expense over the seven year term 
in connection with the extinguishment of the notes  the hedge transactions purchased call options and warrants executed in connection with the initial issuance of the notes were also terminated 
the financial covenants under our bank agreements include maximum net debt to ebitda ratio of to and minimum ebitda to interest expense ratio of to debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money  excluding non recourse debt of civs  and capital leases 
under these net debt covenants  our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or million 
ebitda is defined as consolidated net income loss plus minus tax expense benefit  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangibles  any extraordinary expense or losses  and any non cash charges  as defined in the agreements 
as of march   our net debt to ebitda ratio was to and ebitda to interest expense ratio was to  and  therefore  we have maintained compliance with the applicable covenants 
in addition  the senior notes are subject to certain nonfinancial covenants  including provisions relating to dispositions of certain assets  which could require a percentage of any related proceeds to be applied to accelerated repayments 
if our net income loss significantly declines  or if we spend our available cash  it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants 
if we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure  we may elect to take a number of actions  including reducing our expenses in order to increase our ebitda  using available cash to repay all or a portion of our outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt 
we anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt  should it be necessary 
using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above 
entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments 
our outstanding bank debt agreement is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies 
the interest rate and annual commitment fee on our revolving line of credit is based on the higher credit rating of the two rating agencies 
in june  our rating by one of these agencies was downgraded one notch below the other 
should the other agency downgrade our rating  absent an upgrade from the former agency  our interest costs will rise modestly 
in addition  under the terms of the senior notes  the interest rate paid on these notes will increase modestly if our credit ratings are reduced below investment grade 
also in connection with the capital plan  our board of directors authorized billion for additional purchases of our common stock  million of which remained available as of march   and the completion of the purchase of the then remaining million of our common stock previously authorized  which occurred in the quarter ended june  the capital plan authorizes using up to of cash generated from future operations  beginning in fiscal  to purchase shares of our common stock 
other transactions on march   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of fauchier  a leading european based manager of funds of hedge funds  from bnp paribas investment partners  sa the transaction included an initial cash payment of million  which was funded from existing cash resources 
in addition  contingent consideration of up to approximately million and approximately million  utilizing exchange rates as of march   may be due on the second and fourth anniversaries of closing  respectively  dependent on achieving certain financial targets and subject to a catch up adjustment 
the contingent consideration liability had an acquisition date fair value of approximately million 
in may  we terminated the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of legg mason canada inc  in accordance with its terms 
in this transaction  million shares  representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares  were exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes 
certain affiliates are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies 
all such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements during the periods presented 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the fauchier acquisition and our capital plan  respectively 
future outlook we expect that over the next months cash generated from our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating and investing cash needs  and planned share repurchases 
we currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities  including  but not limited to  seed capital investments in new products  repurchase of shares of our common stock  acquisitions  repayment of outstanding debt  or payment of increased dividends 
as described above  we currently project that our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
as of march   we had over million in cash and cash equivalents in excess of our working capital requirements 
as previously discussed  and in accordance with our capital plan  we intend to utilize up to of cash generated from future operations to purchase shares of our common stock 
we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next months 
however  there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect  events may occur that require additional liquidity  such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness  or market conditions might significantly worsen  affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash 
if these events result in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs  we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases  additional cost cutting  reducing our expected expenditures on investments  selling assets such as investment securities  repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries  or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees 
should these types of actions prove insufficient  or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise  we may seek to raise additional equity or debt 
at march   our total cash and cash equivalents of million included million held by foreign subsidiaries 
some of the amounts held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to material repatriation tax effects 
during the year ended march   we repatriated approximately million of foreign cash and we plan to repatriate up to another million over the next several years  in order to increase our cash available in the us for general corporate purposes 
we anticipate an incremental tax cost of approximately million with respect to this repatriation and have adjusted our tax reserve accordingly 
no further repatriation of accumulated prior period foreign earnings is currently planned 
however  if circumstances change  we will provide for and pay any applicable additional us taxes in connection with repatriation of these funds 
it is not practical at this time to determine the income tax liability that would result from any further repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings 
credit and liquidity risk cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a number of high quality financial institutions or funds and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions 
the balances with these financial institutions or funds and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation  such as certain contingent obligations  certain guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity  certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support 
disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
we generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements  as defined  other than those described in the contractual obligation section that follows and consolidation discussed in critical accounting policies and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual and contingent obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments  principally in connection with our long term debt  non cancelable lease agreements  acquisition agreements and service agreements 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments 
the following table sets forth these contractual obligations in millions by fiscal year  and excludes contractual obligations of civs  as we are not responsible or liable for these obligations thereafter total contractual obligations long term borrowings by contract maturity interest on long term borrowings and credit facility commitment fees minimum rental and service commitments total contractual obligations contingent obligation payments related to business acquisition total contractual and contingent obligations excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated clo of million and interest on these long term borrowings  as applicable 
the amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable  using exchange rates as of march   at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreement 
the contingent obligation had an acquisition date fair value of million 
the table above does not include approximately million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which legg mason is a limited partner 
these obligations will be funded  as required  through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal the table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of million net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities  because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated 
the table above does not include redeemable noncontrolling interests  primarily related to civs  of million  because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated 
the table above excludes commitments arising from any potential awards under the proposed permal management equity plan for its key employees 
market risk we maintain an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of legg mason and its subsidiaries 
under the program  certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level 
the following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk 
revenues and net income loss the majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our aum 
accordingly  a decline in the value of the underlying securities will cause our aum  and thus our revenues  to decrease 
in addition  our fixed income and liquidity aum are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts 
in the ordinary course of our business  we may also reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks  and strong markets tend to increase these fees 
declines in market values of aum will result in reduced fee revenues and net income 
we generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets 
declines in market values of aum in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues 
in addition  under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
our net income loss  profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues  and a change in aum at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary 
trading and non trading assets our trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities  including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products  limited partnerships  limited liability companies and certain other investment products 
trading and other current investments  excluding civs  at march  and  subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in thousands below 
investment securities  excluding civs trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans trading proprietary fund products and other investments equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans  proprietary fund products and other investments total current investments  excluding civs approximately million and million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income loss or liquidity 
however  it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income expense 
trading and other current investments of million and million at march  and  respectively  relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions 
therefore  fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense  non operating income expense and net income loss 
approximately million and million of trading and other current investments at march  and  respectively  are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income expense 
of these amounts  the fluctuations in market value of approximately million and million of proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements 
the fluctuations in market value of approximately million and million in proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  are substantially offset by gains losses on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated before the related fund establishes a track record  has other investors  or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy 
non trading assets  excluding civs  at march  and  subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in thousands below 
investment securities  excluding civs available for sale investments in partnerships  llcs and other equity method investments in partnerships and llcs other investments total non trading assets  excluding civs equity method investments in partnerships and llcs at march   included approximately million of investments related to our involvement with the ppip 
fluctuations in the market value of these investments had offsetting compensation expense under revenue sharing agreements 
our investments related to the ppip were fully redeemed during fiscal  upon liquidation of the fund 
investment securities of civs totaled million and million as of march  and  respectively  and investments of civs totaled million and million as of march  and  respectively 
as of march  and  we held equity investments in the civs of million and million  respectively 
fluctuations in the market value of investments of civs in excess of our equity investment will not impact net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc however  it may have an impact on other non operating income expense of civs with a corresponding offset in net income loss attributable to non controlling interests 
valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within critical accounting policies under the heading valuation of financial instruments 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives 
the following is a summary of the effect of a increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at march  carrying value fair value assuming a increase fair value assuming a decrease investment securities  excluding civs trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans trading proprietary fund products and other investments equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans  proprietary fund products and other investments total current investments  excluding civs investments in civs available for sale investments investments in partnerships  llcs and other equity method investments in partnerships and llcs other investments total investments subject to market risk gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability 
in addition  investments in proprietary fund products of approximately million have been economically hedged to limit market risk 
as a result  a increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of march  also  as of march  and  cash and cash equivalents included million and million  respectively  of money market funds 
foreign exchange sensitivity we operate primarily in the united states  but provide services  earn revenues and incur expenses outside the united states 
accordingly  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies  principally in the united kingdom  brazil  japan  canada  singapore  australia  and those denominated in the euro  may impact our comprehensive income loss and net income loss 
certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations 
we do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income loss or liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is partially mitigated as our million of senior notes are at fixed interest rates 
at march   approximately million of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income loss and net income loss 
as of march   we estimate that a change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
understanding these policies  therefore  is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information 
certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
therefore  actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments 
consolidation effective april   we adopted revised accounting guidance  accounting standards codification asc topic  consolidation  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendments to financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r sfas no 
 relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies which includes a new approach for determining who should consolidate a vie  changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a vie  and changes in the assessment of which entities are vies 
the application of the revised accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds  including money market funds 
investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance  financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
in the normal course of our business  we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles 
certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be vies while others are considered to be voting rights entities vres subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights 
for our services  we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible  under certain circumstances  to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees 
our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees 
uncollected management fees from these vies were not material at march  we have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these vies  vres or their investors 
investment vehicles that are considered vres are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle  absent substantive investor rights to replace the manager of the entity kick out rights 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r accounting standards update  amendments to statement for certain investment funds for most sponsored investment funds  including money market funds  we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie if we absorb a majority of the vie expected losses  or receive a majority of the vie expected residual returns  if any 
our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker if certain criteria are met 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders  economic participation of all parties  including how fees are earned and paid to us  related party ownership  guarantees and implied relationships 
in determining the primary beneficiary  we must make assumptions and estimates about  among other things  the future performance of the underlying assets held by the vie  including investment returns  cash flows  and credit and interest rate risks 
in determining whether a vie is significant for disclosure purposes  we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting standards codification topic  consolidation we sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities cdos and clos that do not qualify for the deferral  and are assessed under the revised accounting guidance  as follows 
we determine whether we have a variable interest in a vie by considering if  among other things  we have the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that are expected to be significant to the vie 
we consider the management fee structure  including the seniority level of our fees  the current and expected economic performance of the entity  as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return 
if we have a significant variable interest  we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie if we have both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that potentially could be significant to the vie 
in evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that could potentially be significant to the vie  we consider factors regarding the design  terms  and characteristics of the investment vehicles  including the following qualitative factors if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services  if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle  if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle  if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle  and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is more than insignificant 
legg mason must consolidate any vie for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of civs and other vies 
revenue recognition the vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our aum 
the underlying securities within the portfolios we manage  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements  are generally valued as follows i with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available  the market value of such securities  and ii with respect to other securities and assets  fair value as determined in good faith 
for most of our mutual funds and other pooled products  their boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities 
each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which  in turn  may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services  the fund accounting agent  the fund manager  broker dealers  and others or a combination thereof 
the funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate 
management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
as manager and advisor for separate accounts  we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts or may share this responsibility with others and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account aum 
separate account customers typically select the custodian 
valuation processes for aum are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients 
equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade 
debt securities under management are usually valued at bid  or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices  provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations  quotations from bond dealers  market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities 
short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost  which is designed to approximate fair value 
the vast majority of our aum is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services  fund accounting agents  custodians and brokers 
this varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class 
regardless of the valuation process or pricing source  we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided 
where market prices are not readily available  or are determined not to reflect fair value  value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on  among other things  unobservable inputs 
management fees on aum where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material 
as of march   equity  fixed income and liquidity aum values aggregated billion  billion and billion  respectively 
as the vast majority of our aum is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs  we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying the value of our aum 
economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility  however  the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations 
as of march   less than of total aum is valued based on unobservable inputs 
valuation of financial instruments substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  except our long term debt 
trading investments  investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets include forms of financial instruments 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income loss or other comprehensive income loss  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
for equity investments where we do not control the investee  and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee  we follow the equity method of accounting 
the evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of an investee requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment 
factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights  any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee  the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity 
substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value 
therefore  under the equity method of accounting  our share of the investee underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee 
our share of the investee net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain loss on investments within non operating income expense 
for investments  we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations  when available 
fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices 
we evaluate our non trading investment securities for other than temporary impairment 
impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time 
if an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist  the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry 
as of march  and  excluding investments in civs  we owned approximately million and million  respectively  of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs 
at march  and  we also have approximately million and million  respectively  of other investments  such as investment partnerships  that are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets  of which approximately million and million  respectively  are accounted for under the equity method 
the remainder is accounted for under the cost method  which considers if factors indicate there may be an impairment in the value of these investments 
in addition  as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  of equity method investments that are included in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
the accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
a fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  and the risk of non performance 
the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories level financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets  which  for us  include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets 
level financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or prices are based on observable inputs  other than quoted prices  such as models or other valuation methodologies 
for us  this category may include repurchase agreements  fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products 
this category also includes clo loans and derivative liabilities of a civ 
level financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs  including those for which there is little or no market activity 
this category includes investments in partnerships  limited liability companies  private equity funds and clo debt of a civ 
this category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions 
the valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
proprietary fund products and certain investments held by civs are valued at net asset value nav determined by the fund administrator 
these funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices 
their valuations may be classified as level  level or level based on whether the fund is exchange traded  the frequency of the related nav determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities private equity and investment partnerships for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available  including certain investments held by civs  management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value 
these valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require management judgment and are therefore classified in level the fair values of clo loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as level legg mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided 
the fair value of clo debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology 
inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the clo underlying collateral assets 
given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement  the clo debt valuation is classified as level exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale  the last offering price 
options traded over the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations 
options are classified as level futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as level index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps previously held were valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and classified as level as a practical expedient  we rely on the navs of certain investments as their fair value 
the navs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date 
as of march   approximately of total assets of financial assets measured at fair value and of total liabilities meet the definition of level excluding the assets and liabilities of civs  approximately of total assets of financial assets measured at fair value and no liabilities meet the definition of level any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
intangible assets and goodwill balances as of march   are as follows in thousands amortizable asset management contracts indefinite life intangible assets trade names goodwill our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts  contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds  and trade names resulting from acquisitions 
asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract 
contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost 
similarly  trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
in allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired 
we determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows  which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins  growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience  estimated contract lives  discount rates  projected net client flows and market performance 
the determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed 
the discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset  as more fully described below 
goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities 
given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements  on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values 
triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business  legal or regulatory environment  loss of key personnel  significant business dispositions  or other events  including changes in economic arrangements with our affiliates that will impact future operating results 
if a triggering event has occurred  we perform tests  which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions  to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired 
at a minimum  we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at december we performed an impairment test of the permal funds of hedge funds contracts indefinite life intangible asset as of december   because a modification of our employment contracts and other arrangements with the management of permal that was completed on that day constituted a triggering event 
our test indicated that the funds of hedge funds contracts asset was impaired  thereby triggering impairment tests of our other indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill 
as a result of these impairment tests  updated through our annual test date of december   our permal funds of hedge funds contracts and trade name indefinite life intangible assets and our domestic mutual fund contracts indefinite life intangible assets were each determined to be partially impaired  resulting in aggregate pre tax operating charges of million 
neither goodwill nor any other intangible assets were deemed to be impaired 
details of our intangible assets and goodwill and the related impairment tests follow 
no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended march   as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values 
we also determined that no triggering events had occurred as of march   therefore  no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary 
amortizable intangible assets intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts 
projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current aum for the applicable contracts 
contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset 
the remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates 
if the amortization periods are not appropriate  the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
the estimated remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from one to six years with a weighted average life of approximately years 
indefinite life intangible assets for intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite  fair value is determined from a market participant perspective based on projected discounted cash flows  taking into account the values market participants would pay in a taxable transaction to acquire the respective assets 
we have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets proprietary fund contracts and  to a lesser extent  trade names 
we determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows  which take into consideration estimates of future fees  profit margins  growth rates  taxes  and discount rates 
an asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset 
the determination of the fair values of our indefinite life intangible assets is highly dependent on these estimates and changes in these inputs could result in a material impairment of the related carrying values 
if an asset is impaired  the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to exist 
contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit  such as contracts within the same family of funds  are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions 
similarly  cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset 
projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward years  assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance 
to estimate the projected cash flows  projected growth rates by affiliate are used to project their assets under management 
cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both aum flows and market expectations by asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity and by investment manager based upon  among other things  historical experience and expectations of future market and investment performance from internal and external sources 
currently  our market growth assumptions are for equity  for fixed income  and for liquidity products  with a general assumption of organic growth for all products  subject to exceptions for organic growth in near term periods 
the starting point for these assumptions is our corporate planning process that includes three year aum projections from the management of each operating affiliate that consider the specific business circumstances of each affiliate  with near year flow assumptions for certain affiliates adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect a market participant view 
beyond year three  the estimates move towards our general organic growth assumption of  as appropriate for each affiliate and asset class  through year the resulting cash flow growth rate for year is held constant and used to further project cash flows through year based on projected aum by affiliate and asset class  affiliate advisory fee rates are applied to determine projected revenues 
the domestic mutual fund contracts projected revenues are applied to a weighted average margin for the applicable affiliates that manage the aum 
margins are based on arrangements currently in place at each affiliate 
projected operating income is further reduced by an appropriate tax rate to calculate the projected cash flows 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources  although our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
our assumptions are also subject to change due to  among other factors  poor investment performance by one or more of our advisory affiliates  the withdrawal of aum by clients  changes in business climate  adverse regulatory actions  or loss of key personnel 
we consider these risks in the development of our growth assumptions and discount rates  discussed further below 
further  actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
our process includes comparison of actual results to prior growth projections 
however  differences between actual results and our prior projections are not necessarily indicative of a need to reassess our estimates given that our discounted projected cash flow analyses include projections well beyond three years and variances in the near years may be offset in subsequent years  fair value assessments are point in time  and the consistency of a fair value assessment with other indicators of value that reflect expectations of market participants at that point in time is critical evidence of the soundness of the estimate of value 
in subsequent periods  we consider the differences in actual results from our prior projections in considering the reasonableness of the growth assumptions used in our current impairment testing 
discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and equity capital using a market participant perspective 
we estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates 
we estimate the cost of equity capital based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  peer group betas  and company and equity risk premiums 
the equity risk is further adjusted to consider the relative risk associated with each legg mason indefinite life intangible asset and our reporting unit 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values 
continued market uncertainty and the resulting impact on legg mason stock price and our search for a permanent ceo  which was ongoing during our impairment testing process  increase the relative risk associated with all aspects of our business  resulting in higher discount rates in the current year for our evaluation of each of legg mason indefinite life intangible assets and the reporting unit 
consistent with standard valuation practices for taxable transactions  the projected discounted cash flow analysis also factors in a tax benefit value 
this tax benefit represents the discounted tax savings a third party that purchased an asset on a given valuation date would receive from future tax deductions for the amortization of the purchase price over years 
the permal funds of hedge funds contracts of million account for approximately of our indefinite life intangible assets 
as noted above  the modification of employment contracts and other arrangements with the management of permal constituted a triggering event as of december  further  permal has experienced recent outflows and increased risk associated with its business 
the past several years have seen declines in the traditional high net worth client fund of hedge funds business  permal historical focus  which permal has offset to some extent with new institutional business 
as a result of these factors  actual results generally compare unfavorably to the growth assumptions for the permal funds of hedge funds contracts used in the asset impairment testing at december  and as a result  in our december testing  the near term growth assumptions for these contracts were reduced  which  together with the impact of decreased margins in near years resulting from the modifications of the employment arrangements  led to decreased projected cash flows from the business 
further  fund of hedge fund managers are subject to unique market and regulatory influences  adding additional uncertainty to our estimates 
based upon our projected discounted cash flow analyses  the carrying value of the permal funds of hedge funds contracts asset exceeded its fair value  resulting in impairment charges of million for the excess 
cash flows on the permal funds of hedge funds contracts are assumed to have an average annual growth rate of approximately 
however  given current experience  projected cash flows reflect no net aum flows trending to moderate inflows in years and  respectively 
the projected cash flows from the permal funds of hedge funds contracts are discounted at  reflecting the permal and legg mason specific factors noted above 
investment performance  including its expected impact on future asset flows  is a significant factor in our growth projections for the permal funds of hedge funds contracts 
our market performance projections are supported by the fact that permal two largest funds that comprise over half of the contracts asset aum have year average returns exceeding 
our market projections are further supported by industry statistics 
the domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the citigroup asset management cam transaction of  million account for approximately of our indefinite life intangible assets 
as of december   approximately billion of aum  primarily managed by clearbridge and western asset  are associated with this asset  with approximately in long term fixed income aum and in each of equity aum and liquidity aum 
although our domestic mutual fund contracts overall have maintained strong recent market performance  previously disclosed uncertainties regarding market conditions and asset flows and more recent assessments of related risk  including risks related to potential regulatory changes in the liquidity business  are reflected in our projected discounted cash flow analyses 
as a result of the impact of these factors on our projected discounted cash flow analyses  the related carrying value exceeded its fair value  resulting in an impairment charge of million for the excess 
for our impairment test  cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts are assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately  but given current uncertainties  reflect no net aum flows trending to moderate inflows in years and  respectively 
projected cash flows of the domestic mutual fund contracts are discounted at  reflecting the business and legg mason specific factors noted above 
we believe that investment performance also has a significant influence on our domestic mutual fund contract long term flows  and that recent improvements in performance will favorably impact our flows  as long as performance is strong 
in aggregate  of our domestic mutual fund long term aum was in funds that had outpaced their three year lipper category average at december   the date through which the testing was completed  which compares to at september  generally  there tends to be a four to five year lag before improved investment performance results in increased asset flows 
in addition  we believe a recent reorganization of our distribution platform  which provides an improved focus on the growth of our business  has also favorably impacted our flows 
the improvement in investment performance has assisted distribution personnel in selling more products 
as a result of improved performance and the reorganization of the distribution platform  our us distribution group had net inflows for the nine months through september   with the quarter ended june  having the highest net inflows since march year to date results generally compare slightly favorably to the growth assumptions related to the domestic mutual fund contracts asset impairment testing at december  in the past several years  however  such actual to projection comparisons are less favorable  and flows in the last several months have been less consistent and are considered in our current estimates 
trade names account for of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to permal 
we tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts 
the permal trade name carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value  resulting in a million impairment for the excess 
the resulting fair value of the other trade name significantly exceeded the related carrying amount 
goodwill goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows and ebitda multiples  similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition 
in december  we announced a realignment of our executive management team  which during fiscal  resulted in the combination of our americas and international divisions into one operating segment  global asset management 
internal management reporting has been modified consistent with this realignment such that discrete financial information regularly received by the chief operating decision maker  our chief executive officer  is at the consolidated global asset management business level 
as a result  the former americas and international operating segments are no longer our reporting units  and subsequently  goodwill is recorded and evaluated at one global asset management reporting unit level 
our global asset management reporting unit consists of the operating businesses of our asset management affiliates and our centralized global distribution operations 
in our most recent impairment testing process  all consolidated assets and liabilities were allocated to our single global asset management reporting unit  except deferred tax assets arising from net operating losses not related to any assets or liabilities of the reporting unit 
similarly  the projected operating results of the reporting unit include our holding company corporate costs and overhead  including costs associated with executive management  finance  human resources  legal and compliance  internal audit and other central corporate functions 
goodwill principally originated from the acquisitions of cam  permal and royce 
the value of the reporting unit is based in part  on projected consolidated net cash flows  including all cash flows of assets managed in our mutual funds  closed end funds and other proprietary funds  in addition to separate account assets of our managers 
significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method are consistent with the methodology discussed above for indefinite life intangible assets 
also  at the reporting unit level  future corporate costs are estimated and consolidated with the projected operating results of all our affiliates 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
for the reporting unit discounted projected cash flow analysis  projected cash flows  on an aggregate basis across all asset classes  are assumed to have an average annual growth rate of approximately 
discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt using a market participant perspective  also consistent with the methodology discussed above for indefinite life intangible assets 
for our impairment test during the quarter ended december   the projected cash flows were discounted at to determine their present value  reflecting the company asset specific factors noted above 
we also perform a market based valuation of our reporting unit value  which applies an average of ebitda multiples paid in change of control transactions for peer companies to our ebitda 
the observed average ebitda multiple utilized was x  from ten asset management transactions dated october through december the results of our two estimates of value for the reporting unit the discounted cash flow and ebitda multiple analyses are compared and any significant difference is assessed to determine the reasonableness of each value and whether any adjustment to either result is warranted 
once the values are accepted  the appropriately weighted average of the two reporting unit valuations the discounted cash flow and ebitda multiple analyses is used as the implied fair value of our global asset management reporting unit  which at december   exceeds the carrying value by approximately million 
considering the relative merits of the details involved in each valuation process  we used an equal weighting of the two values for the december testing 
we further assess the accuracy of the reporting unit value determined from these valuation methods by comparing their results to our market capitalization to determine an implied control premium 
the reasonableness of this implied control premium is tested by comparing it to control premiums that have been paid in relevant actual change of control transactions  as further discussed below 
this assessment provides evidence that our underlying assumptions in our analyses of our reporting unit fair value are reasonable 
in calculating our market capitalization for these purposes  market volatility can have a significant impact on our capitalization  and if appropriate  we may consider the average market prices of our stock for a period of up to two months before the test date to determine market capitalization 
a control premium arises from the fact that in an acquisition  there is typically a premium paid over current market prices of publicly traded companies that relates to the ability to control the operations of an acquired company 
further  assessments of control premiums in the asset management industry are difficult because many acquisitions involve privately held companies  or involve only portions of a public company  such that no control premium can be calculated 
asset manager transactions are often valued on ebitda multiples which  absent unusual circumstances  have generally been consistently priced in a range of x to x ebitda over the past several years 
recent market evidence regarding control premiums suggests values of to as realistic and common  and we believe such premiums to be a reasonable range of estimation for our equity value 
our market evidence is from a published source for the two years ended december  and includes transactions from the banking and finance and brokerage and investment consulting industry groups with an average control premium value of 
as noted above  control premium values specific to public asset manager transactions are limited 
however  since  public asset manager transactions available to us had control premium values ranging from to  and averaged 
we consider the specific circumstances of our company to determine whether there are specific differences for our situation that make these market control premiums not applicable 
we also exclude from our consideration outlying values and transactions with known unique circumstances 
based on our analysis and consideration  we believe the implied control premium of determined by our reporting unit value estimation at december   is reasonable in relation to the range of observed relevant market control premium values 
subsequent to our december  analysis  the market price of legg mason common stock has appreciated by more than as of march   which would reduce our implied control premium assuming all other values remain constant 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation plans include stock options  employee stock purchase plans  market based performance share awards  restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock 
under our stock compensation plans  we issue equity awards to directors  officers  and key employees 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance  compensation expense for the years ended march   and  includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method 
also  under the accounting guidance  cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows 
we granted million  million  and million stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
for additional information on share based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of each option grant using the black scholes option pricing model  except for market based grants  for which we would use a monte carlo option pricing model 
both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables 
the inputs for the black scholes model include stock price on the date of grant  exercise price of the option  dividend yield  volatility  expected life and the risk free interest rate  all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions 
we calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the expected life of the options 
we estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant 
the expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled  based upon our historical option exercise experience 
the risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued 
if we used different methods to estimate our variables for the black scholes and monte carlo models  or if we used a different type of option pricing model  the fair value of our option grants might be different 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the federal  state and local jurisdictions of the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction 
due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions  we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes 
management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized  then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision 
substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to us and us taxing jurisdictions 
as of march   us federal deferred tax assets aggregated million  realization of which is expected to require billion of future us earnings  approximately million of which must be in the form of foreign source income 
deferred tax assets generated in us jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire years after they are generated 
based on estimates of future taxable income  using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing  it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time 
with respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits  it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to the utilization of million foreign tax credits as credits will not be realized and an additional valuation allowance of million was recorded in fiscal with respect thereto 
in addition  a valuation allowance was established in prior years for the substantial portion of our deferred tax assets relating to uk taxing jurisdictions 
while tax planning may enhance our positions  the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies 
as of march   us state deferred tax assets aggregated million 
due to state tax planning which will allow for the utilization of net operating losses generated in certain jurisdictions  we recognized a net valuation allowance release of million during fiscal due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates  the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary 
a net valuation allowance release of million in fiscal primarily related to the full release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to australia and singapore offset by an establishment of a valuation allowance against certain uk deferred tax assets 
to the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities  we have considered the timing  nature and jurisdiction of reversals  as well as  future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 
in the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable  we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made 
depending on the facts and circumstances  the charge could be material to our earnings 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due
