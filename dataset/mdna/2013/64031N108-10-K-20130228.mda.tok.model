management has structured the majority of the company derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and the stand alone derivatives must be marked to market  the adjustments for which are included in derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments  net in the statements of income 
in addition  the company has euro denominated bonds of which the principal and accrued interests are re measured at each reporting period to us dollars 
changes in the principal and accrued interest amounts as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments  net 
in connection with the issuance of the euro denominated bonds  the company has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds generally correlates with the change in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
however  the company will experience unrealized gains or losses related to the cross currency interest rate swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
the gains and or losses included in derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments  net in the company statements of income are primarily caused by interest rate and currency exchange rate volatility  as well as the volume and terms of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment 
included in the table of operating results above is additional information which reflects the operating results of this segment excluding the unrealized gains and losses from the company derivative portfolio and the foreign currency transaction adjustments 
the company believes these point in time estimates of asset and liability values related to these financial instruments that are subject to interest and currency rate fluctuations affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
salaries and benefits 
salaries and benefits have decreased year over year due to a reduction of employees as a result of prior year restructuring initiatives and continued focus by the company on managing costs 
other expenses 
other expenses increased during the year ended december  compared to due to an increase in third party servicing fees related to a significant amount of recent loan purchases being serviced at third parties 
other expenses increased during the year ended december  compared to due to a million expense recorded by the company related to its obligation to repurchase non federally insured loans 
excluding this expense  other expenses decreased as a result of the continued focus by the company on managing costs 
intersegment expenses  net 
intersegment expenses primarily include fees paid to the student loan and guaranty servicing operating segment for the servicing of the company s student loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s fee generating businesses are non capital intensive and all produce positive operating cash flows 
as such  a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to the fee based segments and any liquidity or capital needs are satisfied using cash flow from operations 
therefore  the liquidity and capital resources discussion is concentrated on the company s liquidity and capital needs to meet existing debt obligations in the asset generation and management operating segment 
the company may issue equity and debt securities in the future in order to improve capital  increase liquidity  refinance upcoming maturities  or provide for general corporate purposes 
moreover  the company may from time to time repurchase certain amounts of its outstanding secured and unsecured debt securities  including debt securities which the company may issue in the future  for cash and or through exchanges for other securities 
such repurchases or exchanges may be made in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  compliance with securities laws  and other factors 
the amounts involved in any such transactions may be material 
the company has historically utilized operating cash flow  secured financing transactions which include warehouse facilities  asset backed securitizations  and liquidity programs offered by the department  operating lines of credit  and other borrowing arrangements to fund its asset generation and management operations and student loan acquisitions 
in addition  the company has used operating cash flow  borrowings on its unsecured line of credit  and unsecured debt offerings to fund corporate activities  business acquisitions  and repurchases of common stock 
the company has also used its common stock to partially fund certain business acquisitions 
sources of liquidity currently available as of december   the company had cash and investments of million and has million available to borrow on its unsecured line of credit 
in addition  the company has historically generated positive cash flow from operations 
for the years ended december    and  the company had net cash flow from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
as part of the company s issuance of asset backed securitizations in and  the company purchased the class b subordinated notes of million par value and million par value  respectively 
these notes are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  the company has repurchased certain of its own asset backed securities bonds and notes payable 
for accounting purposes  these repurchased notes are effectively retired and are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
however  as of december   million of these securities are legally outstanding at the trust level and the company could sell these notes to third parties or redeem the notes at par as cash is generated by the trust estate 
upon a sale of the class b subordinated notes or repurchased notes to third parties  the company would obtain cash proceeds equal to the market value of the notes on the date of such sale 
the company will continue to use its strong liquidity position to capitalize on market opportunities  including ffelp student loan acquisitions  strategic acquisitions and investments  including continued investments in its core business areas of asset management and finance  loan servicing  payment processing  and enrollment services education planning  and capital management initiatives  including stock repurchases  debt repurchases  and dividend distributions 
liquidity needs and sources of liquidity available to satisfy debt obligations secured by student loan assets and related collateral the company had the following debt obligations outstanding that are secured by student loan assets and related collateral as of december  carrying amount final maturity asset generation and management bonds and notes issued in asset backed securitizations ffelp warehouse facilities department of education conduit other borrowings bonds and notes issued in asset backed securitizations the majority of the company s portfolio of student loans is funded in asset backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturity of the funded assets  thereby minimizing liquidity risk 
in addition  due to i the difference between the yield the company receives on the loans and cost of financing within these transactions  and ii the servicing and administration fees the company earns from these transactions  the company has created a portfolio that will generate earnings and significant cash flow over the life of these transactions 
as of december   based on cash flow models developed to reflect management s current estimate of  among other factors  prepayments  defaults  deferment  forbearance  and interest rates  the company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its portfolio to be approximately billion as detailed below 
the billion includes approximately million as of december  of overcollateralization included in the asset backed securitizations 
these excess net asset positions are reflected variously in the following balances on the consolidated balance sheet student loans receivable  restricted cash and investments  and accrued interest receivable 
the forecasted cash flow presented below includes all loans funded in asset backed securitizations as of december  as of december   the company had billion of loans included in asset backed securitizations  which represented percent of its total ffelp student loan portfolio 
the forecasted cash flow does not include cash flows that the company expects to receive related to loans funded through the department of education s conduit program and other warehouse facilities or loans acquired subsequent to december  
cfforecastjpg 
a the company uses various assumptions  including prepayments and future interest rates  when preparing its cash flow forecast 
these assumptions are further discussed below 
prepayments the primary variable in establishing a life of loan estimate is the level and timing of prepayments 
prepayment rates equal the amount of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance  net of scheduled principal payments 
a number of factors can affect estimated prepayment rates  including the level of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  management may revise its assumptions  which in turn would impact the projected future cash flow 
the company s cash flow forecast above assumes prepayment rates that are generally consistent with those utilized in the company s recent asset backed securities transactions 
if management used a prepayment rate assumption two times greater than what was used to forecast the cash flow  the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately million to million 
interest rates the company funds the majority of its student loans with three month libor indexed floating rate securities 
meanwhile  the interest earned on the company s student loan assets is indexed primarily to a one month libor rate 
the different interest rate characteristics of the company s loan assets and liabilities funding these assets result in basis risk 
the company s cash flow forecast assumes three month libor will exceed one month libor by basis points for the life of the portfolio  which approximates the historical relationship between these indices 
if the forecast is computed assuming a spread of basis points between three month and one month libor for the life of the portfolio  the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately million to million 
the company uses the current forward interest rate yield curve to forecast cash flows 
a change in the forward interest rate curve would impact the future cash flows generated from the portfolio 
an increase in future interest rates will reduce the amount of fixed rate floor income the company is currently receiving 
the company attempts to mitigate the impact of a rise in short term rates by hedging interest rate risks 
as of december   the net fair value of the company s interest rate derivatives used to hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income was a liability of million 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
ffelp warehouse facilities the company funds a portion of its ffelp loan acquisitions using its ffelp warehouse facilities 
student loan warehousing allows the company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
as of december   the company had three ffelp warehouse facilities with an aggregate maximum financing amount available of billion  of which billion was outstanding and billion was available for additional funding 
two of the warehouse facilities provide for formula based advance rates  depending on ffelp loan type  up to a maximum of the principal and interest of loans financed 
one ffelp warehouse facility has static advance rates that requires initial equity for loan funding  but does not require increased equity based in market movements 
as of december   the company had million advanced as equity support on these facilities 
for further discussion of the company ffelp warehouse facilities outstanding at december   see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
on january   the company entered into a fourth ffelp warehouse facility which has a maximum financing amount of million  liquidity provisions that expire on january   and a final maturity date of january  upon termination or expiration of the warehouse facilities  the company would expect to access the securitization market  obtain replacement warehouse facilities  use operating cash  rely on sale of assets  or transfer collateral to satisfy any remaining obligations 
department of education conduit in may  the department implemented a program under which it financed eligible ffelp stafford and plus loans in a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for student lenders the conduit program 
the conduit program accepted eligible loans through july  as of december   the company had billion borrowed under the facility and million advanced as equity support in the conduit program 
on february   all student loans funded in the conduit program were refinanced in an asset backed securitization and the company ffelp warehouse facilities 
after these transactions  no loans will remain financed under the conduit program 
other uses of liquidity effective july   the reconciliation act of prohibits new loan originations under the ffel program and requires that all new federal loan originations be made through the federal direct loan program 
as a result  the company no longer originates new ffelp loans 
the company believes there will continue to be opportunities to purchase ffelp loan portfolios from current ffelp participants looking to adjust their ffelp businesses 
during the years ended december    and  the company purchased billion par value  billion  par value  and billion par value of ffelp student loans 
the company plans to fund additional ffelp student loan acquisitions from third parties using its union bank participation agreement as described below  using its ffelp warehouse facilities as described above  and continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
union bank participation agreement the company maintains an agreement with union bank  as trustee for various grantor trusts  under which union bank has agreed to purchase from the company participation interests in student loans the ffelp participation agreement 
as of december   million of loans were subject to outstanding participation interests held by union bank  as trustee  under this agreement 
the agreement automatically renews annually and is terminable by either party upon five business days notice 
this agreement provides beneficiaries of union bank s grantor trusts with access to investments in interests in student loans  while providing liquidity to the company 
the company can participate loans to union bank to the extent of availability under the grantor trusts  up to million or an amount in excess of million if mutually agreed to by both parties 
loans participated under this agreement have been accounted for by the company as loan sales 
accordingly  the participation interests sold are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
asset backed securities transactions depending on market conditions  the company anticipates continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
asset backed securities transactions would be used to refinance student loans included in the ffelp warehouse facilities and or existing asset backed security transactions 
the ffelp warehouse facilities have advance rates that are less than par 
as of december   the company had approximately million advanced in the ffelp warehouse facilities 
depending on the terms of asset backed security transactions  refinancing loans included in these facilities could produce positive cash flow to the company by reducing required advance rates and are contemplated by management when making student loan financing decisions 
although the company has more recently demonstrated its ability to access the asset backed securities market and expects asset backed securities transactions to remain a primary source of funding over the long term  the company also expects its pricing to be less favorable than prior to the credit market dislocation that began in august liquidity impact related to hedging activities the company utilizes derivative instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity 
by using derivative instruments  the company is exposed to market risk which could impact its liquidity 
when the fair value of a derivative instrument is negative a liability in the company balance sheet  it would owe the counterparty if the derivative was settled 
if the negative fair value of derivatives with a counterparty exceeds a specified threshold  the company may have to make a collateral deposit with the counterparty 
the threshold at which the company may be required to post collateral is dependent upon its unsecured credit rating 
based on the company current unsecured credit ratings standard poor bbb stable outlook and moody ba stable outlook  the company has substantially collateralized its corporate derivative liability position with counterparties 
as such  any downgrades from the current ratings would not result in additional collateral requirements of a material nature 
in addition  no counterparty has the right to terminate its contracts in the event of downgrades from the current rating 
however  some long dated derivative contracts have mutual optional termination provisions that can be exercised in    and as of december   the fair value of derivatives with early termination provisions was a positive million an asset in the company balance sheet 
based on the derivative portfolio outstanding as of december   the company does not currently anticipate any movement in interest rates having a material impact on its capital or liquidity profile  nor does the company expect that any movement in interest rates would have a material impact on its ability to meet potential collateral deposits with its counterparties 
however  if interest rates move materially and negatively impact the fair value of the company derivative portfolio or if the company enters into additional derivatives for which the fair value becomes negative  the company could be required to deposit additional collateral with its derivative instrument counterparties 
the collateral deposits  if significant  could negatively impact the company liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   the fair value of the company derivatives  which had a negative fair value a liability in the company balance sheet  was million  and the company had million posted as collateral with derivative counterparties 
other debt facilities the company has a million unsecured line of credit with a maturity date of february  as of december   the unsecured line of credit had an outstanding balance of million and million was available for future use 
upon the maturity date in there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this line of credit  increase the amount outstanding under the line  or find alternative funding if necessary 
in september  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated hybrid securities hybrid securities that have a final maturity of september  the hybrid securities are unsecured obligations of the company 
as of december   million of hybrid securities were outstanding 
for further discussion of these unsecured debt obligations of the company  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
debt repurchases due to the company positive liquidity position and opportunities in the capital markets  the company has repurchased debt over the last several years 
gains recorded by the company from the purchase of debt are included in gain on the sale of loans and debt repurchases on the company s consolidated statements of income 
a summary of debt repurchases follows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  notional amount purchase price gain notional amount purchase price gain notional amount purchase price gain unsecured debt junior subordinated hybrid securities asset backed securities stock repurchases the board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to a total of five million shares of the company class a common stock during the three year period ending may  shares may be repurchased from time to time depending on various factors  including share prices and other potential uses of liquidity 
shares repurchased by the company during   and are shown in the table below 
total shares repurchased purchase price in thousands average price of shares repurchased per share year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  subsequent to december  through february   the company has repurchased  shares for million per share 
these share repurchases were made pursuant to a trading plan adopted by the company in accordance with rule b under the securities exchange act of as of february   approximately  shares remain authorized for purchase under the company repurchase program 
dividends dividends of per share on the company s class a and class b common stock were paid on march   june   and september   respectively 
on november   the company paid a cash dividend of per share  consisting of a regular quarterly dividend of per share and a special cash dividend of per share 
the company board of directors declared a first quarter cash dividend on the company class a and class b common stock of per share 
the dividend will be paid on march   to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  the company currently plans to continue making regular quarterly dividend payments  subject to future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  and other factors 
in addition  the payment of dividends is subject to the terms of the company s outstanding hybrid securities  which generally provide that if the company defers interest payments on those securities it cannot pay dividends on its capital stock 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations were as follows as of december  total less than year to years to years more than years bonds and notes payable a operating lease obligations b total a amounts exclude interest as substantially all bonds and notes payable carry variable rates of interest 
b the company is committed under noncancelable operating leases for certain office space and equipment 
operating lease obligations are presented net of approximately million in sublease arrangements 
as of december   the company had a reserve of million for uncertain income tax positions including the federal benefit received from state positions 
this obligation is not included in the above table as the timing and resolution of the income tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
as of december   the company had participated a cumulative amount of million par value of non federally insured loans to third parties 
loans participated under these agreements have been accounted for by the company as loan sales 
accordingly  the participation interests sold are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
per the terms of the servicing agreements  the company s servicing operations are obligated to repurchase loans subject to the participation interests in the event such loans become or days delinquent 
in addition  on january   the company sold a portfolio of non federally insured loans for proceeds of million par value 
the company retained credit risk related to this portfolio and will pay cash to purchase back any loans which become days delinquent 
as of december   the outstanding balance of loans related to this loan sale was million par value 
as of december   the company has million accrued related to these repurchase obligations which is included in other liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these obligations are not included in the above table 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below allowance for loan losses  revenue recognition  impairment assessments related to goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  and accounting for derivatives 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses on student loans 
this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on its federally insured loan portfolio separately from its non federally insured loan portfolio 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  type of program  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest is days past due and charges off the loan and accrued interest when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans and the repurchase obligation related to loans sold are maintained at a level management believes is appropriate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolios 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
revenue recognition student loan income the company recognizes student loan income as earned  net of amortization accretion of loan premiums and discounts and deferred origination costs 
loan income is recognized based upon the expected yield of the loan after giving effect to borrower utilization of incentives such as principal reductions for timely payments borrower benefits and other yield adjustments 
the estimate of the borrower benefits discount is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive and liquidity purposes  the company frequently changed the borrower benefit programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefit discount 
loan premiums discounts  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
the most sensitive estimate related to the amortization accretion of loan premiums discounts  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits is the estimate of the constant prepayment rate cpr 
cpr is a variable in the life of loan estimate that measures the rate at which loans in a portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is directly correlated to the average life of the portfolio 
cpr equals the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance  net of scheduled principal payments 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate  including the level of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the amount of loan premium discount and deferred origination cost amortization recognized by the company in a particular period 
the company also earns revenue from its service and product offerings in its fee based operating segments  including loan and guaranty servicing  tuition payment processing and campus commerce  and enrollment services revenue 
the revenue recognition policy for these services and products can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
fees associated with the majority of the services included in the fee based operating segments are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties 
the company assesses collectability of revenues and its allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to record accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
if the company determines that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured at or prior to delivery of the company s services  revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of november and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
in  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued new accounting guidance to simplify how an entity tests for goodwill impairment by allowing entities to first assess certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of certain events or circumstances would lead to a determination that it would be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  instead of first performing a fair value analysis for each reporting unit 
entities that conclude  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount are not required to perform the two step impairment test 
for the annual review of goodwill  the company assessed qualitative factors and concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units were less than their carrying amount 
as such  the company was not required to perform the two step impairment test 
the new accounting guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance  and entity specific events 
the examples of events and circumstances are not intended to be all inclusive  and an entity may identify other relevant events or circumstances to consider in determining whether to perform the first step of the two step impairment test 
none of the individual examples of events and circumstances are intended to represent standalone events or circumstances that necessarily would require an entity to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
in reaching its conclusion about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company also considered the extent to which an adverse event or circumstance  if any  affected the reporting unit fair value 
the company placed more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect a reporting unit fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets 
the company also considered positive and mitigating events and circumstances 
in addition  the company compared recent fair value calculations of reporting units  when available  to the carrying amount of the reporting units in deciding whether the first step of the impairment test was necessary 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets annually and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist 
in addition  each quarter  the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
the company evaluation of whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount and assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of the company s intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and internal forecasts 
although the company believes the historical assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the reported financial results 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities in which the company operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
the company reviews these balances quarterly and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted  as appropriate 
derivative accounting the company records derivative instruments at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
the company determines the fair value for its derivative contracts using either i pricing models that consider current market conditions and the contractual terms of the derivative contract or ii counterparty valuations 
these factors include interest rates  time value  forward interest rate curve  and volatility factors  as well as foreign exchange rates 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements issued  but not yet effective disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance on disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the guidance requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions that are offset in the balance sheet  as well as instruments and transactions that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
in january  the fasb issued guidance clarifying the scope of the disclosures to apply only to derivatives  including bifurcated embedded derivatives  repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities lending and securities borrowing transactions 
this guidance is effective january   with retrospective application required 
we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 
reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued accounting guidance on the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the guidance requires an entity to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income if the amount is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  a cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about the reclassification amounts is required 
this guidance is effective january  we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all dollars are in thousands  except share amounts  unless otherwise noted interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could impact the company due to shifts in market interest rates 
the following table sets forth the company s loan assets and debt instruments by rate characteristics as of december  as of december  dollars percent dollars percent fixed rate loan assets variable rate loan assets total fixed rate debt instruments variable rate debt instruments total loans originated prior to april  generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable indice plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company may earn additional spread income that it refers to as floor income 
depending on the type of loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company may earn floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income  and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on july  the company may earn floor income to the next reset date  which the company refers to as variable rate floor income 
lenders are required to rebate fixed rate floor income and variable rate floor income to the department for all new ffelp loans first originated on or after april  no variable rate floor income was earned by the company during the years ended december    and a summary of fixed rate floor income earned by the company during these years follows 
year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income 
the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during   and are due to historically low interest rates 
if interest rates remain low  the company anticipates continuing to earn significant fixed rate floor income in future periods 
absent the use of derivative instruments  a rise in interest rates may reduce the amount of floor income received and this may have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increasing financing costs  until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with their special allowance payment formulas 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively become variable rate loans  the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced 
the following graph depicts fixed rate floor income for a borrower with a fixed rate of and a sap rate of

the following table shows the company s student loan assets that are earning fixed rate floor income as of december  fixed interest range borrower lender weighted average yield estimated variable conversion rate a loan balance a the estimated variable conversion rate is the estimated short term interest rate at which loans would convert to a variable rate 
as of december   the weighted average estimated variable conversion rate was

the following table summarizes the outstanding derivative instruments as of december  used by the company to hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income
