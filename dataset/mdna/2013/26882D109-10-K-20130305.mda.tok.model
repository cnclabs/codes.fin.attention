bankruptcy filings for the twelve month period ended december  decreased versus the twelve month period ended december  during this period  chapter filings decreased  chapter filings fell  and chapter filings decreased 
our bankruptcy business provides solutions that address the needs of chapter and chapter bankruptcy trustees to administer bankruptcy proceedings and of chapter debtor corporations that file a plan of reorganization 
chapter is a liquidation bankruptcy for individuals or businesses that  as measured by the number of new cases filed in the twelve month period ended december   accounted for approximately of all bankruptcy filings 
in a chapter case  the debtor assets are liquidated and the resulting cash proceeds are used by the chapter bankruptcy trustee to pay creditors 
chapter cases typically last several years 
chapter is a reorganization model of bankruptcy for corporations that  as measured by the number of new cases filed in the twelve month period ended december   accounted for less than of all bankruptcy filings 
chapter generally allows a company  often referred to as the debtor in possession  to continue operating under a plan of reorganization to restructure its business and to modify payment terms of both secured and unsecured obligations

the key participants in a bankruptcy proceeding include the debtor in possession  the debtor legal counsel  the creditors  the creditors legal counsel  and the bankruptcy judge

table of contents the executive office for united states trustees  a division of the united states department of justice  appoints all bankruptcy trustees 
a united states trustee is appointed in most federal court districts and generally has responsibility for overseeing the integrity of the bankruptcy system 
the bankruptcy trustee primary responsibilities include liquidating the debtor assets or collecting funds from the debtor  distributing the collected funds to creditors pursuant to the orders of the bankruptcy court and preparing regular status reports for the executive office for united states trustees and for the bankruptcy court 
trustees manage an entire caseload of bankruptcy cases simultaneously 
the application of chapter bankruptcy regulations has the practical effect of discouraging trustee customers from incurring direct administrative costs for computer system expenses 
as a result  we provide our chapter products and services to our trustee customers at no direct charge  and they maintain deposit accounts for bankruptcy cases under their administration at a designated banking institution 
we have arrangements with various banks under which we provide the bankruptcy trustee case management software and related services  and the bank provides the bankruptcy trustee with deposit related banking services 
our chapter trustee services deposit portfolio was approximately billion throughout  while pricing continued at lower levels under our agreements and continues to be impacted by the low short term interest rate environment 
our bankruptcy segment relies on bankruptcy filings which impact the demand for new restructuring engagements 
the segment was impacted during by the overall declining trends in the number of bankruptcy filings due in part to the improvements in the credit markets which allowed many companies and individuals to restructure their debt and or postpone debt maturities 
we believe that the levels of bankruptcy filings may increase in the short term as companies face the next cycle of debt maturities combined with continued high unemployment and the worldwide economic challenges 
we remain one of the market leaders in each of the chapter  and markets that we serve  and we continue to maintain a substantial aggregate chapter deposit balance

non software arrangements certain services related to ediscovery and settlement administration are billed based on volume 
for these contractual arrangements  we have identified each deliverable service element 
based on our evaluation of each element  we have determined that each element delivered has standalone value to our customers because we or other vendors sell such services separately from any other services deliverables 
we have also obtained objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each element based either on the price we charge when we sell an element on a standalone basis or based on third party evidence of fair value of such similar services 
for elements where evidence cannot be established  the best estimate of sales price has been used 
lastly  our arrangements do not include general rights of return 
accordingly  each of the service elements in our multiple element case and document management arrangements qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
we allocate revenue to 
table of contents the various units of accounting in our arrangements based on the fair value or best estimated selling price of each unit of accounting  which is generally consistent with the stated prices in our arrangements 
in instances when revenue has been required to be deferred  we utilize the relative selling price method to calculate the revenue recognized 
as we have evidence of an arrangement  revenue for each separate unit of accounting is recognized each period 
revenue is recognized as the services are rendered  our fee becomes fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received in advance of satisfaction of the related revenue recognition criteria are recognized as a customer deposit or deferred revenue until all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
software arrangements for our chapter bankruptcy trustee arrangements  we provide our trustee clients with a software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and post contract customer support services  all at no charge to the trustee 
the trustees place their liquidated estate deposits with a financial institution with which we have an arrangement 
we earn contingent monthly fees from the financial institutions based on the average dollar amount of deposits held by the trustees with that financial institution related to the software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and post contract customer support services provided to our trustee clients 
the monthly fees have two components consisting of an interest based component and a non interest based service fee component 
since we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the software license  we do not recognize any revenue on delivery of the software 
the software element is deferred and included with the remaining undelivered elements  which are post contract customer support services 
revenue related to post contract customer support is entirely contingent on the placement of liquidated estate deposits by the trustee with the financial institution 
accordingly  we recognize this contingent usage based revenue as the fee becomes fixed or determinable at the time actual usage occurs and collectability is probable 
this occurs monthly as a result of the computation  billing and collection of monthly deposit fees contractually agreed to 
at that time  we have also satisfied the other revenue recognition criteria since we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we also provide our trustee clients with certain hardware  such as desktop computers  monitors  and printers  and hardware maintenance 
we retain ownership of all hardware provided and we account for this hardware as a lease 
as the hardware maintenance arrangement is an executory contract similar to an operating lease  we use guidance related to contingent rentals in operating lease arrangements for hardware maintenance as well as for the hardware lease 
since the payments under all of our arrangements are contingent upon the level of trustee deposits and the delivery of upgrades and other services  and there remain important uncertainties regarding the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us  we account for the hardware lease as an operating lease 
therefore  all lease payments  based on the estimated fair value of hardware provided  were accounted for as contingent rentals  which requires that we recognize rental income when the changes in the factor on which the contingent lease payment is based actually occur 
this occurs at the end of each period as we achieve our target when deposits are held at the depository financial institution as  at that time  evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the amount has become fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
this revenue  which is less than ten percent of our total revenue for the years ended december    and  is included in the consolidated statements of income as a component of operating revenue 
reimbursements we have revenue related to the reimbursement of certain costs  primarily postage 
reimbursed postage and other reimbursable direct costs are recorded gross in the consolidated statements of income as reimbursed expenses and as reimbursed direct costs  respectively 

table of contents business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses in recent years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and contingent consideration issued in a business combination 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to these assets and liabilities in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including quoted market prices and estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
acquisition related costs for potential and completed acquisitions are expensed  as incurred  and are included in other operating expense in our consolidated statements of income 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the projected revenue over the measurement period  and applying an appropriate discount rate based upon the weighted average cost of capital 
this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and variances from such estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  because they are based on estimates and judgment  they are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates included in business combination accounting may include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from projected revenues  the acquired company trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio  customer attrition rates  new client acquisition rates  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  pricing for products and services  long term growth rates and discount rates 
in connection with the acquisitions of jupiter esources and de novo  we incurred liabilities related to potential contingent consideration based on future revenue growth 
we estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration using probability assessments of projected revenue over the measurement period  and applied an appropriate discount rate based upon the weighted average cost of capital 
this fair value is based on significant inputs not observable in the market 
jupiter esources in connection with the acquisition of jupiter  the undiscounted amount of all potential future payments that could have been required under the de novo contingent consideration is between and million 
during  based on our probability assessments of projected revenue over the remainder of the measurement period  we determined that it was not likely that any contingent consideration for jupiter esources would be realized and recognized a total decrease in the fair value of million which was reflected in fair value adjustment to contingent consideration on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  our probability assessment of projected revenue over the remainder of the measurement period did not change in and as such there was no liability recorded related to this contingent consideration as of december  and de novo in connection with the acquisition of de novo  the undiscounted amount of all potential future payments that could have been required under the de novo contingent consideration opportunity is between and million over a two year measurement period following the december  date of acquisition 
during  based on projected revenue over the remainder of the measurement 
table of contents period  we recorded a total decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation of million 
these adjustments are included in fair value adjustment to contingent consideration in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the jupiter and de novo contingent consideration 
goodwill goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting unit level and we have identified our operating segments ediscovery  bankruptcy and settlement administration as our reporting units for purposes of testing for goodwill impairment 
goodwill is assessed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  a change in strategic direction  legal factors  operating performance indicators  a change in the competitive environment  the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units 
our annual test is performed as of july each year  and there have been no events since the annual test to indicate that it is more likely than not that the recorded goodwill balance has become impaired 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we considered both a market approach and an income approach in order to develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of our annual impairment test 
when available  and as appropriate  we use market multiples derived from a set of competitors or companies with comparable market characteristics to establish fair values for a particular reporting unit market approach 
we also estimate fair value using discounted projected cash flow analysis income approach 
potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds its estimated fair value 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
in addition  financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital  used to determine our discount rate  and through our stock price  used to determine our market capitalization 
we may be required to recognize impairment of goodwill based on future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units 
if we determine that the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit carrying value  then we proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to measure the potential impairment charge 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value 
if goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding potential future economic impacts on our reporting units  there can be no assurances that estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if assumptions regarding forecasted revenues or margins of certain of our reporting units are not achieved  we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods 
it is not 
table of contents possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would occur  and if it did occur  whether such charge would be material 
our recognized goodwill totaled million as of december  as of july   which is the date of our most recent impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the following table illustrates the percentages by which each reporting unit fair value and our aggregate fair value exceeded its carrying value as of july   the date of the most recent impairment test 
in addition the table includes sensitivity analyses related to changes in certain key assumptions for each reporting unit 
the impact of each assumption change within the sensitivity analyses was calculated independently and excludes the impact of the other assumed changes 
ediscovery bankruptcy settlement administration total fair values in excess of carrying values percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value as of july  sensitivity analysis changes in certain key assumptions percentage by which fair value would exceed carrying value increase in discount rate decrease in long term growth assumptions increase in discount rate and a decrease in long term growth assumes all other inputs remain the same  the impact of each assumption change within the sensitivity analyses above was calculated independently and excludes the impact of the other assumed changes 
total fair value of the company was determined using the nasdaq stock price as of the measurement date adjusted by an assumed control premium 
changes in the discount rate or growth rates of individual reporting units would therefore not impact the total fair value of the company in any of the sensitivity analyses presented above 
identifiable intangible assets identifiable intangible assets  resulting from various business acquisitions  consist of customer relationships  agreements not to compete  and trade names 
we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated economic benefit period  generally from five to ten years 
these definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
additionally  information resulting from other events and circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable which would result in recognition of an impairment charge 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment and also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable 
impairment of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives occurs when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
if impaired  the asset carrying amount is reduced to its fair value 

table of contents the aacer trade name identifiable intangible asset recognized in connection with the acquisition of jupiter esources was originally determined to have an indefinite life and was therefore not amortized from its october  acquisition date through june  during the second quarter of  the remaining useful life of the aacer trade name was evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances continued to support an indefinite useful life and it was determined that an indefinite life was no longer appropriate 
this conclusion was based on plans to market current and potential future products or services under the epiq trade name and we expect the useful life of the aacer trade name to be ten years 
accordingly  we began amortizing this trade name beginning on july  due to the change from an indefinite life to a ten year useful life  we tested the aacer trade name for impairment as of june   based on financial forecasts and the expected useful life of ten years 
per the results of this valuation analysis  the carrying value of the trade name exceeded its fair value by million and accordingly we recorded this amount in the second quarter of as intangible asset impairment expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the discount rate used in the relief from royalty method approach for the trade name valuation was 
a hypothetical increase to the discount rate of would have lowered the fair value determined under the relief from royalty method by approximately million  or  which  with all other variables remaining the same  would have resulted in additional impairment expense of approximately million 
a hypothetical decrease of in our assumed revenue growth would have lowered the fair value by approximately million  or  which  with all other variables remaining the same  would have resulted in additional impairment expense of million 
a hypothetical decrease of in our assumed revenue growth would have lowered the fair value by approximately million  or  which  with all other variables remaining the same  would have resulted in additional impairment expense of approximately million 
a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more identifiable intangible assets or the impairment of one or more identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our identifiable intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of december  recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued a new standard related to comprehensive income 
this new standard requires companies to present comprehensive income in a single statement below net income or in a separate statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement 
in both options  companies must present the components of net income  total net income  the components of other comprehensive income  total other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income 
this new standard does not change which items are reported in other comprehensive income or the requirement to report reclassifications of items from other comprehensive income to net income 
the new standard eliminates the option to present comprehensive income on the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
this requirement was effective for us beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  and required retrospective application for all periods presented 
we have elected to present statements of comprehensive income in a single statement of comprehensive income immediately following the consolidated statements of income 
in may  the fasb issued new standards to provide guidance about fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
these standards do not extend the use of fair value but rather provide guidance about how fair value should be determined where it is already required or permitted under generally accepted accounting principles 
a majority of the changes include clarifications of existing guidance and new disclosure requirements related to changes in valuation technique and related inputs 
table of contents that result from applying the standard 
we adopted this guidance and applied the new standard prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued guidance that amends the existing standards related to annual and interim impairment tests for indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
current guidance requires companies to test indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment  at least annually  by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
the updated guidance provides companies with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to calculate the indefinite lived intangible asset fair value 
under this option  companies are no longer required to calculate the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset unless they determine  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment will be effective for us beginning with annual and interim impairment tests of indefinite lived intangible assets performed after january  because we do not have any indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed include interest rates under our senior revolving credit facility  foreign exchange rates giving rise to translation  and fluctuations in short term interest rates on a portion of our bankruptcy trustee revenue 
interest rate risk interest on our senior revolving credit facility is generally based on a spread  not to exceed basis points over the libor rate 
as of december   we had borrowed million under the senior revolving loan 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applied to the average daily borrowings of the senior revolving loan 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such a movement would have increased our interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december  in our chapter bankruptcy business we earn deposit based fees 
these fees are earned primarily on a percentage of chapter total liquidated assets placed on deposit with a designated financial institution by our trustee clients 
the fees we earn based on total liquidated assets placed on deposit by our trustee clients may vary based on fluctuations in short term interest rates 
based on sensitivity analysis we performed for the year ended december   together with the low level of interest rates  any further reduction in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results from operations or cash flows 
we currently do not hold any interest rate floor options or other derivatives 
foreign currency risk we have operations outside of the united states  therefore  a portion of our revenues and expenses are incurred in a currency other than united states dollars 
we do not utilize hedge instruments to manage the exposures associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the united states dollar and the functional currency of the countries where we have operations 
when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the united states dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase in foreign exchange rates applied to our historical results of operations 
for the year ended december   the analysis indicated that such a movement would not have had a material effect on our total revenues or net income for the year ended december
