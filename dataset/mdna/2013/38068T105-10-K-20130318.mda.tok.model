developments during we completed our second full year of commercial production of gold and silver in two mines are located at our el aguila project  the el aguila open pit mine and the la arista underground mine 
mining at the el aguila open pit mine was essentially completed in and we transitioned to processing ore from the la arista underground mine in march we produced metal concentrates from the la arista underground mine with gold and silver as our primary metal products and copper  lead and zinc as by products 
during  we continued to develop the decline ramp for the underground mine and reached level by the end of the year 
we have developed stopes and faces for mining from level to level underground infrastructure and mine development completed in included additional ventilation fans  ground water pumping stations and electrical infrastructure expansion 
various ore stopes were developed and mining methods of long hole stoping and cut and fill were utilized 
the management team was strengthened with the addition of our chief operating officer and on site managerial changes included our new project manager  mine superintendent  mill superintendent and maintenance manager 
we established a new wholly owned turkish subsidiary corporation named gold resource madencilik sanayi ve ticaret limited sirketi in the event we decide to expand our exploration property portfolio outside of mexico 
we are in the early stages of identifying potential properties for acquisition in turkey and do not have significant operations at this time 
production summary during  we produced from the mill a total of  ounces of gold equivalent from the el aguila project  which was a increase in mill production over we processed an aggregate of  tonnes of ore with an average grade of grams per tonne gold and grams per tonne silver 
see the table titled production and sales statistics el aguila project in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for detailed information regarding our production statistics 
exploration exploration during continued to focus primarily on the el aguila project with infill and step out drilling at the la arista vein system 
we also performed exploration at several of our other properties  including commencing a surface drill program on portions of the las margaritas property and completing a limited drilling campaign at alta gracia and el chamizo focusing on previously identified drill targets 
please see the map of our properties on page for more information regarding our exploration properties 
we conducted limited underground exploration and testing at the alta gracia property by driving drifts and crosscuts into surface exposed veins 
to date  we have not established proven or probable reserves as defined in the sec s industry guide guide at our el aguila project or any of our other properties 
see item properties for additional information regarding our exploration activities 
dividends we declared an aggregate of per share in dividends in in april  we commenced a physical dividend program pursuant to which our shareholders have the option to convert the cash dividends we pay into physical gold and silver bullion and take delivery of their metal 
see  item market for common equity  related stockholder matters and purchase of equity securities  and item management s discussion and analysis for additional information 
no proven or probable reserves we have not yet demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at our el aguila project in oaxaca  mexico or any of our other properties 
in guide  the sec defines a reserve as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
proven or probable reserves are those reserves for which a quantity is computed and b the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are spaced so closely that the geologic character is defined and size  shape and depth of mineral content can be established proven or the sites are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced but high enough to assume continuity between observation points probable 
reserves cannot be considered proven or probable unless and until they are supported by a feasibility study  indicating that the reserves have had the requisite geologic  technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable 
we have not completed a feasibility study with regard to all or a portion of any of our properties to date 
any mineralized material discovered or produced by us should not be considered proven or probable reserves 
as of december   none of our mineralized material met the definition of proven or probable reserves 
competitive business conditions the exploration for  and the acquisition of gold and silver properties  are subject to intense competition 
identifying and evaluating potential mining prospects is a costly and time consuming endeavor 
due to our limited capital and personnel  we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many other companies with regard to exploration and  if warranted  development of mining properties 
our present limited capital means that our ability to compete for properties to be explored and developed is limited 
we believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense in the future 
government regulations and permits in connection with mining  milling and exploration activities  we are subject to extensive mexican federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment  including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality  hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species 
the department responsible for environmental protection in mexico is semarnat  which is similar to the united states environmental protection agency 
semarnat has broad authority to shut down and or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with its environmental regulations or standards 
potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies  including ours  include but are not limited to  acid rock drainage  cyanide containment and handling  contamination of water courses  dust and noise 
in connection with our mill and mining operations at the el aguila project  we have and will continue to secure various regulatory permits from federal  state and local agencies 
these governmental and regulatory permits generally govern the processes being used to operate  the stipulations concerning air quality and water issues  and the plans and obligations for reclamation of the properties at the conclusion of operations 
regulations require that an environmental impact statement  known in mexico as a manifiestacion de impacto ambiental mia  be prepared by a third party contractor for submission to semarnat 
we have submitted our mia to semarnat for their review and it has been approved 
studies required to support the mia include a detailed analysis of these areas  among others soil  water  vegetation  wildlife  cultural resources and socio economic impacts 
although the regulatory process in mexico has a public review component  proof of local community support for a project is required to gain final mia approval 
we have received the required local community support for the el aguila area where we are currently producing from 
we received a federal permit granting permission to begin open pit mining at the el aguila project from semarnat in august and commenced mining operations soon thereafter 
in december  we also received a permit allowing us to begin developing our underground mine 
we purchased a permitted water well for the mill site at the el aguila project 
we believe the water provided by this well will normally be adequate to meet the needs for any mining activity for the foreseeable future  but any extreme seasonal changes may limit our water supply  which could adversely affect our mining operations 
we have obtained  and plan to obtain at the appropriate time  environmental permits  licenses or approvals required for operations 
we are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits  licenses or approvals issued with respect to our operations 
customers during the year ended december   of our total sales of metals concentrate were made to consorcio minero de mexico cormin mex 
sa de sa  a trafigura group company 
in the event that our relationship with trafigura is interrupted for any reason  we believe that we would be able to locate another entity to purchase our metals concentrate and by product metals 
however  any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and adversely affect our operating results 
we are reviewing our options of alternative sales outlets to mitigate the concentration of risk with one concentrate buyer in case of any unforeseen disruptions 
employees we currently have nine full time employees  five of which serve as our executive officers 
these individuals devote all of their business time to our affairs 
in mexico  through our wholly owned mexican subsidiaries  we employ approximately mexican nationals  including our el aguila project manager 
we also use various independent contractors for developing our underground mine  surface exploration drilling and trucking 
in turkey  we employ four turkish nationals through our wholly owned turkish subsidiary 
item a 
risk factors this report  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  contains forward looking statements that may be materially affected by several risk factors  including those summarized below risks relating to our company we have incurred substantial losses in the past and may not continue to be profitable 
during the fiscal years ended december  and  we reported net income of million and million  respectively  and for the fiscal year ended december   we reported net loss of approximately million 
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  while we were profitable in  there is no assurance that we will continue to be profitable in the future 
unexpected interruptions in our mining business may cause us to incur losses or the revenue we generate from production may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations including exploration and development costs 
our failure to report future profits may adversely affect the price of our common stock and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our existing production is limited to a single mine and any interruptions or stoppages in our mining activities would adversely affect our revenue 
we are presently relying on a single mine to provide ore for processing at our mill facility which contains the mineralized material we sell to fund our operations 
any interruption in our ability to mine this location  such as a labor strike  natural disaster  or loss of permits would negatively impact our ability to collect revenue in the foreseeable future 
additionally  if we are unable to economically develop additional mines  we will eventually deplete the ore body and will no longer generate revenue sufficient to fund our operations 
a decrease in or cessation of our mining operations would adversely affect our financial performance and may eventually cause us to cease operations 
if we are unable to achieve gold and silver production levels anticipated from our el aguila project  our financial condition and results of operation will be adversely affected 
we have proceeded with the processing of the el aguila open pit area ore and the development of the la arista mine at the el aguila project based on estimates of mineralized material identified in our drilling program and estimates of gold and silver recovery based on test work developed during our scoping study 
however  risks related to metallurgy are inherent when working with extractable minerals 
sales of gold and silver that we realize from future mining activity will be less than anticipated if the mined material does not contain the concentration of gold and silver predicted by our geological exploration 
this risk may be increased since we have not sought or obtained a feasibility study or reserve report with regard to any of our properties 
if sales of gold and silver are less than anticipated  we may not be able to recover our investment in our property and our operations may be adversely affected 
our inability to realize production based on quarterly or annual projections may also adversely affect the price of our common stock and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have no proven or probable reserves and our decision to commence commercial production is not based on a study demonstrating economic recovery of any mineral reserves and is therefore inherently risky 
any funds spent by us on exploration or development could be lost 
we have not established the presence of any proven or probable mineral reserves  as defined by the sec  at any of our properties 
under guide  the sec has defined a reserve as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
any mineralized material discovered or produced by us should not be considered proven or probable reserves 
in order to demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves  it would be necessary for us to perform additional exploration to demonstrate the existence of sufficient mineralized material with satisfactory continuity and obtain a positive feasibility study which demonstrates with reasonable certainty that the deposit can be economically and legally extracted and produced 
we have not completed a feasibility study with regard to all or a portion of any of our properties to date 
since we commenced commercial production of mineralized material at the el aguila project without a feasibility study  there is inherent uncertainty as to whether the mineralized material can be economically produced or if so  for what period of time 
the absence of proven or probable reserves makes it more likely that our properties may cease to be profitable and that the money we spend on exploration and development may never be recovered 
since we have no proven or probable reserves  our investment in mineral properties is not reported as an asset in our financial statements which may cause volatility in our net earnings and have a negative impact on the price of our stock 
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and report substantially all exploration and construction expenditures as expenses until such time  if ever  we are able to establish proven or probable reserves 
since it is uncertain when  if ever  we will establish proven or probable reserves  it is uncertain whether we will ever report these types of future capital expenditures as an asset 
accordingly  our financial statements report fewer assets and greater expenses than would be the case if we had proven or probable reserves  which could produce volatility in our earnings and have a negative impact on our stock price 
estimates of mineralized material are based on interpretation and assumptions and may yield less mineral production under actual conditions than is currently estimated 
when making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects to development  such as the el aguila project  we rely upon estimated calculations as to the mineralized material on our properties 
since we have not conducted a feasibility study demonstrating proven or probable reserves  estimates of mineralized material presented in our press releases and regulatory filings contain less certainty than would be the case if the estimates were made in accordance with the sec recognized definition of proven or probable reserves 
until mineralized material is actually mined and processed  it must be considered an estimate only 
these estimates are imprecise and depend on geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis  which may prove to be unreliable 
we cannot assure you that these mineralized material estimates will be accurate or that this mineralized material can be mined or processed profitably and any decision to move forward with development is inherently risky 
any material changes in estimates of mineralized material will affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and such property s return on capital 
this risk is increased since we have not received a feasibility study on any of our properties 
there can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale metallurgical tests will be recovered at production scale 
these in place mineralized material estimates will be diluted in the mining process 
revenue from the sale of our metals concentrates may be adversely affected by loss or damage to the concentrate during shipment and storage at our buyer s facilities 
we rely on third party transportation companies to transport the concentrate to our buyer s facilities for processing and further refining 
the terms of our sales contract with the buyer require us to rely on assay results from samples of our concentrate that are obtained at the buyer s warehouse to determine the final sales value for our concentrates 
once the concentrate leaves our mill facility  we no longer have direct custody and control of these products 
theft or loss in transit or improper storage  fire  natural disasters  tampering or other unexpected events while at the buyer s location may lead to the loss of all or a portion of our concentrate products 
such losses may not be covered by insurance and may lead to a delay or interruption in our revenue and our operating results may be adversely affected 
tampering  theft or environmental factors may impact the metal content of our concentrates between the time they are sampled at our mill site for provisional price purposes and the time they are sampled at the buyer s warehouse for final price purposes and significant variances in these measurements may negatively impact our revenue 
the volatility of the price of gold and silver could adversely affect our future operations and  if warranted  our ability to develop our properties 
the profitability of our operations  the value of our properties and our ability to raise funding to conduct continued exploration and development  if warranted  are directly related to the market price of gold  silver and other metals 
the price of gold may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock 
our decision to put a mine into production and to commit the funds necessary for that purpose must be made long before the first revenue from production would be received 
a decrease in the price of gold and silver may prevent our properties from being economically mined or result in the write off of assets whose value is impaired as a result of lower gold or silver prices 
the volatility in gold and silver prices is illustrated by the following table  which sets forth for each of the past five calendar years  the average annual market prices in us dollars per ounce of gold and silver based on the daily london pm fix mineral gold silver the price of gold and silver is affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including inflation  fluctuation of the united states dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  the sale of gold and silver by central banks  and the political and economic conditions of major gold and silver producing countries throughout the world and accordingly no amount of planning or technical expertise can fully eliminate these risks 
in the event gold prices decline or remain low for prolonged periods of time  we might be unable to develop our properties  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial performance and cash flows 
we currently do not enter into forward sales  commodity  derivatives or hedging arrangements with respect to our gold and silver production and  as a result  we are exposed to the impact of any significant decrease in the price of gold or silver 
we sell the gold and silver we are producing at the prevailing market price 
currently  we do not enter into forward sales  commodity  derivative or hedging arrangements to establish a price in advance for the sale of future gold or silver production  although we may do so in the future 
as a result  we may realize the benefit of any short term increase in the gold or silver price  but we are not protected against decreases in the gold or silver price 
if the gold or silver price decreases significantly  our revenues may be materially adversely affected 
our current property portfolio is limited to a single producing property and our ability to remain profitable over the long term will depend on our ability to expand the known deposits like arista and or identify  explore and develop additional properties 
gold and silver properties are wasting assets 
they eventually become depleted or uneconomical to continue mining 
the acquisition of gold and silver properties and their exploration and development are subject to intense competition 
companies with greater financial resources  larger staff  more experience and more equipment for exploration and development may be in a better position than us to compete for such mineral properties 
if we are unable to find  develop  and economically mine new properties  we most likely will not be profitable on a long term basis and the price of our common stock may suffer 
our producing property is subject to a lease in favor of a third party which provides for royalties on production 
we lease a portion of our el aguila property from a third party 
the leased portion of the property provides for a net smelter return royalty of where production is sold in the form of gold silver dor and where production is sold in concentrate form 
all of our production to date has been from the leased property and processed and sold as concentrate 
the requirement to pay royalties to the owner of the concessions at our el aguila property  which includes the open pit mine and underground mine  will reduce our profitability from production of gold or other precious metals 
the construction and development of our underground mine and optimization and continued expansion and operation of our mill are subject to all of the risks inherent in construction development  and operations 
these risks include potential delays  cost overruns  shortages of material or labor  construction defects  breakdowns and injuries to persons and property 
we expect to engage a combination of american and mexican subcontractors and material suppliers in connection with the continued development of the el aguila project 
while we anticipate taking all measures which we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with construction and development of the underground mine and the operation of the mill  there is no assurance that the risks described above will not cause delays or cost overruns in connection with such construction or operation 
any delays would postpone our anticipated receipt of revenue and adversely affect our operations  which in turn may adversely affect the price of our stock 
our underground mining operations are subject to unique risks 
the exploration for minerals and the development and production of mining operations from an underground mine involve a high level of risk and are often affected by hazards outside of our control 
some of these risks include  but are not limited to  underground fires or floods  fall of ground accidents  seismic activity and unexpected geological formations or conditions including noxious fumes or gases 
the occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration  development  or production activities may result in the death of  or personal injury to  our employees  other personnel or third parties  the loss of mining equipment  damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities  monetary losses  deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production  environmental damage and potential legal liabilities  all of which may adversely affect our reputation  business  prospects  results of operations and financial position 
our operations are subject to permitting requirements which could require us to delay  suspend or terminate our operations 
our operations  including our ongoing exploration drilling program and production at the el aguila project  require permits from the mexican government 
if we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits  or if there is a delay in receiving future permits  our timetable and business plan will be adversely affected 
we have been named as a defendant in securities class action and shareholder lawsuits which could result in substantial damages and may divert management s time and attention from our business 
we and certain of our officers and directors are named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit  and in a shareholder derivative lawsuit  each filed in the us district court for the district of colorado and described in more detail in item legal proceedings 
these lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties  and the actual costs to be incurred relating to these lawsuits will depend upon many unknown factors 
the outcome of the litigation is necessarily uncertain  and we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these suits  and we may not prevail 
monitoring and defending against legal actions is time consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities 
in addition  we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with the litigation 
we are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from these matters  and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve the litigation or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay 
we have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to these lawsuits 
it is possible that we could  in the future  incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages 
a decision adverse to our interests on these actions could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  results of operations  financial position and stock price 
our properties are located in mexico and are subject to changes in political or economic conditions and regulations in that country 
all of our existing properties are located in mexico 
the risks with respect to mexico or other developing countries include  but are not limited to nationalization of properties  military repression  extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates  criminal activity  lack of personal safety or ability to safeguard property  labor instability or militancy  mineral title irregularities and high rates of inflation 
in addition  changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in mexico may adversely affect our business 
we may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation with respect to restrictions on production  price controls  export controls  income taxes  expropriation of property  maintenance of claims  environmental legislation  land use  land claims of local people  opposition from non governmental organizations  water use and mine safety 
the effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted but may adversely impact our proposed operations in any foreign jurisdiction 
changes in legislation affecting the mining industry could significantly affect our operations 
as in other countries  legislation has been introduced in mexico which would impose a royalty on production from mineral properties 
in the event any such legislation was successfully passed and signed into law  it could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations 
legislation relating to employee profit sharing in mexico was recently passed that could effectively increase mandated profit sharing distributions to our mine employees 
this legislation may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations and financial condition 
we do not insure against all of the risks to which we may be subject in our operations 
while we currently maintain insurance against general commercial liability claims and the physical assets at our el aguila project  we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks associated with our operations 
we might be subject to liability for environmental  pollution or other hazards associated with mineral exploration and development  which risks may not be insured against  which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or which we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons 
we may also not be insured against interruptions to our operations 
losses from these or other events may cause us to incur significant costs which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our property 
a significant loss could force us to reduce or terminate our operations 
our ability to develop our property is subject to the rights of the ejido local inhabitants to use the surface for agricultural purposes 
our ability to mine minerals is subject to maintaining satisfactory arrangements with the ejido for access and surface disturbances 
ejidos are groups of local inhabitants who were granted rights to conduct agricultural activities on the property 
we must negotiate and maintain a satisfactory arrangement with these residents in order to disturb or discontinue their rights to farm 
while we have successfully negotiated and signed such agreements related to the el aguila project  our inability to maintain these agreements or consummate similar agreements for new projects could impair or impede our ability to successfully mine the properties 
competition in the mining industry is intense  and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete 
competition in the mining industry for desirable properties  investment capital and personnel is intense 
numerous companies headquartered in the united states  canada and elsewhere throughout the world compete for properties on a global basis 
we are an insignificant participant in the gold mining industry due to our limited financial and personnel resources 
we presently operate with a limited number of personnel and we anticipate that we will compete with other companies in our industry to hire additional qualified personnel which will be required to successfully operate our mine and mill site 
we may be unable to attract the necessary investment capital or personnel to fully explore and if warranted  develop our properties and be unable to acquire other desirable properties 
we may require significant additional capital to fund our business plan 
we will be required to expend significant funds to determine if proven or probable mineral reserves exist at any of our properties  to continue exploration and if warranted  develop our existing properties and to identify and acquire additional properties to diversify our property portfolio 
we have spent and will be required to continue to expend significant amounts of capital for drilling  geological and geochemical analysis  assaying and feasibility studies with regard to the results of our exploration 
we may not benefit from these investments if we are unable to identify commercially exploitable mineralized material 
if we do locate commercially mineable material or decide to put additional properties into production  we may be required to upgrade our milling facility at the el aguila project or construct new facilities 
our ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes  in turn  depends upon a number of factors  including the status of the national and worldwide economy and the price of gold and other precious metals 
capital markets worldwide have been adversely affected by substantial losses by financial institutions  in turn caused by investments in asset backed securities 
we may not be successful in obtaining the required financing  or if we can obtain such financing  such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us 
failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further mining operations or exploration and development and the possible partial or total loss of our potential interest in our properties 
since most of our expenses are paid in mexican pesos  and we sell our production in united states dollars  we are subject to adverse changes in currency values that may adversely affect our results of operation 
our operations in the future could be affected by changes in the value of the mexican peso against the united states dollar 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies such as the peso against the us dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in us dollar terms in mexico  which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows 
conversely  depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in us dollar terms 
the value of cash and cash equivalents  and other monetary assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates 
our activities are subject to significant environmental regulations  which could raise the cost of doing business or adversely affect our ability to develop our properties 
our mining operations are subject to environmental regulation by semarnat  the environmental protection agency of mexico 
regulations governing development of new projects or significant changes to existing projects require that an environmental impact statement  known in mexico as a manifiestacion de impacto ambiental  be prepared by a third party contractor for submission to semarnat 
studies required to support this impact statement include a detailed analysis of many subject areas  including soil  water  vegetation  wildlife  cultural resources and socio economic impacts 
we may also be required to submit proof of local community support for a project to obtain final approval 
if an environmental impact statement is adverse or if we cannot obtain community support  our ability to develop our properties could be adversely affected 
significant environmental legislation exists in mexico  including fines and penalties for spills  release of emissions into the air  seepage and other environmental damage  which fines or penalties could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation 
our continuing reclamation obligations at the el aguila project and our other properties could require significant additional expenditures 
we are responsible for the reclamation obligations related to disturbances located on all of our properties  including the el aguila project 
we have reserved a liability on our balance sheet to cover the estimated amount of our reclamation obligation 
however  there is a risk that any reserve could be inadequate to cover the actual costs of reclamation when carried out 
continuing reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital 
there is a risk that we will be unable to fund these additional obligations  and further  that the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation requirements to such a degree that it would not be commercially reasonable to continue exploration activities  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial performance and cash flows 
the nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses 
exploration for and the production of minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses 
many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization  and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined 
our operations are  and any future development or mining operations we may conduct will be  subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and development of mineral properties  such as  but not limited to economically insufficient mineralized material  fluctuation in production costs that make mining uneconomical  labor disputes  unanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems  environmental hazards  water conditions  difficult surface or underground conditions  industrial accidents  metallurgic and other processing problems  mechanical and equipment performance problems  failure of pit walls or dams  unusual or unexpected rock formations  personal injury  fire  flooding  cave ins and landslides  and decrease in the value of mineralized material due to lower gold and silver prices 
any of these risks can materially and adversely affect  among other things  the development of properties  production quantities and rates  costs and expenditures  potential revenues and production dates 
we currently have limited insurance to guard against some of these risks 
if we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered  we would incur a write down of our investment in these interests 
all of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable  or result in additional expenses 
we depend upon a limited number of personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business 
due to the relatively limited number of personnel that we employ and our status as an exploration stage company  we are dependent on a limited number of individuals to run our business 
these individuals include our executive officers  including william and jason reid and brad blacketor  and to a lesser extent  our employees rick irvine and barry devlin 
if any of these individuals were to die  become disabled or leave our company  we would be forced to identify and retain individuals to replace them 
there is no assurance that we can find suitable individuals to replace them or to add to our employee base if that becomes necessary 
we have no life insurance on any individual  and we may be unable to hire a suitable replacement for them on favorable terms  should that become necessary 
in the event of a dispute regarding title to our property or any facet of our operations  it will likely be necessary for us to resolve the dispute in mexico  where we would be faced with unfamiliar laws and procedures 
the resolution of disputes in foreign countries can be costly and time consuming  similar to the situation in the united states 
however  in a foreign country  we face the additional burden of understanding unfamiliar laws and procedures 
we may not be entitled to a jury trial  as we might be in the united states 
further  to litigate in any foreign country  we would be faced with the necessity of hiring lawyers and other professionals who are familiar with the foreign laws 
for these reasons  we may incur unforeseen losses if we are forced to resolve a dispute in mexico or any other foreign country 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  and if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in our financial statements and our company  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
in order to provide reliable financial reports and operate successfully as a publicly traded company  we must maintain effective control over our financial reporting 
in connection with the restatement of certain interim financial statements during  we determined and reported to our external auditors there was an internal control deficiency in our concentrate sales process at march  and june  that did not prevent or detect on a timely basis the potential impact to concentrate sales that results from material variances between assays from concentrate samples taken at the mine site  and assays from samples taken at the buyer s warehouse  prior to final settlement with the buyer 
management concluded that concentrate sales should have been adjusted at the time the material assay differences were known  even though final settlement had not yet occurred 
we believe that this material weakness does not exist as of december  however  we can make no assurances that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may not subsequently arise 
if we fail to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  it could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations  result in material misstatements in our financial statements  restatement of financial statements  sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities  or loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our stock 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance  public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations 
keeping informed of  and in compliance with  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and accounting standards  including the sarbanes oxley act of and dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  as well as new and proposed sec regulations and accounting standards  has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources 
compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities 
the laws of the state of colorado and our articles of incorporation may protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits 
the laws of the state of colorado provide that our directors will not be liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors of the company 
our articles of incorporation permit us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law 
the exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing shareholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence  poor judgment or other circumstances 
the indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our directors and officers against claims  including claims arising out of their negligence  poor judgment  or other circumstances 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may be volatile and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment 
in addition to volatility associated with equity securities in general  the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock changes in the worldwide price for gold  disappointing results from our exploration or production efforts  producing at rates lower than those targeted  weather conditions  including unusually heavy rains  failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget  decline in demand for our common stock  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions  technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  investor perception of our industry or our prospects  and general economic trends 
in the last months  the price of our stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
in addition  stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as a result  you may be unable to resell your shares at a desired price 
past payments of dividends on our common stock are not indictors of future payments of dividends 
as of march   we have declared an instituted cash dividend on our common stock of per share per month 
however  our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend on a number of factors  including cash flow  development requirements and strategies  construction projects  spot gold and silver prices and taxation and general market conditions 
further  a portion of our cash flow will likely be retained to finance our operations 
any material change in our operations may affect future dividends which may be modified at the discretion of our board of directors 
any decrease in our monthly dividend would likely have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock 
the sale of common stock by certain of our shareholders may depress the price of our common stock due to the limited trading market which exists 
due to a number of factors  including our stage of development and the past history of our common stock trading in the over the counter securities market prior to becoming listed on a national securities exchange  the trading volume in our common stock has been limited 
trading over the last days has averaged approximately  shares per day 
the sale of a significant amount of common stock by our principal shareholders  including hochschild mining holdings limited  may depress the price of our common stock 
as a result  you may lose all or a part of your investment 
a small number of existing shareholders own a significant amount of our common stock  which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote 
our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately of our common stock and our largest shareholder owns approximately of our common stock as of march  under our articles of incorporation and colorado law  the vote of a majority of the shares outstanding is generally required to approve most shareholder action 
as a result  this group may be able to influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future  including votes concerning the election of directors  amendments to our articles of incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
we have no existing agreements or plans for mergers or other corporate transactions that would require a shareholder vote at this time 
however  you should be aware that you may have limited ability to influence the outcome of any vote in the future 
we are subject to the continued listing criteria of the nyse mkt and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock 
our common stock is currently listed on the nyse mkt 
in order to maintain the listing  we must maintain certain share prices  financial and share distribution targets  including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders equity and a minimum number of public shareholders 
in addition to objective standards  the nyse mkt may delist the securities of any issuer if  in its opinion  the issuer s financial condition and or operating results appear unsatisfactory  if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the nyse mkt inadvisable  if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company  if an issuer fails to comply with the nyse mkt s listing requirements  if an issuer s common stock sells at what the nyse mkt considers a low selling price and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the nyse mkt  or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the nyse mkt  in its opinion  inadvisable 
if the nyse mkt delists our common stock  investors may face material adverse consequences  including  but not limited to  a lack of trading market for our securities  reduced liquidity  decreased analyst coverage of our securities  and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations 
issuances of our stock in the future could dilute existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have the authority to issue up to  shares of common stock   shares of preferred stock  and also to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval 
as of march   there were  shares of common stock outstanding 
future issuances of our securities could be at prices substantially below the price paid for our common stock by our current shareholders 
in addition  we can issue blocks of our common stock in amounts up to of the then outstanding shares without further shareholder approval 
because we experience lower trading volume in our common stock than many of our larger peers  the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may have a disproportionately large impact on our share price compared to larger companies 
our awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect 
a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common stock 
if the price of our common stock performs poorly  such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel 
in addition  any changes made to our stock option policies  or to any other of our compensation practices  which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel

item properties we classify our mineral properties into two categories operating properties and exploration properties 
operating properties are properties on which we operate a producing mine and are what we consider a material property in accordance with guide we currently have an interest in six properties  including one operating property and five exploration properties  in the southern state of oaxaca  mexico 
all of the properties are located in what is known as the san jose structural corridor  which runs north west 
our properties comprise continuous kilometers of this structural corridor  which spans three historic mining districts in oaxaca 
the map below shows the general location of our six properties c users jessica appdata local microsoft windows temporary internet files content 
word oaxaca state project map 
jpg operating properties the el aguila project background the el aguila project currently comprises mining concessions aggregating  hectares as described in the table below acquisition date concession names hectares acquisition el aguila and el aire lease  subject to royalty el chacal and el pilon  lease  subject to royalty el pitayo  el talaje  el coyote  el zarrito  san luis and la curva concession holder effective october   we leased el aguila  el aire and la tehuana  from a former consultant to our company 
the el aguila and el aire concessions are part of the el aguila project and the la tehuana concession comprises the las margaritas property 
the el aguila lease agreement is subject to a net smelter return royalty where production is sold in the form of gold silver dore and for production sold in concentrate form 
subject to meeting minimum exploration requirements  there is no expiration term for the lease 
we may terminate it at any time upon written notice to the lessor and the lessor may terminate it if we fail to fulfill any of our obligations  which primarily consists of paying the appropriate royalty to the lessor 
in  we subsequently acquired from our former consultant  at no additional cost  the el chacal and el pilon concessions  which are subject to a royalty  but are not subject to the el aguila lease agreement 
we filed for and received additional concessions from the mexican government which are also not part of the concessions leased or acquired from our former consultant 
the mineral concessions making up the el aguila project are located within the san pedro totolapam ejido 
as described in more detail in mining concessions and regulations below  we are required to pay concession fees to the mexican government to maintain our interest in these concessions  including the concessions which are subject to the lease agreement with our former consultant 
we paid approximately  during in maintenance fees to the mexican government for the concessions comprising el aguila project 
location and access the el aguila project is located in the sierra madre del sur mountains of southern mexico  in the central part of the state of oaxaca 
the property is located along a major paved highway approximately kilometers miles southeast of oaxaca city  the state s capital city 
at the village of san jose de gracia  the property is approximately four kilometers due northwest from the village 
we have constructed gravel and paved road from the village to the mine and mill sites which supports adequate access to the property by small and large vehicles 
the climate of the el aguila project area is dry and warm to very warm with most rainfall occurring in the summer and annual precipitation averaging only mm inches 
the average yearly temperature is degrees centigrade f 
the area is very rocky with scarce vegetation 
subsistence farming occurs and the main agricultural crop is agave cactus that is cultivated for the production of mescal 
geology and mineralization the el aguila project is located in the san jose de gracia mining district in oaxaca 
multiple volcanic domes of various scales  and probably non vented intrusive domes  dominate the district geology 
these volcanogenic features are imposed on a pre volcanic basement of sedimentary rocks 
gold and silver mineralization in this district is related to the manifestations of this classic volcanogenic system and is considered epithermal in character 
there are no known reserves at el aguila  within the definition of the sec guide  and we have proceeded to commercially mine the property absent a feasibility study that would indicate any proven or probable reserves 
as discussed in more detail below  we have produced metal concentrates from two locations on the el aguila property  the open pit mine el aguila open pit and the underground mine at the la arista vein system 
the el aguila open pit mineralization is considered low sulfidation  epithermal mineralization of gold and silver with no base metals 
the la arista vein system is considered intermediate epithermal mineralization of gold  silver  copper  lead  and zinc 
the host rock at the la arista vein system is primarily andesite 
facilities we constructed a mill facility and infrastructure at the el aguila project for approximately million  which was completed in the mill is flexible in its ability to process several types of mineralization 
it has a differential flotation section capable of processing polymetallic ores and producing up to three separate concentrate products for sale  and an agitated leach circuit capable of producing gold and silver dore for sale 
depending on the specific ore type and characteristics  the mill  as it is presently configured  can process a nominal  tonnes of ore per year 
power is provided by diesel generators at the site 
we obtained water rights from the mexican government for an amount of water we believe is sufficient to meet our operating requirements and pump it approximately five kilometers to the site from a permitted well located near the totolapam river 
additional improvements we have made at the site include an access road from the major highway  a water line and pumping station  haul roads from the mine site to the mill  constructing buildings adjacent to the mill facility for office space and an assay lab and a tailings impoundment and other infrastructure 
in october  we acquired an additional parcel of land which is approximately five hectares in size and adjacent to the community of san jose de gracia 
the land cost us  we have completed construction of an employee housing facility on this parcel for approximately million that includes buildings and houses approximately people 
exploration activities the early history of activity at the el aguila project property  as known by us  is prospecting and limited mining for gold and silver from the early s to the mid s 
in  the concessions were leased to apex silver corporation of denver  colorado 
apex carried out an exploration program involving geologic mapping  surface sampling and an hole drilling program  meters  or  feet 
the results did not meet apex s expectations so it cancelled its lease on the property in we leased the property from our former consultant in october in august  we commenced an initial drilling and exploration program 
through  we have drilled a total of core holes equaling  meters and reverse circulation holes equaling  meters for a total of holes totaling  meters  feet 
exploration at the el aguila project includes drilling the el aguila open pit mineralization and drilling the el aire vein system mineralization and the discovery and subsequent detailed drilling of the la arista vein system 
the la arista vein system is made up of two primary veins  the baja vein and the arista vein which are approximately meters apart but also include multiple near parallel veins of varying length 
the drilling of the la arista vein system has shown mineralized material over meters of strike length and meters of depth 
both veins are open along strike and depth 
surface drilling at el aguila in was mainly a continuation of the previous year s activities of infill and step out drilling from the mine 
in  surface diamond drill holes totaling  meters  feet were completed on the el aguila project 
new significant high grade mineralization was encountered in holes with drill intercepts including grams per tonne gold and grams per tonne silver over a core length of meters and grams per tonne gold and  grams per tonne silver over a core length of meters 
other surface prospecting work consisted of field geological  structural and alteration mapping  geochemical sampling and a ground geophysical survey 
the ground geophysical survey was carried out over the area of the mine and the area to the west and southwest 
this survey generated a number of target areas that are marked for future drilling 
in  we anticipate spending approximately million for exploration at el aguila  consisting of approximately million for drilling   for geochemical surveys and  for geophysical exploration  including an airborne magnetic and radiometric survey of all of our properties which was delayed from we anticipate that all exploration activities will be funded from working capital 
operating activities we declared commercial production at the el aguila project july  mineral production during consisted of processing ore from the el aguila open pit located approximately kilometers from the mill 
mining of the open pit ore was essentially completed in and there remained a lower grade stockpile of open pit ore approximating  tonnes for future processing at the end of during  we began developing an underground mine to access two veins we named the la arista and baja veins  which we refer to as the la arista vein system 
the underground mine is approximately two kilometers from the mill 
we have constructed a primary decline ramp and that reached level  approximately meters below the portal  at december  we have also constructed a safety ventilation decline ramp in conjunction with the primary decline ramp along with various drifts and stopes 
during  we continued underground mining of the la arista ore at our el aguila project and the main production areas were from level to mine development and preparation occurred on levels to several factors contributed to the challenges we encountered with production from la arista during  including higher than planned dilution in our long hole stopes  mining of lower grade vein margins and splays and continued development and infrastructure needs in the mine related to abatement of water inflow at lower levels along with required ventilation upgrades to reduce carbon dioxide levels associated with the increased water flows 
to remediate these issues we installed additional water pumping stations and upgraded the underground mine ventilation system with several new vent fans 
we began transitioning from processing the open pit ore to the underground ore at our mill facilities in march in  we processed underground ore through the mill at an average of tonnes of ore per day and totaled  tonnes for the year  with an average grade of grams per tonne gold and grams per tonne silver 
all of our processing is taking place using the mill s flotation circuit  as we have not yet utilized the mill s agitated leach circuit 
we anticipate we would use the agitated leach circuit if ever we are able to mine sufficient ore from either the el rey or las margaritas properties or any other property with potential oxide ore 
please see the table titled production and sales statistics el aguila project in item management s discussion and analysis for additional details concerning our mineral production statistics for and exploration properties we currently hold an interest in five additional properties in oaxaca  which we classify as exploration properties 
we do not currently consider any of these properties to be a material property for purposes of guide and none of these properties has any known reserves 
we anticipate all exploration activities at these properties will be funded through our working capital 
the el rey property the el rey property consists of concessions in another area in the state of oaxaca known as el rey  el virrey  la reyna and el marquez 
we acquired the el rey concession from our former consultant and it is subject to a net smelter return royalty payable to him on a portion of the claims 
we obtained the remaining concessions by staking claims and filing for concessions with the mexican government 
these concessions total  hectares and we are required to pay concession maintenance fees semi annually to the mexican government to maintain the claims 
we paid  in maintenance fees for the concessions comprising el rey property in the el rey property is approximately kilometers miles from the el aguila project 
there is no plant or equipment on the el rey property 
if exploration is successful  any mining would probably require an underground mine but any mineralized material could be trucked to the el aguila project mill for processing 
limited drilling at el rey has encountered gold and silver mineralization up to meter of grams per tonne gold ounces per tonne and meters of grams per tonne silver 
the mineralized material has been located within meters from the surface 
to date  we have drilled core holes for a total of  meters  feet at the el rey property 
early in  we completed a small amount of work to finish refurbishing and extending an existing shaft on the property to permit underground exploratory drilling 
we ceased work at el rey during following a request to obtain additional approvals from local community agencies 
we continue to work with the local agencies and anticipate resolving the matter  but we have no assurance we will be able to resume our exploration activities in the near term 
if the matter is resolved  we will conduct follow up drilling and exploration based on the drilling done in  and have budgeted million for that purpose in that event 
it is anticipated that el rey will be included in our anticipated airborne geophysical survey 
the las margaritas property the las margaritas property is made up of the la tehuana concession 
we leased this concession in october from our former consultant along with two of the concessions comprising the el aguila property and the terms of this agreement are discussed under the el aguila project above 
it is comprised of approximately hectares located adjacent to the el aguila project 
we are also required to pay concession maintenance fees semi annually to the mexican government to maintain this claim and we paid  in maintenance fees during in  we conducted a geochemical stream sediment sampling program on las margaritas 
a total of samples were collected 
six rock samples were also collected from this property and submitted for fluid inclusion study 
the result of this survey indicated a number of areas were appropriate for further investigation by diamond drilling from surface 
we completed a series of access roads after consultation with the local community to help facilitate the drill program 
in  fifteen surface diamond drill holes totaling  meters  feet were completed on the las margaritas property 
high grade mineralization was encountered with drill intercepts including grams per tonne gold and  grams per tonne silver over a core length of meters 
in  drilling will continue at las margaritas to test various structural and mineralized exploration targets and we have budgeted approximately  for this purpose 
the alta gracia property in august  we acquired claims adjacent to the las margaritas property in the alta gracia mining district by filing concessions known as the david  the david and la hurradura  totaling  hectares 
we refer to this property as the alta gracia property 
we are required to pay concession maintenance fees to the mexican government semi annually in order to maintain these claims and we paid  in annual fees during during  we conducted surface sampling and geologic mapping at alta gracia 
our rock chip samples and other geologic field work have identified several structural targets containing gold and silver mineralization  including three high grade polymetallic veins that outcrop on the surface near some historic workings 
during and  we identified multiple drill targets 
we also conducted a small amount of underground exploration by driving drifts and crosscuts into exposed veins 
in  we completed a preliminary drill program consisting of twelve surface diamond drill holes totaling  meters  feet 
drill results were encouraging and will be assessed in to help plan further drilling campaigns 
in addition  detailed mapping and sampling will be required to assess the resource potential of alta gracia to determine if mine development is warranted 
we will also conduct additional metallurgical test work to determine the amenability of the ore at our el aguila processing facility 
we have no established timetable for our exploration activities at alta gracia and any additional exploration activities conducted in will be included as part of the exploration budget for el aguila 
the el chamizo property in june  we staked mineral claims between the el rey property and alta gracia property and acquired an exploration concession from the mexican government of approximately  hectares square miles referred to as el chamizo 
we are required to pay maintenance fees to the mexican government semi annually to maintain these claims and we paid approximately  in maintenance fees during in march  we acquired a concession known as cerro colorado from almaden minerals  ltd 
consisting of approximately  hectares 
the cerro colorado concession is surrounded by our el chamizo concession and we include it as part of the el chamizo property 
any future production from the cerro colorado concession is subject to a net smelter return royalty in favor of almaden 
because of the close proximity of el chamizo to alta gracia  exploration activity began on this property during late and to date has been limited to geochemical sampling and drilling of eight shallow core holes for a total of  meters  feet 
no significant work was conducted at el chamizo during in  exploration on the property will include the property wide airborne geophysical survey and additional geochemical sampling  which is included in the exploration budget for el aguila 
el fuego property in march  we acquired two concessions from almaden minerals ltd 
for  cash subject to a net smelter return royalty 
the cerro colorado concession is surrounded by our el chamizo property and included as part of this property as discussed above 
the el fuego concession consists of approximately  hectares and is located south of our alta gracia and el chamizo property along the san jose structural corridor 
we will be required to pay maintenance fees to the mexican government semi annually to maintain this claim during we currently do not anticipate conducting exploration activities on el fuego during  however  it will be included in the property wide airborne geophysical survey 
the solaga property we leased a interest in a property we refer to as the solaga property  which is comprised of two mining concessions totaling hectares known as solaga i and solaga ii in february located approximately kilometers miles northeast of the el aguila project 
in early  we terminated our interest in this lease  which was subject to a net smelter return royalty on any production and required an annual minimum advance royalty payment of  if production had not commenced by we paid the minimum advance royalty to the lessor in  and in accordance with the lease 
we also paid  in maintenance fees for solaga during mining concessions and regulations mineral rights in mexico belong to the mexican federal government and are administered pursuant to article of the mexican constitution 
all of our mining concessions are exploitation concessions  which may be granted or transferred to mexican citizens and corporations 
our leases or concessions are held by our mexican subsidiaries 
exploitation concessions have a term of years and can be renewed for another years 
concessions grant us the right to explore and exploit all minerals found in the ground 
maintenance of concessions requires the semi annual payment of mining duties due in january and july and the performance of assessment work  on a calendar year basis  with assessment work reports required to be filed in the month of may for the preceding calendar year 
the amount of mining duties and annual assessment are set by regulation and may increase over the life of the concession and include periodic adjustments for inflation 
mining concessions are registered at the public registry of mining in mexico city and in regional offices in mexico 
mexican mining law does not require payment of finder s fees or royalties to the government  except for a discovery premium in connection with national mineral reserves  concessions and claims or allotments contracted directly from the mexican geological survey 
none of the claims held by any of our subsidiaries are under such a discovery premium regime 
ejido lands and surface right acquisitions surface lands at our oaxaca mining properties are ejido lands agrarian cooperative lands granted by the federal government to groups of campesinos pursuant to article of the mexican constitution of 
prior to january   ejidos could not transfer ejido lands into private ownership 
amendments to article of the mexican constitution in now allow individual property ownership within ejidos and allow ejidos to enter into commercial ventures with individuals or entities  including foreign corporations 
we have an agreement with the local san pedro totolapam ejido allowing exploration and exploitation of mineralization at the el aguila project and our surrounding properties 
mexican law recognizes mining as a land use generally superior to agricultural 
however  the law also recognizes the rights of the ejidos to compensation in the event mining activity interrupts or discontinues their use of the agricultural lands 
compensation is typically made in the form of a cash payment to the holder of the agricultural rights 
the amount of such compensation is generally related to the perceived value of the agricultural rights as negotiated in the first instance between the ejidos and the owner of the mineral rights 
if the parties are unable to reach agreement on the amount of the compensation  the decision will be referred to the government 
we have established surface rights agreements with the san pedro totolapam ejido and the individuals impacted by our proposed operations which allow disturbance of the surface where necessary for our exploration activities and mining operations 
office facilities we maintain offices in oaxaca and in colorado 
we constructed an administrative office building adjacent to the mill site as part of the facilities at the el aguila project 
we also lease office space in oaxaca city  oaxaca consisting of approximately  square feet 
the lease commenced in for ten years at approximately  per month 
in  we purchased a building in colorado springs  colorado  containing approximately  square feet which serves as our executive and administrative headquarters 
we also established a small satellite office in denver  colorado in consisting of approximately  square feet  which we leased for three years at approximately  per month

introduction the following discussion summarizes our results of operations for three fiscal years ended december  and our financial condition at december  and  with a particular emphasis on the year ended december  the discussion also presents certain non gaap financial measures that are important to management in its evaluation of our operating results and which are used by management to compare our performance with what we perceive to be peer group mining companies and relied on as part of management s decision making process 
management believes these measures may also be important to investors in evaluating our performance 
for a detailed description of each of the non gaap financial measures  please see the discussion under non gaap measures below 
overview business we are a mining company that pursues gold and silver projects that are expected to have low operating costs and high returns on capital 
we are presently focused on mineral production at the el aguila project in oaxaca  mexico 
we achieved commercial production in july at our el aguila open pit mine with a metal concentrate containing our primary product of gold and a silver by product 
operations at the el aguila open pit mine ceased in february with the start up of mine operations at the la arista underground mine in march our la arista underground mine produces metal concentrates that contain our primary metal products of gold and silver  and by products of copper  lead and zinc 
the mill located at our el aguila project produced a total of  precious metal gold equivalent ounces for the year ended december   which was within our revised target mill production of  to  precious metal gold equivalent ounces 
during this period  we sold  of precious metal gold equivalent ounces at a total cash cost including royalties of per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold 
precious metal gold equivalent is determined by taking the silver ounces produced or sold and converting them to precious metal gold equivalent ounces using the gold to silver average price ratio 
the gold and silver average prices used are the actual metal prices realized from the sales of our metals concentrate 
please see the section titled non gaap measures below for additional information concerning the cash cost per ounce measure 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of million  mine gross profit of million and net income of million 
although our annual mill production increased over the prior year  we encountered several challenges with production at la arista during  including higher than planned mining dilution in our long hole stopes  mining of lower grade vein margins and splays  continued development and infrastructure needs in the mine related to abatement of water inflow at lower levels and ventilation upgrades to reduce carbon dioxide levels 
in order to adequately address these issues in  our new on site management team has taken a more proactive development approach to mitigate effects of water and carbon dioxide gas including some off vein development  construction of additional ventilation fans providing fresh air to the mine and additional water pumping stations 
exploration stage company we are considered an exploration stage company under the sec criteria since we have not demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at our el aguila project in oaxaca  mexico or any of our other properties 
accordingly  as required by the sec guidelines see note to the consolidated financial statements and us gaap for companies in the exploratory stage  substantially all of our investment in mining properties to date  including construction of the mill  mine facilities and mine development expenditures  have been expensed and therefore do not appear as assets on our balance sheet 
certain expenditures  such as expenses for rolling stock or other general purpose equipment  may be capitalized  subject to our evaluation of the possible impairment of the asset 
our characterization as an exploration stage company regarding the treatment of construction and development expenditures as an operating expense rather than as a capital expenditure  has caused us to report larger losses in and lower net income in and than if we had capitalized the expenditures 
additionally  we will not have a corresponding depreciation or amortization expense for these costs going forward since they are expensed as incurred rather than capitalized 
although the majority of the capital expenditures for the el aguila project were completed between and  we expect underground mine construction to continue in future years and we will be completing additional capital improvements at our el aguila mill during and future years 
in comparison to other mining companies that capitalize development expenditures because they have exited the exploration stage  we may report larger losses or lesser profits as a result of this ongoing construction  which will be expensed instead of capitalized for accounting purposes 
we expect to remain as an exploration stage company for the foreseeable future  even though we have reached commercial production 
we will not exit the exploration stage until such time  if ever  that we demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves that meet the sec guidelines 
likewise  unless mineralized material is classified as proven or probable reserves  substantially all expenditures for mine and mill construction have been or will be expensed as incurred 
exploration activities during  we continued to focus primarily on infill and step out drilling at the la arista underground mine  located at the el aguila project 
because this drilling is used to define the mineralization and to assist in mining of the ore at the underground mine  these expenses are considered development and delineation of the ore body not exploration  and these costs are classified as construction and development in the consolidated statements of operations 
exploration activities that are classified as exploration expenses in the consolidated statements of operations include  but are not limited to  drilling on other areas of the el aguila property to test new geologic targets and exploration work on our other properties 
exploration during included commencing a surface drill program on portions of the las margaritas property  we also are completing a limited drilling campaign at alta gracia and el chamizo focusing on previously identified drill targets 
physical dividend program in april  we launched a physical dividend program pursuant to which our shareholders have the option to convert the cash dividends we pay into physical gold and silver bullion 
as part of our overall strategy to diversify our treasury and to facilitate this program  we purchase gold and silver bullion 
in order for a shareholder to convert their cash dividend into physical gold and or silver  the shareholder must opt in to the physical dividend program and request the conversion of their cash dividend  or any portion thereof  into physical gold and or silver 
for those shareholders who elect to convert their cash dividend into gold and or silver bullion  the gold and silver will be delivered in the form of gold silver one ounce bullion rounds 
no action is required by any shareholder who elects not to participate in the physical metals program 
for those shareholders who wish to convert any portion of their cash dividend into gold and or silver bullion  the process is summarized as follows shareholders must register and hold their gold resource corporation common shares in their name directly with our transfer agent  computershare investor services  and not through a brokerage house or other intermediary 
this is a requirement so that we can locate and validate the shareholder s position in our common stock 
shareholders must set up an individual account with gold bullion international gbi  liberty street new york  ny gbi facilitates the cash to gold and silver conversion 
shareholders then direct their cash dividend check issued by computershare to be electronically sent to that shareholder s gbi account for the option to have it  or any portion thereof that denominates into a one ounce gold or silver bullion round 
the election to convert all or any portion of the shareholder s cash dividend into bullion is governed by an agreement between the shareholder and gbi 
shareholders with accounts at gbi who wish to change their current gold  silver or cash allocations for their cash dividend must do so by midnight edt on the date preceding the monthly dividend record date 
we issue a press release with details of each dividend declaration  and the dividend record and payment dates 
on the dividend record date  the number of bullion ounces to be converted and distributed to the shareholder s individual account on the dividend payment date is calculated as the dollar value of that portion of the cash dividend the shareholder elected to convert to bullion  divided by the london bullion market pm gold fix on the record date or the london bullion market silver fix on the record date 
only whole ounces of gold and silver bullion are credited to a shareholder s individual account on the dividend payment date 
the cash value attributable to fractional ounces will remain in the shareholder s individual account as cash until such time as future dividends provide the shareholder with sufficient cash to convert to whole ounces of gold or silver based on the london pm gold fix and silver fix on a future dividend record date  and based on the shareholder s self directed gold  silver or cash allocations in effect at that time 
the shareholder may also choose to move their cash out of their gbi account 
shareholders cannot move cash into their gbi account for conversion into gold and silver 
only the shareholder s cash dividend sent from computershare is eligible for conversion 
during the year ended december   we purchased approximately  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver at market prices for a total cost of million 
during the year ended december   we purchased approximately ounces of gold and  ounces of silver at market prices for a total cost of million 
settlement with concentrate buyer on november   we entered into a settlement agreement with our concentrate buyer as a result of the dispute over the metallurgical content of the concentrates sampled at buyer s facility after discovering issues related to the transportation  handling  control and sampling of those concentrates  and the resulting assays that were obtained from those samples 
we believe the concentrates had been tampered with and compromised sometime after the shipments left the mine site and until the concentrates were sampled at the buyer s warehouse 
the settlement agreement required the buyer to pay us million  representing the amount by which our provisional invoices for april  may and june exceeded the tentative settlement value  based on assays taken at the buyer s warehouse 
in addition  the settlement agreement required us to accept the final settlement value  based on assays taken at the buyer s warehouse  for shipments made in february and march the settlement resulted in a reduction to precious metal gold equivalent sold of approximately  ounces and a net reduction to sales of metal concentrates of million  which included assay  pricing and other settlement adjustments with the buyer  for the six months ended june  these adjustments were recorded in the restated first and second quarter financial statements 
other events in april  the board of directors increased the instituted monthly dividend payment from per share to per share 
prior to instituting a regular monthly dividend in august  the dividends were characterized as special dividends 
our long term goal is to distribute approximately one third of our cash flow from mine site operations see non gaap measures as dividends to shareholders 
in  we distributed approximately of cash flow from mine site operations in shareholder dividends 
in  we distributed approximately of cash flow from mine site operations to our shareholders as dividends 
our dividends should not be considered a prediction or guarantee of future dividends 
our instituted dividend may be modified or discontinued at the discretion of our board of directors  depending on variables such as  but not limited to  operating cash flow  development requirements and strategies  construction projects  spot gold and silver prices  taxation and general market conditions 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales of metals concentrate  net during the year ended december   we generated sales of million  net of treatment charges  compared to sales of million during the same period of  an increase of 
the significant increase in sales for the year ended december  resulted from an increase in payable metals sold due to an increase in tonnes milled in at the la arista underground mine 
fewer ore tonnes were milled and payable metals sold in  principally due to operations at la arista not commencing until march revenue generated from sale of base metals contained in our concentrates is considered a by product of our gold and silver production 
see production and sales statistics tables titled la arista underground mine and el aguila open pit mine below for additional information regarding the three months and years ended december  and 
the year ended was our second full year of commercial production 
metals prices realized in were mixed over the prior year  with average per ounce gold prices increasing to  from  per ounce  a increase  and average per ounce silver prices decreasing to from per ounce  a decrease 
below are certain key operating statistics for our la arista underground mine for and and the el aguila open pit mine for our production for consisted of ore from our la arista underground mine 
our production for consisted of ore from both the la arista underground mine and the el aguila open pit mine 
production for the three months ended december  did not include ore from the el aguila open pit mine  which ceased operations in february  but it did include ore from the la arista underground mine  which began operations in march our production rate at la arista is directly a result of mine development and the establishment of sufficient stopes and working faces 
the number of stopes and working faces has increased as we have gone deeper in the mine  which has resulted in more tonnes of ore processed at the mill in as compared to we also sustained  at various times  higher than expected mining dilution rates as high as to in the second quarter of as well as higher than targeted dilution rates at various times in the remaining quarters 
this dilution lowers the head grades 
we believe this to be an unacceptable dilution percentage and we continue to take steps to lower dilution

silver ounces were considered a by product in arriving at the total cash cost per ounce equivalent 
for the year ended december   we sold  ounces gold and  ounces silver from the la arista underground mine for at gross sales value of approximately million and million  respectively 
this compares to  ounces gold and  ounces silver during from both the la arista underground mine and el aguila open pit mine  for gross sales value of million and million respectively 
from the el aguila open pit mine  we sold  ounces gold and  ounces silver during the first two months of and from the la arista underground mine  we sold  ounces gold and  ounces silver during the last ten months of the increase in sales in principally resulted from a full year of operations at la arista in  versus ten months of operations at la arista in production for the year ended december  mill production totaled  ounces of precious metal gold equivalent compared to  ounces of precious metal gold equivalent for see the table titled production and sales statistics el aguila project above for additional information regarding our mineral production statistics 
we continue to focus on mining and development activities at the la arista underground mine 
our production is dependent on the rate of mine development and the establishment of sufficient stopes and working faces 
we anticipate the number of stopes and working faces will increase in and that precious metal mill production may be similar with mill production 
our mine plan anticipates that we will be mining areas of the deposit that contain higher levels of base metals  as compared to we are targeting mill production of  to  ounces of precious metal gold equivalent in mine gross profit 
for the year ended december  mine gross profit totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in mine gross profit from the prior year was primarily due to the increase in sales of metal concentrate due to an increase in the quantities of payable metal sold 
mine gross profit as a percent of sales for the year ended december  decreased to from during the same period in  principally due to higher labor  contractor services  diesel  concentrate transportation and other operating costs in net income loss before extraordinary item 
for the year ended december   net income before extraordinary item was million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income before extraordinary item of million or per diluted share  for the comparable period of the million decrease in net income in was principally attributable to a million income tax benefit in resulting from a reduction to the income tax valuation allowance  as compared to million of income tax expense in costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses during the year ended december  were million compared to million during the comparable period of  an increase of million  or 
the increase resulted from an increase in general and administrative expenses  and exploration expenses  which were partially offset by a decrease in construction and development expenses  as discussed in more detail below 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same periods of the million increase in principally resulted from higher stock based compensation expense  investor relations activities  professional services and insurance costs 
exploration expenses 
property exploration expenses totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million during the same period of the million increase in exploration expenses results from higher expenditures in to evaluate and drill new exploration targets on the el aguila and alta gracia properties  and to evaluate other prospects near our la arista underground mine 
we also set up an exploration office in turkey in september exploration costs associated with definition and delineation drilling of the la arista vein system are reflected in construction and development expenses 
construction and development expenses 
construction and development expenses during the year ended december  decreased to million from million during construction and development includes mine development costs attributable to definition and delineation drilling of the la arista vein system  and construction related activities at the el aguila project 
the million decrease when compared to is due to lower expenditures in relating to construction of the tailings dam  expansion of the flotation cells in the flotation circuit in the mill  construction of the mine camp and infrastructure construction 
we will continue to focus on further mine development of la arista and construction related activities at the el aguila project for the foreseeable future 
other expense income 
for the year ended december   we recorded other expense of million  compared to other income of million during the same period of the change in other expense income resulted primarily from recognizing a foreign currency loss of million during the year ended december  compared to a foreign currency gain of million in the comparable period in the current year losses resulted from currency translation adjustments during a period when the dollar was increasing compared to the mexican peso  and a million reclassification from other comprehensive loss to foreign exchange loss 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   income tax provision was million as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the million increase in income tax provision in principally resulted from a million reduction to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in as compared to a million reduction to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in there was no corresponding income tax provision or benefit during the due to start up of operations in as of december   there were no remaining valuation allowances on the company s deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
extraordinary item 
on april   the el aguila project suffered severe damage from an anomalous rain and hail storm which flooded the la arista underground mine and damaged existing roads  buildings and equipment 
we experienced a loss of million  for which we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  net of income tax benefit of million  for the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the year ended december  we sold  ounces of gold at an average realized price of  per ounce for million of gross revenue  and  ounces of silver at an average realized price of per ounce for approximately million of gross revenue  compared to  ounces of gold at an average realized price of  per ounce for million of gross revenues  and  ounces of silver at an average realized price of per ounce for approximately million of gross revenue for mine gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the comparable period of  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to a full twelve months of mine operations in compared to only six months of operations in for the year ended december  we reported a net income of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  our net income increased in due to ramp up of operations in as compared to a full year of operations in total costs and expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the comparable period of  an increase of million or 
the increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to our operations transitioning to underground mine development activities and an increase in stock based compensation 
exploration expense for the year ended december  of million was consistent with our level of exploration activity in of million 
construction and development for the year ended december  of million increased by million or when compared to of the higher cost in was primarily due to the completion of the second phase of the tailings dam  and expansion of the flotation cells in the mill s flotation circuit during general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable period in the increase was attributable to increases in professional fees  salaries and benefits and stock based compensation 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a currency translation adjustment loss of million and a currency translation adjustment gain of million  respectively  resulting from the translation of our subsidiary s mexican peso denominated functional currency financial statements into the us dollar reporting currency 
non gaap measures throughout this report  we have provided information prepared or calculated according to us gaap  as well as provided some us gaap non gaap performance measures 
because the non gaap performance measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap  they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
accordingly  these measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 
total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold we use total cash cost including royalties per gold equivalent ounce sold  calculated in accordance with the gold institute s standard  as one indicator for comparative monitoring of our mining operations from period to period and believe that investors also find this information helpful when evaluating our performance 
total cash costs are arrived at by taking mine cost of sales  plus treatment and refining charges which are netted against revenues  less by product credits earned from sales of metals we consider by products copper  lead and zinc at the la arista underground mine and silver at the el aguila open pit mine less noncash items such as depreciation and amortization  accretion  stock based compensation  and reclamation costs 
total cash costs are divided by gold equivalent ounces sold gold ounces sold  plus gold equivalent ounces of silver ounces sold converted to gold ounces using our realized gold price per ounce to silver price per ounce ratio  at the la arista underground mine  and gold ounces sold at the el aguila open pit mine to arrive at total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold 
there can be no assurance that our reporting of this non gaap measure is similar to that reported by other mining companies 
for reporting periods prior to  we reported cash operating cost per gold equivalent ounce produced on site mill production 
these amounts have been restated in this management s discussion and analysis to reflect our current reporting method  of total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold  which we believe is the most common method used by companies that apply the gold institute standard 
the principal difference between cash operating costs and total cash costs is that cash operating costs exclude royalty costs  whereas total cash costs include royalty costs 
our concentrates are subject to a net smelter returns royalty 
the principal difference between gold equivalent ounces produced at the mill and gold equivalent ounces sold  is that gold equivalent ounces produced at the mill do not reflect payable metal deductions levied by smelters  whereas gold equivalent ounces sold are after payable metal deductions levied by smelters 
we have reconciled total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold to reported us gaap measures in the table below 
the most comparable financial measures to our total cash cost is mine cost of sales calculated in accordance with us gaap 
mine cost of sales is obtained from the consolidated statements of operations 
three months ended december  twelve months ended december  in thousands  except ounces sold and total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce gold equivalent ounces sold cost of sales production costs treatment and refining charges by product credits depreciation and amortization accretion reclamation costs stock based compensation total cash costs total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold including royalties cash flow from mine site operations cash flow from mine site operations cash flow from mine site operations is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap measure 
this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 
we believe that certain investors use this measure as a basis to assess mine performance and we use it as a measure on which our planned distributions to shareholders are currently based 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from mine site operations to mine gross profit as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
three months ended december  twelve months ended december  in thousands mine gross profit stock based compensation depreciation and amortization accretion cash flow from mine site operations liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  consisting of current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
this represents a decrease of million from the working capital balance of million as of december  our working capital balance fluctuates as we use cash to fund our operations  exploration  and mine development and construction activities  and to pay income taxes and fund our dividends 
prior to achieving profitable operations in  we relied on equity financings to fund our operating activities 
since achieving profitability in  we have relied on cash flow generated from mining operations to fund our operations  income tax obligations  dividends and other activities 
our mine development  construction activities and equipment purchases at the la arista mine are  in the aggregate  expected to be higher in as compared to or if our cash flows from operations is insufficient to cover our anticipated expenses we may be required to secure debt or equity financing  reduce our planned development  construction or other expenditures at the mine  reduce our monthly dividend or implement other measures 
there is no assurance that  in the event debt or equity financing is needed  we would be able to secure this financing or that it could be secured under favorable terms 
we target calendar year cash distributions to our shareholders totaling approximately one third of cash flow from mine site operations see non gaap measures above  subject to the laws of the state of colorado that govern distributions to shareholders 
our target dividend payment of one third of cash flow from mine site operations may be increased  decreased  suspended or discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the board of directors based on company development requirements and strategies  cash balances  construction projects  spot gold and silver prices  taxation  general market conditions or any other reason 
for the year ended december   we declared dividends of million  representing of cash flow from mine site operations 
upon declaration of a dividend  each shareholder has the option to subsequently convert that cash dividend into gold and or silver bullion 
to the extent we do not hold sufficient gold and silver bullion by the distribution payment date we must purchase gold and or silver bullion in the market 
we intend to purchase gold and silver bullion in the market at various times throughout the year  and intend to hold quantities of gold and or silver bullion to enable us to meet  at a minimum  our forecasted physical delivery requirements for the current and following month 
the mineral concessions that comprise our la arista underground mine are subject to a net smelter returns royalty on sales of any gold and silver dore  and a net smelter returns royalty on sales of any concentrate 
we produce copper  lead and zinc concentrates  but no gold and silver dore  at la arista underground mine 
we only produced a gold and silver concentrate at our el aguila open pit mine 
royalties are considered mine operating costs and are funded from the sale of concentrates 
royalty expense is recorded based on provisional invoices and adjusted based on the final invoice 
an initial royalty payment of of the provisional invoice amount is made when the provisional invoice is collected 
the remaining royalties owed are paid when we receive full payment for the final invoice 
for the years ended december  and  we made royalty payments totaling and  respectively 
we estimate that approximately million of royalty payments will be made in  subject to market prices for the metals in our concentrates  mine production and timing of final invoice settlements 
for we have budgeted approximately million for drilling and other exploration related activities at our el aguila property 
in addition  we intend to spend approximately million for drilling and other exploration activities on our other exploration properties in mexico 
in turkey  we have budgeted million for exploration and property acquisitions 
our planned exploration expenditures for are discretionary and could be significantly higher or lower depending on the ongoing results from the exploration programs 
exploration activities to further delineate and define our la arista vein system are considered mine development costs and classified as development and construction expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  decreased to million from million as of december   a net decrease in cash of million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million during the million decrease in net cash provided by operation activities principally results from payment of our mexican income tax liability in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures and increase in proceeds from conversion of gold and silver bullion related to our physical gold and silver dividend program 
although most of our exploration stage expenditures are recorded as an expense rather than an investment  we capitalize the acquisition cost of land and mineral rights and certain equipment that has alternative future uses or significant salvage value  including rolling stock  furniture  and electronics 
the cost of acquiring these assets is reflected in our investing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to  consisting of dividends declared and treasury stock purchases 
the million increase in net cash used in financing activities principally results from an increase in dividends paid in in august  we instituted a regular monthly dividend consisting of per share  which was increased to per share in april  until such time as the board of directors determines otherwise 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations our known obligations at fiscal year end december   are set forth in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands purchase obligations operating leases non cancellable purchase obligations employee salary compensation total represents amounts due to our executive officers pursuant to their respective employment agreements with our company

accounting developments for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities and contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
as a result  management is required to routinely make judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions 
the following discussion pertains to accounting estimates management believes are most critical to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
proven or probable reserves despite the fact that we commenced production in  as of december   none of the mineralized material at the company s el aguila project or any of its other properties met the sec s definition of proven or probable reserves under the criteria set forth in sec industry guide as a result  and in accordance with principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap for exploration stage companies  we do not capitalize exploration  evaluation  mine development and construction costs associated with our properties and  instead  expense these costs as they are incurred 
revenue we recognize revenue when an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  the title and risk of loss have transferred to the buyer generally at the time shipment is delivered at buyer s port and collection is reasonably assured 
we enter into provisionally priced concentrate sales contracts  whereby the contracts settle at prices to be determined in the future based on quoted prices 
accordingly  due to the time elapsed between shipment and the final settlement with the buyer  the company must estimate revenue based on assay measurements taken at the time of shipment using quoted metal prices at that time 
changes in the price of the metals concentrates we sell  and differences in assay measurements taken at our facilities at the time of shipment and those taken at the buyer s port  can have a significant effect on our revenues 
concentrate sales are initially recorded using quoted metal prices at the time of shipment  and contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes 
the host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the quoted metal prices at the time of shipment 
the embedded derivative  which does not qualify for hedge accounting  is adjusted to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement 
changes in the prices of metals we sell  as quoted on the london bullion market  between the shipment and final settlement dates will result in adjustments to revenues related to sales of concentrate previously recorded upon shipment 
sales are recorded net of charges for treatment  refining  smelting losses and other charges negotiated by the company with the buyer 
these charges are estimated upon shipment of concentrates based on contractual terms and adjusted to reflect actual charges at final settlement 
historically  actual charges have not varied materially from our initial estimates 
changes in the market price of metals significantly affect the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flow 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the company s control  such as political and economic conditions  demand  forward selling by producers  expectations for inflation  custom smelter activities  the relative exchange rate of the us dollar  investor sentiment  and global mine production levels 
the aggregate effect of these factors is impossible to predict 
because the company s revenue is derived from the sale of gold  silver  copper  lead and zinc metals concentrate  its results of operations are directly related to the prices of these metals 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization on our property and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of the estimated life of the assets 
impairment of assets since none of our properties contain proven or probable reserves as defined by the sec  we do not capitalize exploration  evaluation  mine development or construction costs for any of our projects 
our long lived assets are principally property and equipment  and are evaluated at least annually for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when an indication of impairment exists  an estimate of fair value is made for the long lived asset 
assessing the fair value of our long lived assets requires us to make several estimates and assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainty  changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of our long lived asset carrying values 
events that could result in impairment of our long lived assets include  but are not limited to  obsolescence  damage  underperformance and assets held for disposal 
during the years ended december   and  no asset impairments were recognized 
stockpile and concentrate inventories stockpile and concentrate ending inventory tonnages are measured by estimating the number of tonnes added to and removed from beginning inventory 
we periodically survey our stockpile and concentrate ending inventory to verify tonnage estimates 
there are inherent limitations in the survey estimation process  along with process of estimating the number of tonnes added to and removed from stockpile and concentrate inventory  which includes but is not limited to moisture content  density  scale calibration and physical measurements 
due to these estimates  amounts reported could differ significantly from actual results 
our stockpile and concentrate inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value nrv  with carrying values evaluated at least quarterly 
nrv represents the estimated future sales price based on short term and long term metals prices  less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale 
the primary factors that influence the need to record write downs of stockpile and concentrate inventory include short term and long term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor  fuel and energy  materials and supplies  as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates 
if short term and long term metals prices decrease  the value of stockpile and concentrate inventory also decreases  and it may be necessary to record a write down of stockpile and concentrate inventory to nrv 
we did not incur any lower of cost or market write downs during the years ended december   or the allocation of costs to stockpile and concentrate inventory  and the determination of nrv involve the use of estimates 
there is a high degree of judgment in estimating current and future operating and capital costs  metal recoveries  ore grades  production levels  commodity prices  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions 
asset retirement obligation our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations  including legal and contractual obligations to reclaim  remediate  or otherwise restore properties at the time the property is removed from service 
a liability is initially recorded at the estimated present value for an obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
since none of our properties contain proven or probable reserves as defined by the sec  the costs associated with the obligation are charged to operations 
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates of the future costs we will incur to complete the work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs may differ from the amounts estimated 
also  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using a black scholes model  the inputs of which require various assumptions including the expected rate of future dividends  discount rate  the expected life of the option and the expected volatility of our stock price 
the expected rate of future dividends is derived based on the dividends paid during the months immediately preceding the date of grant extrapolated over four quarters one year  however  the rate at which dividends are paid may change due to various factors  including  but not limited to changes in our operational and strategic cash needs and at the discretion of our board of directors 
expected forfeiture rates and expected option life are derived based on historical experience and management s judgment regarding future expectations 
however  such historical experience is limited due to a relatively small number of grants and  therefore  may not be indicative of future experience 
the expected volatility assumptions are derived using our historical stock price volatility 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  however  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
if factors change and we use a different methodology for deriving the black scholes assumptions or if our assumptions and judgments regarding future experience prove to be materially different than actual experience resulting in a change to future assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
deferred income taxes and valuation allowances in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities generally have a direct impact on earnings in the period of the changes 
where applicable tax laws and regulations are either unclear or subject to varying interpretations  it is possible that changes in these estimates could occur that materially affect the amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements 
each period  we evaluate the likelihood of whether or not some portion or all of each deferred tax asset will be realized and provide a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
when evaluating our valuation allowance  we consider historic and future expected levels of taxable income  the pattern and timing of reversals of taxable temporary timing differences that give rise to deferred tax liabilities  and tax planning initiatives 
levels of future taxable income are affected by  among other things  market gold prices  production costs  quantities of proven or probable gold reserves  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
if we determine that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance with be increased with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense 
in addition  the calculation of income tax expense involves significant management estimation and judgment involving a number of assumptions 
in determining these amounts  management interprets tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and makes estimates of the expected timing of the reversal of future tax assets and liabilities 
we also make assumptions about future earnings  tax planning strategies and the extent to which potential future tax benefits will be used 
we are also subject to assessments by various taxation authorities which may interpret tax legislation differently  which could affect the final amount or the timing of tax payments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in interest rates  equity price risks  commodity price fluctuations  and country risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk  however  we may consider such arrangements in the future as we evaluate our business and financial strategy 
commodity price risk the results of our operations will depend in large part upon the market prices of gold and silver 
gold and silver prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
the level of interest rates  the rate of inflation  the world supply of gold and silver and the stability of exchange rates  among other factors  can all cause significant fluctuations in commodity prices 
such external economic factors are in turn influenced by changes in international investment patterns  monetary systems and political developments 
the price of gold and silver has fluctuated widely in recent years  and future price declines could cause a mineral project to become uneconomic  thereby having a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we have not entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for gold or silver 
we may in the future more actively manage our exposure through derivative contracts or other commodity price risk management programs  although we have no intention of doing so in the near term 
in addition to adversely affecting our mineralized material estimates and our financial condition  declining gold and silver prices could require a reassessment of the feasibility of a particular project 
even if a project is ultimately determined to be economically viable  the need to conduct such a reassessment may cause delays in the implementation of a project 
foreign currency risk we transact a significant amount of our business in mexican pesos 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies such as the peso against the us dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in us dollar terms in mexico  which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in us dollar terms 
the value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
we have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we also hold portions of our cash reserves in non us dollar currencies 
provisional sales contract risk we enter into concentrate sales contracts with third party smelters 
the contracts  in general  provide for a provisional payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices 
the provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes 
the host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale 
the embedded derivative  which is the final settlement based on a future price  does not qualify for hedge accounting and is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement 
at december   we had outstanding provisionally priced sales of million consisting of  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver  tons of copper   tons of lead and  tons of zinc which had a fair value of approximately million including the embedded derivative 
if the price for each metal were to change by one percent  the change plus or minus in the total fair value of the concentrates sold would be approximately  interest rate risk we have no debt outstanding nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time 
equity price risk we have in the past sought and may in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common stock and other equity 
movements in the price of our common stock have been volatile in the past and may also be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell our common stock at an acceptable price should the need for new equity funding arise 
country risk all of our mineral properties are located in mexico 
in the past  that country has been subject to political instability  increasing crime  changes and uncertainties which may cause changes to existing government regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities 
civil or political unrest could disrupt our operations at any time 
our exploration and mining activities may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that could increase the costs related to our activities or maintaining our properties 
finally  mexico s status as a developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain required financing for our properties
