we offer seven free services and ten premium services 
sales of our premium services are generated through word of mouth referrals  web based advertising  expiring free trials that we convert to paid subscriptions and direct marketing to new and existing customers 
we derive our revenue principally from subscription fees from smbs  it service providers  mobile carriers  customer service centers  oems  and consumers 
the majority of our customers subscribe to our services on an annual basis 
our revenue is driven primarily by the number and type of our premium services for which our paying customers subscribe 
for the year ended december   we generated revenues of million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately 
in addition to selling our services to end users  we entered into a service and marketing agreement with intel corporation in december pursuant to which we adapted our service delivery platform  gravity  to work with specific technology delivered with intel hardware and software products 
the agreement provided that intel market and sell the services to its customers 
intel paid us a minimum license and service fee on a quarterly basis during the term of the agreement  and we shared with intel revenue generated by the use of the services by third parties to the extent it exceeded certain minimum payments 
we began recognizing revenue associated with the intel service and marketing agreement in the quarter ended september  upon receipt of customer acceptance 
in september  intel notified us that it intended to terminate the connectivity service and marketing agreement effective on december  in accordance with the termination provisions of the agreement  intel paid us a one time termination fee of million and did not owe us any of the million in fees associated with  the final year of the agreement 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue from this agreement  which includes the million termination fee which was paid in december through december   we have primarily funded our operations through the sale of common stock in connection with our initial and secondary offerings which resulted in proceeds of million  the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock which resulted in proceeds of approximately million and cash flows from operations 
we earned net income of million for  million for  and million for we expect to continue making significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business 

table of contents certain trends and uncertainties the following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties  which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
this summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties that could impact our business in the long or short term 
the summary  however  should be considered along with the factors identified in the section titled risk factors of this annual report on form k 
we continue to closely monitor current adverse economic conditions  particularly as they impact smbs  it service providers and consumers 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries  but the longer the duration the greater risks we face in operating our business 
we believe that competition will continue to increase 
increased competition could result from existing competitors or new competitors that enter the market because of the potential opportunity 
we will continue to closely monitor competitive activity and respond accordingly 
increased competition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that as we continue to grow revenue at expected rates  our cost of revenue and operating expenses  including sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
for a description of the general trends we anticipate in various expense categories  see cost of revenue and operating expenses below 
there is frequent litigation in the software and technology industries based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
we have been  and may in the future be  subject to third party patent infringement or other intellectual property related lawsuits as we face increasing competition and become increasingly visible 
any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue principally from subscription fees from smbs  it service providers  mobile carriers  customer service centers  oems and consumers 
our revenue is driven primarily by the number and type of our premium services for which our paying customers subscribe and is not concentrated within one customer or group of customers 
the majority of our customers subscribe to our services on an annual basis and pay in advance  typically with a credit card  for their subscription 
a smaller percentage of our customers subscribe to our services on a monthly basis through either month to month commitments or annual commitments that are then paid monthly with a credit card 
we initially record a subscription fee as deferred revenue and then recognize it ratably  on a daily basis  over the life of the subscription period 
typically  a subscription automatically renews at the end of a subscription period unless the customer specifically terminates it prior to the end of the period 
in addition to our subscription fees  to a lesser extent  we generate revenue from license and annual maintenance fees from the licensing of our remotelyanywhere product 
we license remotelyanywhere to our customers on a perpetual basis 
because we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for our maintenance arrangements  we record the initial license and maintenance fee as deferred revenue and recognize the fees as revenue ratably  on a daily basis  over the initial maintenance period 
we also initially record maintenance fees for subsequent maintenance periods as deferred revenue and recognize revenue ratably  on a daily basis  over the maintenance period 
we also generate revenue from the license of our ignition for iphone  ipad and android product  which is sold as a perpetual license and is recognized as delivered 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced logmein for ios  a free app for iphones and ipads  to the apple app store and changed our ignition for iphone and ipad business model from a perpetually based licensing model to a subscription based business model 
we believe this change will have a positive impact on our business  but short term the business model change has impacted the revenue recognized from our ignition product 

table of contents employees we have increased our number of full time employees to at december  as compared to at december  cost of revenue and operating expenses we allocate certain overhead expenses  such as rent and utilities  to expense categories based on the headcount in or office space occupied by personnel in that expense category as a percentage of our total headcount or office space 
as a result  an overhead allocation associated with these costs is reflected in the cost of revenue and each operating expense category 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with our data center operations and customer support centers  including wages and benefits for personnel  telecommunication and hosting fees for our services  equipment maintenance  software license and maintenance fees and depreciation 
additionally  amortization expense associated with the acquired software and technology as well as internally developed software is included in cost of revenue 
the expenses related to hosting our services and supporting our free and premium customers is related to the number of customers who subscribe to our services and the complexity and redundancy of our services and hosting infrastructure 
we expect cost of revenue expenses to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue as we continue to increase our number of customers over time 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for development personnel  professional fees associated with outsourced development projects  facilities rent and depreciation associated with assets used in development 
we have focused our research and development efforts on both improving ease of use and functionality of our existing services  as well as developing new offerings 
the majority of our research and development employees are located in our development centers in europe 
therefore  a majority of research and development expense is subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the majority of research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
however  we capitalized approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  of costs related to internally developed computer software to be sold as a service  which was incurred during the application development stage 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of an increase in stock based compensation offset by lower contingent payment costs associated with acquisitions and as we continue to enhance and expand our services and invest in research and development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online search and advertising costs  wages  commissions and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  offline marketing costs such as media advertising and trade shows  professional fees and credit card processing fees 
online search and advertising costs consist primarily of pay per click payments to search engines and other online advertising media such as banner ads 
offline marketing costs include radio and print advertisements as well as the costs to create and produce these advertisements  and tradeshows  including the costs of space at tradeshows and costs to design and construct tradeshow booths 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
in order to continue to grow our business and awareness of our services  we expect that we will continue to commit resources to our sales and marketing efforts 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management  human resources  internal it support  finance and accounting personnel  professional fees  insurance and other corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase primarily due to the significant legal costs associated with our continued defense against the patent infringement claims made by communique and the declaratory judgment action we filed against pragmatus 
additionally  general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel  enhance our internal information systems  incur additional expenses related to audit  accounting and insurance costs 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will significantly increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily related to defending the patent infringement claims made by 
table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are summarized below 
see note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from subscription fees related to our premium services  the licensing of our ignition for iphone  ipad and android software products  and the licensing of our remotelyanywhere software and its related maintenance 
revenue from our premium subscription services is recognized on a daily basis over the subscription term as the services are delivered  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is deemed reasonably assured 
subscription periods range from monthly to five years  but are generally one year in duration 
our software cannot be run on another entity s hardware nor do customers have the right to take possession of the software and use it on their own or another entity s hardware 
revenue from the sales of our ignition for iphone  ipad and android software product  which is sold as a perpetual license  is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fee is probable  and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable 
our multi element arrangements typically include subscription and professional services  which may include development services 
we evaluate each element within the arrangement to determine if they can be accounted for as separate units of accounting 
if the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis  either because they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered item or items on a standalone basis  we have determined that the deliverables within these arrangements qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we recognize revenue for each delivered item or items as a separate earnings process commencing when all of the significant performance obligations have been performed and when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in cases where we have determined that the delivered items within our multi element arrangements do not have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the total consideration is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement  or the estimated customer life  commencing when all of the significant performance obligations have been delivered and when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
income taxes 
we are subject to federal  state  and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate  and we use estimates in determining our provision for these income taxes and deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities are determined separately by tax jurisdiction 
in making these determinations  we estimate deferred tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities  and we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
at december  and  our deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating losses  research and development credit carryforwards  and stock option compensation expense 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized  and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
during  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize certain of our deferred tax assets primarily as a result of continued profitability  achieving three years of cumulative profitability and forecasted future earnings 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance related to our us and certain foreign deferred tax assets of million during the year ended december  as of december  and  we maintained a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our hungarian subsidiary 
this entity has historical losses and we concluded it was not more likely than not that these deferred tax assets are realizable 

table of contents during  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to our cosm subsidiary and concluded that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets as a result of projected future profitability 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance related to our cosm subsidiary of approximately  during the year ended december  we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit we have taken in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized 
potential interest and penalties associated with any uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we provided a liability of approximately  for uncertain tax positions 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment that is subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
on january   president barack obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of this law extended the federal research and development tax credit for the year ended december  since the law was signed after december   we will record a federal income tax benefit of approximately  related to the r d tax credit in the financial statements 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we record goodwill as the excess of the acquisition price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill  but perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on the last day of our fiscal year and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its fair value 
we operate as a single operating segment with one reporting unit and consequently evaluate goodwill for impairment based on an evaluation of the fair value of the company as a whole 
as of december   our fair value as a whole significantly exceeds our carrying value 
no impairments have been recorded through december  we record intangible assets at their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized based upon the pattern in which their economic benefit will be realized  or if this pattern cannot be reliably determined  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to seven years 
stock based compensation 
share based awards are accounted for at fair value  which requires us to recognize compensation expense for all share based awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after january  these costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for all time based vested awards 
the assumptions used in determining the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change  and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation could be materially different in the future 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on a us treasury instrument with a term similar to the expected term of the share based award 
the expected term of options has been estimated utilizing the vesting period of the option  the contractual life of the option and our option exercise history 
we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of comparable public companies over the option s expected term as well as our own stock price volatility since our ipo 
we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
accordingly  we have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options based on our historical forfeiture rate and we use these rates to develop future forfeiture rates 
if our actual forfeiture rate varies from our historical rates and estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
past fair value of option grants may not be a reliable indicator of future fair values as assumptions such as volatility may change over time 
loss contingencies 
we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings and may be subject to additional legal claims and proceedings in the future that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of a loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount 
we regularly evaluate current information available and reflect the impact of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and updated information to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required and update our disclosures accordingly 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to sig 
table of contents nificant uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the majority of our research and development expenditures being made from our hungarian research and development facilities  and in our international sales and marketing offices in the netherlands  the united kingdom  australia  japan  brazil and india 
in the year ended december   approximately     and of our operating expenses occurred in our operations in hungary  the netherlands  the united kingdom  australia  japan and ireland  respectively  and less than each in brazil and india 
in the year ended december   approximately   and of our operating expenses occurred in our operations in hungary  the netherlands  the united kingdom and australia  respectively  and less than each in japan  brazil and india 
additionally  an increasing percentage of our sales outside the united states are denominated in local currencies and  thus  also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our operations  and a future change of or less in foreign currency exchange rates would not materially affect our operations 
at this time we do not  but may in the future  enter into any foreign currency hedging programs or instruments that would hedge or help offset such foreign currency exchange rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
however  based on the nature and current level of our cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which are primarily consisted of cash  money market instruments  government securities and agency bonds  we believe there is no material risk of exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as a result of changes in interest rates
