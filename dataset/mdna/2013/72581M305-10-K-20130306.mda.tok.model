we continually seek to expand our technology portfolio through internal development  co development with business partners and evaluation of acquisition opportunities 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of end customers and distributors 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force  distributors and manufacturers representatives 
we sell to distributors in japan  taiwan  china  korea  europe  southeast asia and the u 
s  and our manufacturers representatives support some of our korean and european sales 
our distributors typically provide engineering support to our end customers and often have valuable and established relationships with our end customers 
in certain countries in which we operate  it is customary to sell to distributors 
while distributor payment to us is not dependent upon the distributor s ability to resell the product or to collect from the end customer  the distributors may provide longer payment terms to end customers than those we would offer 
significant portions of our products are sold overseas 
sales outside the us accounted for approximately of revenue in and of revenue in and our integrators  branded manufacturers and branded suppliers incorporate our products into systems that are sold worldwide 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december   and year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue  net net revenue was as follows in thousands year ended december  v 
v 
change change change change revenue  net v 
net revenue decreased million  or  from to revenue related to ic product sales was million and million for and  respectively 
revenue related to the license of intellectual property ip was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue related to ic product sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling price asp and a decrease in units sold 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to a greater proportion of unit sales of our latest generation motionengine co processor ics  which have lower price points than our other product lines 
the decrease in asp was also attributable to reduced pricing on our earlier generation digital projector products 
the decrease in units sold was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our earlier generation digital projector products due to competitive factors affecting customer transition to next generation digital projector solutions 
we anticipate that an industry wide inventory correction and seasonality will contribute to reduced revenue for the first quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of we have historically experienced higher revenue from the digital projector market during the third quarter of the year and lower revenue during the first quarter of the year  as our japanese customers reduce inventories in anticipation of their march fiscal year end 
v 
net revenue decreased million  or  from to revenue related to ic product sales was million and million for and  respectively 
revenue related to the license of ip was million there was no revenue related to the license of ip in the decrease in revenue related to ic product sales was attributable to a decrease in asp  partially offset by a increase in units sold 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to a greater proportion of unit sales of our motionengine co processor ics  which have a lower price point than our other product lines 
the decrease was also attributable to reduced pricing on our earlier generation digital projector products and changes in the mix of digital projector product sales 
the increase in units sold was primarily attributable to increased sales into the advanced television market of our motionengine co processor ics as sales associated with recent design wins ramped in volume at top tier advanced television market customers 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in digital projector unit sales which was primarily due to an inventory correction during the first half of cost of revenue and gross profit cost of revenue and gross profit were as follows in thousands year ended december  of revenue of revenue of revenue direct product costs and related overhead licensing costs inventory charges amortization of acquired developed technology other cost of revenue total cost of revenue gross profit includes purchased materials  assembly  test  labor  employee benefits  warranty expense and royalties 
includes direct labor costs and allocated overhead associated with license revenue arrangements 
includes charges to reduce inventory to lower of cost or market 
includes stock based compensation and additional amortization of a non cancelable prepaid royalty 
v 
cost of revenue decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in the recognition of higher margin licensing revenue during compared to the decrease was also due to a decrease in direct product costs as a percentage of revenue due to reduced material costs  partially offset by non recurring charges related to a discontinued product 
pixelworks gross margin is subject to variability based on changes in revenue levels  recognition of license revenue  product mix  asps  startup costs  and the timing and execution of manufacturing ramps as well as other factors 
v 
total cost of revenue decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in the decrease resulted primarily from reduced inventory charges as we transitioned our customers to our next generation of motionengine co processor ic products in as well as the elimination of amortization expense for acquired developed technology assets that were fully amortized as of the second quarter of the increase in direct product costs as a percentage of revenue from to was primarily due to customer transition to our new digital projector products and motionengine co processor ic products  which have higher material costs than earlier generation products  this increase was partially offset by million of ip license revenue recorded in for which there were no associated period costs 
research and development research and development expense includes compensation and related costs for personnel  development related expenses including non recurring engineering and fees for outside services  depreciation and amortization  expensed equipment  facilities and information technology expense allocations and travel and related expenses 
co development agreement during the second quarter of  we entered into a best efforts co development agreement the co development agreement with a customer to defray a portion of the research and development expenses we expect to incur in connection with our development of an ic product to be sold exclusively to the customer 
we expect our development costs to exceed the amounts received from the customer under the co development agreement  and although we expect to sell units of the product to the customer  there is no commitment or agreement from the customer for such sales at this time 
additionally  we retain ownership of any modifications or improvements to our pre existing intellectual property and may use such improvements in products sold to other customers 
the initial million due under the co development agreement was received within sixty days of contract signing and two additional payments of million are each payable upon completion of certain development milestones 
as amounts become due and payable without recourse  they are offset against research and development expense up to the amount of related costs incurred 
we recognized an offset to research and development expense of million related to the co development agreement during during  we expect to complete all of the milestones related to the co development agreement and realize the remaining million of reimbursement 
research and development expense was as follows in thousands year ended december  v 
v 
change change change change research and development v 
research and development expense decreased million  or from to the decrease was primarily attributable to a benefit of million recognized in partially offset by an increase in non recurring engineering expense of million 
the benefit recognized and the increase in non recurring engineering expense are both related to the co development agreement 
the decrease was also attributable to a decrease of million in outside services expense due to the timing of development activities and a decrease of million from a reduction in direct labor costs and allocated overhead associated with the utilization of research and development engineers on license revenue agreements  these costs were recorded in cost of revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation expense due to annual merit salary increases and variable compensation expense 
v 
research and development expense increased million from to the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation expense due primarily to annual merit salary increases 
the increase is also due to a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to intellectual property and engineering software tool additions 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in non recurring engineering and outside services expense due to the timing of development activities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense includes compensation and related costs for personnel  sales commissions  allocations for facilities and information technology expenses  travel  outside services and other general expenses incurred in our sales  marketing  customer support  management  legal and other professional and administrative support functions 
selling  general and administrative expense was as follows in thousands year ended december  v 
v 
change change change change selling  general and administrative v 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  from to the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is attributable primarily to a decrease in several expense categories as the company focused on cost management 
the decrease is also attributable in part to decreases in compensation expense achieved by reduced headcount and a decrease in vacation expense 
however  these reductions in compensation expense were partially offset by annual merit salary increases and increased variable compensation expense 
v 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  from to the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation expense due to annual merit salary increases and a million increase in stock compensation expense 
these increases were offset by a general decrease in most other expense categories as the company focused on cost management 
other income expense  net net other income expense consisted of the following in thousands year ended december  change v 
v 
interest expense and other  net gain on sale of patents gain on sale of marketable securities total other income expense  net interest expense and other  net consists of interest expense  interest income and amortization of debt issuance costs 
the decrease from compared to and from compared to is primarily due to a decrease in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs attributable to the repayment of our convertible subordinated debentures in the second quarter of in the first quarter of  we sold certain patents and related rights and materials for proceeds and a net gain of million 
all of the patents were originally obtained by us during our june acquisition of equator technologies  inc  and the underlying technologies pertain to markets that we no longer pursue 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes was as follows in thousands year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes the income tax benefit recorded for the year ended december  is comprised of a benefit of million for the reversal of previously recorded tax contingencies due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations  partially offset by million in current and deferred tax expense for our profitable cost plus foreign entities and accruals for tax contingencies in foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax expense recorded for the year ended december  is comprised of million in current and deferred tax expense for our profitable cost plus foreign entities and accruals for tax contingencies in foreign jurisdictions  partially offset by a benefit of million for the reversal of previously recorded tax contingencies due to the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation 
the income tax benefit recorded for the year ended december  of million was primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded tax contingencies due to the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation  partially offset by current and deferred tax expense in profitable cost plus foreign jurisdictions 
we continue to record a full valuation allowance against our us and canadian net deferred tax assets at december  and as it is not more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period 
we have not provided a valuation allowance against any of our other foreign net deferred tax assets as we have concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period because our subsidiaries in these jurisdictions are cost plus taxpayers 
as of december   we have federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively  which will expire between and as of december   we have available federal  state and foreign research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively  which begin expiring in we have a general foreign tax credit of million which will begin expiring in our ability to utilize our federal net operating losses may be limited by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  which imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its tax liability 
an ownership change is generally defined as a greater than point increase in equity ownership by shareholders in any three year period 
liquidity and capital resources cash and short and long term marketable securities our cash and cash equivalent and short and long term marketable securities were as follows in thousands december  change v 
v 
cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities total cash and marketable securities total cash and marketable securities decreased million from to the decrease resulted primarily from million used for payments on property and equipment and million in payments on other asset financing  partially offset by million provided by operating activities due primarily to changes in working capital 
total cash and marketable securities decreased million from to the decrease resulted primarily from million used to repurchase our outstanding debentures  million used to repay the outstanding balance on our line of credit  million in payments on other asset financing  million for purchases of property and equipment and other assets and million used in operations 
these decreases were partially offset by million in net proceeds from our equity offering and million in proceeds from the sale of patents 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balance of million consisted of million in cash and million in us denominated money market funds 
although we did not hold short or long term investments as of december   our investment policy requires that our portfolio maintains a weighted average maturity of less than months 
additionally  no maturities can extend beyond months and concentrations with individual securities are limited 
investments must be rated at least a p f by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and our investment policy is reviewed at least annually by our audit committee 
although cash balances held at our foreign subsidiaries would be subject to us taxes if repatriated  we have sufficient us net operating losses to eliminate the liability associated with any such repatriation and foreign taxes due upon repatriation would not be significant 
accounts receivable  net accounts receivable  net decreased to million at december  from million at december  average number of days sales outstanding increased to days at december  from days at december  inventories inventories decreased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turnover decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to decreased cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of inventory turnover is calculated based on annualized quarterly operating results and average inventory balances during the quarter 
capital resources short term line of credit on december   we entered into a loan and security agreement the revolving loan agreement with silicon valley bank the bank 
on december   we and the bank entered into amendment no 
to the revolving loan agreement 
the revolving loan agreement  as amended  provides a secured working capital based revolving line of credit the revolving line in an aggregate amount of up to the lesser of i million  or ii million plus of eligible domestic accounts receivable and certain foreign accounts receivable 
in addition  the revolving loan agreement  as amended  provides for non formula advances of up to million which may be made solely during the last five business days of any fiscal month or quarter and which must be repaid by the company on or before the fifth business day after the applicable fiscal month or quarter end 
due to their repayment terms  non formula advances do not provide the company with usable liquidity 
the revolving loan agreement  as amended  contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as customary events of default 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the company obligations under the revolving loan agreement  as amended  and an increase to the applicable interest rate  and would permit the bank to exercise remedies with respect to its security interest 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the terms of the revolving loan agreement  as amended 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line as of december  and equity offering in may  we sold  shares of common stock in an underwritten registered offering at a price to the public of per share 
net proceeds to the company  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions  and other expenses  were approximately million 
liquidity as of december   we have no short or long term debt and our cash and cash equivalents balance of million is highly liquid 
we anticipate that our existing working capital will be adequate to fund our operating  investing and financing needs for the next twelve months 
if necessary  management will pursue financing arrangements including the issuance of debt or equity securities or will reduce expenditures  in order to meet the company s cash requirements 
there is no assurance that  if required  we will be able to raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide the required liquidity which  in turn  may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
from time to time  we may evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement our business 
any further transactions  if consummated  may consume a material portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in dilution to existing shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  amortization of prepaid royalties  valuation of share based payments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for product sales  we require customers to provide purchase orders prior to shipment and we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms 
these conditions are generally satisfied upon shipment of the underlying product 
on occasion  we derive revenue from the license of our internally developed ip 
ip licensing agreements that we enter into generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our ip components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee 
our license fee arrangements generally include multiple deliverables and we are required to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using management s best estimate of selling price esp  if third party evidence tpe or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe does not exist 
we defer revenue recognition for consideration that is contingent upon future performance or other contractual terms 
the company s process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
the key factors considered by the company in developing the esps include the nature and complexity of different technologies being licensed  our cost to provide the deliverables  the availability of substitute technologies in the marketplace and the company s historical pricing practices 
we then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria mentioned above 
sales returns and allowances 
our customers do not have a stated right to return product except for replacement of defective products under our warranty program discussed below 
however  we have accepted customer returns on a case by case basis as customer accommodations in the past 
as a result  we provide for these returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the reserve for returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
certain of our distributors have stock rotation provisions in their distributor agreements  which allow them to return of the products purchased in the prior six months in exchange for products of equal value 
we analyze historical stock rotations at the end of each reporting period 
to date  returns under the stock rotation provisions have been nominal 
certain distributors also have price protection provisions in their distributor agreements with us 
under the price protection provisions  we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a specific end customer and we subsequently lower the price to the end customer such that the distributor can no longer earn its negotiated margin on in stock inventory 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
product warranties 
we warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of twelve months from delivery 
warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original warranty period 
our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing products  or refunding the purchase price 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for warranty returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  which include actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  should actual product failure rates or product replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit to customers after careful examination of their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our account by account risk analysis of outstanding receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in addition  we write down any obsolete  unmarketable or otherwise impaired inventory to net realizable value 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
the estimate of future demand is compared to inventory levels to determine the amount  if any  of obsolete or excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected at the time the inventory was written down  additional inventory write downs may be required 
inventory valuation is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
amortization of non cancelable prepaid royalty 
as of december   we had a prepaid non cancelable royalty of million for the license of ip from a third party 
we amortize the prepaid based on our estimated average unit cost  which is dependent upon forecasted shipments of our products that contain the licensed ip 
if our actual shipments are less than forecasted  the estimated amortization rate will increase in the future 
useful lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets 
we evaluate the remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if there is an indicator of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of each asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
while we have concluded that the carrying value of our long lived assets is recoverable as of december   our analysis is dependent upon our estimates of future cash flows and our actual results may vary 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain estimates  including an expected forfeiture rate and expected term of options granted 
we also make decisions regarding the method of calculating expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the option pricing model 
the resulting calculated fair value of stock options is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
when there are changes to the assumptions used in the option pricing model  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  there will be variations in the calculated fair value of our future stock option awards  which results in variation in the compensation cost recognized 
additionally  any modification of an award that increases its fair value will require us to recognize additional expense 
income taxes 
we record deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we also regularly conduct a comprehensive review of our uncertain tax positions 
in this regard  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities  we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheet 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years operating leases payments on accrued balances related to asset purchases estimated purchase commitments to contract manufacturers total the operating lease payments above are net of sublease rental income of million for the year ending december  we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and repatriation of foreign earnings  therefore  million of income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies in part ii  item of this form k for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   all of our cash equivalents were held in highly liquid money market accounts  accordingly  we do not have significant exposure to changes in interest rates 
exchange rate risk we are exposed to risks resulting from the fluctuations of foreign currencies  primarily those of japan  taiwan  korea and the people republic of china 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems that incorporate our products into other products that they sell outside of the us while sales of our products to oems are denominated in us dollars  the products sold by oems are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  any strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies will increase the foreign currency price equivalent of our products  which could lead to a change in the competitive nature of these products in the marketplace 
in addition  a portion of our operating expenses  such as employee salaries and foreign income taxes  are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar will negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we analyze our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations  however  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future
