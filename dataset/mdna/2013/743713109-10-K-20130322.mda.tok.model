item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and note segment and geographic information in our consolidated financial statements 
capitalize on increasing customer expectations for access to comprehensive  user friendly e commerce capabilities we plan to further enhance the functionality and ease of use of our platform and expand the capabilities of our technology in order to further increase automation and meet the evolving needs of product developers worldwide 
we believe product developers have come to expect advanced web based tools and a fully integrated internet platform from their vendors 
we will continue to use the internet to provide product developers with a standardized interface through which they can upload their d cad models and obtain firm  interactive quotations quickly and efficiently 
our services our firstcut and protomold services offer many product developers the ability to quickly and efficiently outsource their low volume  quick turn custom parts manufacturing 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the historical revenue generated by each of firstcut and protomold 
firstcut our firstcut service uses commercially available cnc machines to cut plastic or metal blocks into one or more custom parts based on the d cad model uploaded by the product developer 
our efficiencies derive from the automation of the programming of these machines and a proprietary fixturing process 
the firstcut service is well suited to produce small quantities  typically in the range of one to ten parts 
protomold our protomold service uses our d cad to cnc machining technology for the automated design and manufacture of aluminum injection molds  which are then used to produce custom injection molded plastic parts on commercially available equipment 
our protomold service is used for both prototype and short run production 
prototype quantities typically range from to parts 
because we retain possession of the molds  customers who need short run production often come back to protomold for additional quantities typically ranging up to  parts 
they do so either to support pilot production while their tooling for high volume production is being prepared or because their product will only be released in a limited quantity 
these additional part orders typically occur on approximately of the molds that we make  typically accounting for approximately half of our total protomold revenue 
the process for both firstcut and protomold begins when the product developer uploads one or more d cad models representing the desired part geometry 
our proprietary software uses complex algorithms to analyze the d cad geometry  analyze its manufacturability and support the creation of an interactive  web based quotation containing pricing and manufacturability information 
a link to the quotation is then e mailed to the product developer  who can access the quotation  change a variety of order parameters and instantly see the effect on price before finalizing the order 
for firstcut  the tool paths are then reviewed and routed to our high speed cnc machining centers for execution 
in the case of protomold  our proprietary software supports the creation of the mold design and the tool paths required to manufacture the mold components  which are then routed to our cnc machining centers for execution 
once the mold is assembled  it is placed in one of our injection molding presses to create the required parts 
for both our firstcut and protomold services  we ship parts in as little as one business day from design submission 
we ship our parts via small parcel common carriers on standard terms and conditions 

table of contents the following diagram summarizes the technology enabled processes described above logo our technology our technology eliminates much of the skilled labor conventionally associated with quoting and preparing a new part design for manufacture 
our proprietary software largely automates the areas of manufacturability analysis and feedback  price quotation  order submission  mold design  tool path generation  mold or part manufacture and production management 
the more computationally intensive aspects of this software utilize a proprietary parallel processing software environment running on our in house compute cluster servers 
manufacturability analysis our proprietary software analyzes the d cad models submitted by our customers to determine the extent to which they are suitable for our standardized manufacturing processes 
in the case of cnc machining  this manufacturability analysis identifies features that may be too fragile to be machined and areas that cannot be machined at all 
for injection molding  problematic features such as undercuts  thin areas  thick areas and areas requiring geometry adjustments to allow the part to be ejected from the mold are identified 
many of our customers find this analysis particularly helpful  as it diagnoses and prevents potential problems prior to manufacturing 
we can also provide a flow analysis to identify parts that may be so thin and large that plastic will solidify before the mold can be completely filled 
our manufacturability analysis plays a major role in our automated pricing algorithms 
web based quotation we have branded our firstcut and protomold automated quotation systems as firstquote and protoquote 
both deliver an interactive graphical quotation to the customer in the form of a web page that includes a color coded d representation of the part highlighting features relevant to manufacturability 
in some cases  features are indicated that must be changed to be compatible with our process 
we also highlight and recommend design improvements that might be made to improve the manufacturability of the part  or to indicate any possible deviations between the part as it was designed and how it will be manufactured 
the web based quotation allows the customer to change material  finish  quantity or shipping schedule of orders 
pricing indicated on the web based quote instantly updates after each of these changes 
mold design our software technology and mold manufacturing system have co evolved over more than years of development  resulting in a standardized and efficient process for taking a customer s d cad model and creating the physical mold needed to make plastic parts 
our software enables our mold designers to quickly create the mold geometry specific to the customer s part and automates the design of most other mold features  thus eliminating much of the skilled labor normally associated with mold design in a conventional environment 

table of contents automated tool path generation in support of both our firstcut and protomold services  our proprietary software automates much of the skilled labor conventionally needed to generate the tool paths necessary to machine the required parts and mold components 
our software automation allows our users to do in minutes what can often require hours or days of labor for manufacturers using commercial computer aided manufacturing cam software 
parallel processing the mathematical algorithms required to analyze manufacturability and generate tool paths are computationally intensive 
we have developed a proprietary parallel processing software environment to accelerate the processing of individual jobs and allow straightforward scalability to a large number of jobs 
this software system typically runs on a cluster of industry standard bit computers connected to each other and to our internal users computers over an isolated gigabit ethernet local area network 
we currently have clusters in multiple manufacturing facilities  two in the united states and one each in the united kingdom and japan 
monitoring and control we have developed a proprietary  intranet based monitoring and control system that allows us to monitor key aspects of our entire worldwide operations in real time using an easy to understand management dashboard 
this system provides us with the ability to quickly react to new information across our organization 
marketing our international  integrated marketing effort generates leads for our sales teams and seeks to strengthen our reputation as a leader in the field of quick turn  low volume custom manufacturing 
much of our marketing activities occur over the internet 
we use marketing automation software to enhance the productivity of our sales and marketing teams and to track results of all campaigns to enhance our marketing return on investment 
we maintain brand awareness with product developers through the regular distribution of technical information including design guidelines  engineering white papers and a quarterly journal targeted at product developers 
we also send out product giveaways that highlight technical aspects of injection molding we feel would be of interest to product developers 
we believe these educational materials are key aspects of our lead generation efforts 
in our cool idea marketing program  we plan to award up to a total of  of our services to entrepreneurs with cool ideas 
in addition to supporting entrepreneurs and innovative product development  we believe this program can generate good will  press coverage and word of mouth brand awareness 
sales and customer service we maintain an internal sales team trained in the basics of part design and the capabilities of our manufacturing services  as well as the key advantages of our services over alternative methods of low volume custom parts manufacturing 
we organize our sales team into two complementary roles business development and account management  the former focused on selling to new customer companies and the latter focused on expanding sales within existing customer companies 
we believe our sales staff is adept at researching customer companies and networking to find additional product developers that may have a need for our services 
we also have a team of customer service engineers who can support highly technical engineering discussions with product developers as required during the sales process 
our revenue is generated from a diverse customer base  with no single customer company representing more than approximately of our total revenue in competition the market for low volume custom parts manufacturing is fragmented  highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our potential competitors include captive in house services 
many larger companies undertaking product development have established cnc machining  injection molding or additive rapid prototyping capabilities internally to support the prototyping requirements of their product developers 

table of contents other custom manufacturers 
there are thousands of machine shops and plastic injection molding suppliers worldwide 
the size and scale of these businesses range from very small specialty shops to large  high volume production manufacturers 
alternative manufacturing vendors 
various manufacturing processes  other than cnc machining and injection molding  are offered by other vendors 
we generically refer to the most well known of these processes as additive rapid prototyping  which have been commercialized under labels such as stereolithography  selective laser sintering  fused deposition modeling and d printing 
we believe that the key competitive factors in our industry include speed turnaround time for quotations and parts  price mold and piece part pricing  quality dimensional accuracy  surface finish  material properties  color and cleanliness  capability size and dimensional complexity of the part  materials supported and post processing provided  capacity ability to support multiple part designs in parallel  and service overall customer experience  from web interface to post sales support 
we believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably and have enabled us to become a leader in our markets 
we also believe that substantially all of our current direct competitors are relatively small in terms of size of operations  revenue  number of customers and volume of parts sold  and generally lack our technological capabilities 
however  our industry is evolving rapidly and other companies  including potentially larger and more established companies with developed technological capabilities  may begin to focus on low volume custom parts manufacturing 
these companies could more directly compete with us  along with our existing competitors  and both could also launch new products and services that we do not offer that may quickly gain market acceptance 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to attract customers 
intellectual property we regard our patents  trademarks  service marks  trade dress  trade secrets  copyrights  domain names and other intellectual property as valuable to our business and rely on patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  customers  vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights 
we register our patents  trademarks and service marks in the united states and other jurisdictions  as we deem appropriate 
as of december   we own and have applications pending for patents relating to various aspects of our quoting and manufacturing processes as follows jurisdiction issued patents applications pending united states united kindgom germany our patents have expiration dates ranging from to we also own approximately registered united states trademarks or service marks as of december   with corresponding registered protection in europe and japan for the most important of these marks such as proto labs  protomold  firstcut  protoquote  firstquote and protoflow and corresponding registered protection in australia  canada and mexico for protomold 
there can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate such rights 
we have been subject to claims and expect to be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
in particular  we may face claims from third parties that we have infringed their patents  trademarks or other intellectual property rights 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results 

table of contents employees as of december   we had full time employees 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our current relationship with our employees to be good 
we also regularly use independent contractors and other temporary employees across the organization to augment our regular staff 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract  hire and retain qualified personnel

item a 
risk factors the following are the significant factors that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  or operating results  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
risks relating to our business we face significant competition and expect to face increasing competition in many aspects of our business  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
the market for low volume custom parts manufacturing is fragmented and highly competitive 
we compete for customers with a wide variety of custom parts manufacturers and methods 
some of our current and potential competitors include captive in house services  other custom manufacturers  and alternative manufacturing vendors such as those utilizing stereolithography  selective laser sintering  fused deposition modeling and d printing 
moreover  some of our existing and potential competitors are researching  designing  developing and marketing other types of products and services 
we also expect that future competition may arise from the development of allied or related techniques for custom parts manufacturing that are not encompassed by our patents  from the issuance of patents to other companies that may inhibit our ability to develop certain products and from improvements to existing technologies 
and our competitors may attempt to adopt and improve upon key aspects of our business model  such as development of technology that automates much of the manual labor conventionally required to quote and manufacture low volume custom parts  implementation of interactive web based and automated user interface and quoting systems and or building scalable operating models specifically designed for efficient low volume production 
third party cad software companies may develop software that mold makers  injection molders and cnc machine shops could use to compete with our business model 
additive manufacturers may develop stronger  higher temperature resins or introduce other improvements that could more effectively compete with us on part quality 
we may also  from time to time  establish alliances or relationships with other competitors or potential competitors 
to the extent companies terminate such relationships and establish alliances and relationships with our competitors  our business could be harmed 
existing and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution and other resources and name recognition than us  as well as experience and expertise in intellectual property rights and operating within certain international locations  any of which may enable them to compete effectively against us 
though we plan to continue to expend resources to develop new technologies  processes and services  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition 
our challenge in developing new services is finding services for which our automated quotation and manufacturing processes offer an attractive value proposition  and we may not be able to find any new services with potential economies of scale similar to our molding and machining services 
if we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new technologies  processes and services  the demand for our products and services may decline and our operating results may suffer 

table of contents our success depends on our ability to deliver products and services that meet the needs of product developers and to effectively respond to changes in our industry 
we derive almost all of our revenue from the manufacture and sale to product developers of quick turn low volumes of custom parts for prototyping  support of internal manufacturing and limited quantity product release 
our business has been and we believe will continue to be affected by changes in product developer requirements and preferences  rapid technological change  new product and service introductions and the emergence of new standards and practices  any of which could render our technology  products and services less attractive  uneconomical or obsolete 
to the extent that our customers need for quick turn parts decreases for any reason  it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and harm our competitive position 
in addition  cad simulation and other technologies may reduce the demand for physical prototype parts 
therefore  we believe that to remain competitive  we must continually expend resources to enhance and improve our technology  product offerings and services 
in particular  we plan to increase our research and development efforts and to continue to focus a significant portion of those efforts to further develop our technology in areas such as our interactive user interface and manufacturing processes  potentially introduce new manufacturing processes within the research and development initiative we refer to as protoworks  and broaden the range of parts that we are able to manufacture 
we believe successful execution of this part of our business plan is critical for our ability to compete in our industry and grow our business  and there are no guarantees we will be able to do so in a timely fashion  or at all 
broadening the range of parts we offer is of particular importance since limitations in manufacturability are the primary reason we are not able to fulfill many quotation requests 
there are no guarantees that the resources devoted to executing on this aspect of our business plan will improve our business and operating results or result in increased demand for our products and services 
failures in this area could adversely impact our operating results and harm our reputation and brand 
and even if we are successful in executing in these areas  our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change  and our competitors may develop new technologies  processes and services that are superior to ours 
research and development costs were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k for additional discussion related to research and development costs 
any failure to properly meet the needs of product developers or respond to changes in our industry on a cost effective and timely basis  or at all  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and harm our competitive position 
our failure to meet our product developers expectations regarding quick turnaround time would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we believe many product developers are facing increased pressure from global competitors to be first to market with their finished products  often resulting in a need for quick turnaround of custom parts 
we believe our ability to quickly quote  manufacture and ship custom parts has been an important factor in our results to date 
there are no guarantees we will be able to meet product developers increasing expectations regarding quick turnaround time  especially as we increase the scope of our operations 
if we fail to meet our customers expectations regarding turnaround time in any given period  our business and results of operations will likely suffer 
our failure to meet our product developers price expectations would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
demand for our services is sensitive to price 
we believe our competitive pricing has been an important factor in our results to date 
therefore  changes in our pricing strategies can have a significant impact on our business and ability to generate revenue 
many factors  including our production and personnel costs and our competitors pricing and marketing strategies  can significantly impact our pricing strategies 
if we fail to meet our customers price expectations in any given period  demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted and our business and results of operations could suffer 
the strength of our brand is important to our business  and any failure to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain and expand our customer base as well as further penetrate existing customers 
since our products and services are sold primarily through our websites  the success of our business depends upon our ability to attract new and repeat customers to our websites in order to increase business and grow our revenue 
customer awareness of  and the perceived value of  our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts  as well as our ability to consistently provide quality custom parts within the required timeframes and positive customer experiences  which we may not do successfully 
a primary component of our business strategy is the continued promotion and strengthening of our brand  and we have incurred and plan to continue to incur substantial expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts directed toward enhancing our brand 
we have initiated marketing efforts through social media  but this method of marketing may not be successful and subjects us to a greater risk of inconsistent messaging and bad publicity 
we may choose to increase our branding expense materially  but we cannot be sure that this investment will be profitable 
if we are unable to successfully maintain and enhance our brand  this could have a negative impact on our business and ability to generate revenue 

table of contents our business depends in part on our ability to process a large volume of new part designs from a diverse group of product developers and successfully identify significant opportunities for our business based on those submissions 
we believe the volume of new part designs we process and the size and diversity of our customer base give us valuable insight into the needs of our prospective customers 
we utilize this industry knowledge to determine where we should focus our development resources 
if the number of new part designs we process or the size and diversity of our customer base decrease  our ability to successfully identify significant opportunities for our business and meet the needs of product developers could be negatively impacted 
in addition  even if we do continue to process a large number of new part designs and work with a significant and diverse customer base  there are no guarantees that any industry knowledge we extract from those interactions will be successfully utilized to help us identify significant business opportunities or better understand the needs of product developers 
the loss of one or more key members of our management team or personnel  or our failure to attract  integrate and retain additional personnel in the future  could harm our business and negatively affect our ability to successfully grow our business 
we are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of the key members of our management team and other personnel 
the loss of any of these individuals  each of whom is at will and may terminate his or her employment relationship with us at any time  could disrupt our operations and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives 
we believe that our future success will also depend in part on our continued ability to identify  hire  train and motivate qualified personnel 
we conduct our operations in the united states at our facilities located in the greater metropolitan areas of minneapolis and st 
paul  minnesota 
a possible shortage of qualified individuals in this region might require us to pay increased compensation to attract and retain key employees  thereby increasing our costs 
in addition  we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous companies  many of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources and name recognition than us 
we may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing operational  managerial and other requirements  or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so 
our failure to attract  hire  integrate and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to achieve our business objectives 
if we fail to grow our business as anticipated  our net sales  gross margin and operating margin will be adversely affected 
we are attempting to grow our business substantially 
to this end  we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our business  including investments in our infrastructure  technology  and sales and marketing efforts 
these investments include dedicated facilities expansion and increased staffing  both domestic and international 
if our business does not generate the level of revenue required to support our investment  our net sales and profitability will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to manage our growth and expand our operations successfully  our reputation and brand may be damaged  and our business and results of operations may be harmed 
over the past several years  we have experienced rapid growth 
for example  we have grown from approximately full time employees as of january  to full time employees as of december  we have expanded internationally  including establishing manufacturing operations in europe in and in japan in late in  we added a number of key individuals to our organization 
we expect this growth to continue and the number of countries and facilities from which we operate to continue to increase in the future 
our ability to effectively manage our anticipated growth and expansion of our operations will require us to do  among other things  the following enhance our operational  financial and management controls and infrastructure  human resource policies  and reporting systems and procedures  in particular as we continue our transition as a public company  effectively scale our operations  including accurately predicting the need for additional staffing  successfully identify  recruit  hire  train  maintain  motivate and integrate additional employees  expand our international resources  and expand our facilities and equipment 

table of contents these enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources 
and our growth  combined with the geographical dispersion of our operations  has placed  and will continue to place  a strain on our operational  financial and management infrastructure 
our future financial performance and our ability to execute on our business plan will depend  in part  on our ability to effectively manage any future growth and expansion 
there are no guarantees we will be able to do so in an efficient or timely manner  or at all 
our failure to effectively manage growth and expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  prospects  and reputation and brand  including impairing our ability to perform to our customers expectations 
we may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology  processes and infrastructure to meet the needs of our business 
a key element to our continued growth is the ability to quickly and efficiently quote an increasing number of product developer submissions across geographies and to manufacture the related parts 
this will require us to timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology  processes and infrastructure to meet the needs of our business 
with respect to our websites and quoting technology  it may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve their performance  especially during periods of heavy usage and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases across geographies 
similarly  our manufacturing automation technology may not enable us to process the large numbers of unique designs and efficiently manufacture the related parts in a timely fashion to meet the needs of product developers as our business continues to grow 
any failure in our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology  processes and infrastructure could negatively impact our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  damage our reputation and brand  result in lost revenue  and otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations 
numerous factors may cause us not to maintain the revenue growth that we have historically experienced 
although our revenue has grown from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   we likely will not be able to maintain our historical rate of revenue growth 
we believe that our continued revenue growth will depend on many factors  a number of which are out of our control  including among others  our ability to retain and further penetrate existing customer companies  as well as attract new customer companies  consistently execute on custom part orders in a manner that satisfies product developers needs and provides them with a superior experience  develop new technologies or manufacturing processes  and broaden the range of parts we offer  successfully execute on our international strategy and expand into new geographic markets  capitalize on product developer expectations for access to comprehensive  user friendly e commerce capabilities hours per day days per week  increase the strength and awareness of our brand across geographies  respond to changes in product developer needs  technology and our industry  and react to challenges from existing and new competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to grow our business and revenue  and in addressing the factors above 
our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis 
our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year  and are likely to continue to vary due to a number of factors  some of which are outside of our control 
in addition  our actual or projected operating results may fail to match our past performance 
these events could in turn cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

table of contents our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including those listed below and those identified throughout this risk factors section the development of new competitive systems or processes by others  the entry of new competitors into our market whether by established companies or by new companies  changes in the size and complexity of our organization  including our international operations  levels of sales of our products and services to new and existing customers  the geographic distribution of our sales  changes in product developer preferences or needs  changes in the amount that we invest to develop  acquire or license new technologies and processes  which we anticipate will generally increase and may fluctuate in the future  delays between our expenditures to develop  acquire or license new technologies and processes  and the generation of sales related thereto  our ability to timely and effectively scale our business during periods of sequential quarterly or annual growth  limitations or delays in our ability to reduce our expenses during periods of declining sequential quarterly or annual revenue  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  including our responses to price competition  changes in the amount we spend in our marketing and other efforts  unexpected increases in expenses as compared to our related accounting accruals or operating plan  the volatile global economy  general economic and industry conditions that affect customer demand and product development trends  interruptions to or other problems with our website and interactive user interface  information technology systems  manufacturing processes or other operations  changes in accounting rules and tax and other laws  and plant shutdowns due to a health pandemic or weather conditions 
due to all of the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this risk factors section  you should not rely on quarter to quarter or year to year comparisons of our operating results as an indicator of future performance 

table of contents interruptions to or other problems with our website and interactive user interface  information technology systems  manufacturing processes or other operations could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations 
the satisfactory performance  reliability  consistency  security and availability of our websites and interactive user interface  information technology systems  manufacturing processes and other operations are critical to our reputation and brand  and our ability to effectively service product developers 
any interruptions or other problems that cause any of our websites  interactive user interface or information technology systems to malfunction or be unavailable  or negatively impact our manufacturing processes or other operations  may damage our reputation and brand  result in lost revenue  cause us to incur significant costs seeking to remedy the problem and otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations 
a number of factors or events could cause such interruptions or problems  including among others human and software errors  design faults  challenges associated with upgrades  changes or new facets of our business  power loss  telecommunication failures  fire  flood  extreme weather  political instability  acts of terrorism  war  break ins and security breaches  contract disputes  labor strikes and other workforce related issues  capacity constraints due to an unusually large number of product developers accessing our websites or ordering parts at the same time  and other similar events 
these risks are augmented by the fact that our customers come to us largely for our quick turn manufacturing capabilities and that accessibility and turnaround speed are often of critical importance to these product developers 
we are dependent upon our facilities through which we satisfy all of our production demands and in which we house all of the computer hardware necessary to operate our websites and systems as well as managerial  customer service  sales  marketing and other similar functions  and we have not identified alternatives to these facilities or established fully redundant systems in multiple locations 
however  we have back up computing systems for each of our united states  united kingdom and japanese operations 
in addition  we are dependent in part on third parties for the implementation and maintenance of certain aspects of our communications and production systems  and therefore preventing  identifying and rectifying problems with these aspects of our systems is to a large extent outside of our control 
moreover  the business interruption insurance that we carry may not be sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses  including the potential harm to the future growth of our business  that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
we depend on the continued growth of product developers e commerce expectations when working with their custom parts manufacturers and their migration from d to d cad software 
the business of selling custom parts over the internet via an interactive web based and automated user interface and quoting system is not widespread in our industry 
moreover  many product developers still utilize d cad software 
concerns about privacy and technological and other problems may discourage some product developers from adopting the internet as the medium for procuring their custom parts or adopting d cad software  particularly in countries where e commerce and d cad software are not as prevalent as they are in our current markets or with product developers in industries not well suited to utilize our services  such as architecture 
in order to expand our customer base  we must appeal to and procure customers who historically have used more traditional means of commerce and or d cad drawings to purchase their customer parts 
if product developers are not sufficiently attracted to the value proposition of or satisfied with our web based interface and quotation system  or product developers do not continue to migrate to d cad software as we currently anticipate  our business could be adversely impacted 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the success of our services will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  and security  as well as timely development of complementary products  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands 
in addition  increasing numbers of users  increasing bandwidth requirements  or problems caused by viruses  worms  malware and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet 
the backbone computers of the internet have been the targets of such programs 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services  which could adversely impact our business 
if the security of our customers confidential information stored in our systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access  our reputation or brand may be harmed  and we may be exposed to liability 
our system stores  processes and transmits our customers confidential information  including the intellectual property in their part designs  credit card information and other sensitive data 
we rely on encryption  authentication and other technologies licensed from third parties  as well as administrative and physical safeguards  to secure such confidential information 
any compromise of our information security could damage our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss  costly litigation and liability that would substantially harm our business and operating results 
we may not have adequately assessed the internal and external risks posed to the security of our company s systems and 
table of contents information and may not have implemented adequate preventative safeguards or take adequate reactionary measures in the event of a security incident 
in addition  most states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals and often state authorities of data security breaches involving their personal data 
these mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity  which may cause our existing and prospective customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures 
any security breach  whether successful or not  would harm our reputation and brand and could cause the loss of customers 
global economic conditions may harm our ability to do business  increase our costs and negatively affect our stock price 
the prospects for economic growth in the united states and other countries remain uncertain and could worsen 
economic concerns and other issues such as reduced access to capital for businesses may cause product developers to further delay or reduce the product development projects that our business supports 
given the continued uncertainty concerning the global economy  we face risks that may arise from financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and product developers and other related risks to our business 
we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks 
we have established our operations in the united states  europe and japan and are seeking to further expand our international operations 
as of december   we had sold products into more than countries 
in addition to english  our website is available in british english  french  german  italian  japanese and spanish 
our international revenue accounted for approximately of our total revenue in the year ended december   and of our total revenue in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the future growth and profitability of our international business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
many of the following factors have adversely affected our international operations and sales to customers located outside of the united states and may again in the future difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  particularly in new geographic locations  challenges in providing solutions across a significant distance  in different languages and among different cultures  rapid changes in government  economic and political policies and conditions  political or civil unrest or instability  terrorism or epidemics  and other similar outbreaks or events  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  differences in product developer preferences and means of procuring parts  compliance with and changes in foreign laws and regulations  as well as us laws affecting the activities of us companies abroad  including those associated with export controls  tariffs and embargoes  other trade restrictions and antitrust and data privacy concerns  different  complex and changing laws governing intellectual property rights  sometimes affording companies lesser protection in certain areas  lower levels of use of the internet or d cad software  seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world  particularly during the summer months in europe  higher costs of doing business internationally  interruptions resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local producers and service providers  taxation  
table of contents energy costs  restrictions imposed by local labor practices and laws on our business and operations  workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the united states  transportation delays  and increased payment risk and higher levels of payment fraud 
our business depends on product developers demand for our services  the general economic health of current and prospective customers  and companies desire or ability to make investments in new products 
a deterioration of global  regional or local political  economic or social conditions could affect potential customers in ways that reduce demand for our services  disrupt our manufacturing and sales plans and efforts or otherwise negatively impact our business 
acts of terrorism  wars  public health issues and increased energy costs could disrupt commerce in ways that could impair our ability to get products to our customers and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 
we have not undertaken hedging transactions to cover our foreign currency exposure  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact reported revenue and expenses 
in addition  our sales are often made on unsecured credit terms  and a deterioration of political  economic or social conditions in a given country or region could reduce or eliminate our ability to collect accounts receivable in that country or region 
in any of these events  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes any of our manufacturing facilities  we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales will decline 
we manufacture all of our products in six manufacturing facilities  three of which are located in maple plain  minnesota and one of which is located in each of rosemount  minnesota  telford  united kingdom  and yamato shi  kanagawa  japan 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be harmed by natural or man made disasters  including  without limitation  earthquakes  floods  tornadoes  fires  tsunamis and nuclear disasters 
in the event any of our facilities are affected by a disaster  we may be unable to meet the shipping deadlines of our customers  experience disruptions in our ability to process submissions and generate quotations  manufacture and ship parts  provide sales and marketing support and customer service  and otherwise operate our business  any of which could negatively impact our business  be forced to rely on third party manufacturers  need to expend significant capital and other resources to address any damage caused by the disaster  and lose customers and be unable to regain those customers 
although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if our present single or limited source suppliers become unavailable or inadequate  our customer relationships  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we acquire substantially all of the manufacturing equipment and certain of our materials that are critical to the ongoing operation and future growth of our business from just a few third parties 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers and operate on a purchase order basis 
while most manufacturing equipment and materials for our products are available from multiple suppliers  certain of those items are only available from single or limited sources 
should any of our present single or limited source suppliers for manufacturing equipment or materials 
table of contents become unavailable or inadequate  or impose terms unacceptable to us such as increased pricing terms  we could be required to spend a significant amount of time and expense to develop alternate sources of supply  and we may not be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  may affect our supply of materials  particularly resins  from time to time  and we may purchase larger amounts of certain materials in anticipation of future shortages or increases in pricing 
in addition  if we were unable to find a suitable supplier for a particular type of manufacturing equipment or material  we could be required to modify our existing business processes and offerings to accommodate the situation 
as a result  the loss of a single or limited source supplier could adversely affect our relationship with our customers and our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could impair our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on patents  licenses  trademarks and trade secrets  as well as non disclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes globally 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
as such  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
we may not be able to obtain foreign patents corresponding to our united states patents 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available 
if our patents and other intellectual property do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer services similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
any of the foregoing events would lead to increased competition and lower revenue or gross margin  which would adversely affect our net income 
we may be subject to infringement claims 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from individuals  vendors and other companies who have acquired or developed patents in the fields of cnc machining  injection molding or part production for purposes of developing competing products or for the sole purpose of asserting claims against us 
any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others  regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims  could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to  defending and resolving such claims  and may prohibit or otherwise impair our ability to commercialize new or existing products 
if we are unable to effectively defend our processes  our market share  sales and profitability could be adversely impacted 
our failure to expand our intellectual property portfolio could adversely affect the growth of our business and results of operations 
expansion of our intellectual property portfolio is one of the available methods of growing our revenue and our profits 
this involves a complex and costly set of activities with uncertain outcomes 
our ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property can be adversely affected by insufficient inventiveness of our employees  by changes in intellectual property laws  treaties  and regulations  and by judicial and administrative interpretations of those laws treaties and regulations 
our ability to expand our intellectual property portfolio could also be adversely affected by the lack of valuable intellectual property for sale or license at affordable prices 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain valuable intellectual property in the jurisdictions where we and our competitors operate or that we will be able to use or license that intellectual property 
we may be subject to product liability claims  which could result in material expense  diversion of management time and attention and damage to our business and reputation and brand 
the prototype parts we manufacture and the parts we manufacture in low volumes may contain undetected defects or errors that are not discovered until after the products have been installed and used by customers 
this could result in claims from customers or others  damage to our business and reputation and brand  or significant costs to correct the defect or error 
we attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products 
however  it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  regardless of its merit  could result in material expense  diversion of management time and attention  damage to our business and reputation and brand  and cause us to fail to retain existing customers or to fail to attract new customers 

table of contents government regulation of the internet and e commerce is evolving  and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e commerce 
existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  restrictions on imports and exports  customs  tariffs  user privacy  data protection  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  electronic contracts and other communications  consumer protection  the provision of online payment services  broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property use and ownership  sales and other taxes  fraud  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce  especially where these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the internet or e commerce 
those laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain 
the costs of compliance with these regulations may increase in the future as a result of changes in the regulations or the interpretation of them 
further  any failures on our part to comply with these regulations may subject us to significant liabilities 
those current and future laws and regulations or unfavorable resolution of these issues may substantially harm our business and results of operations 
changes in  or interpretation of  tax rules and regulations may impact our effective tax rate and future profitability 
we are a multinational company based in the united states and subject to tax in multiple tax jurisdictions  both domestic and abroad 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in statutory tax rates or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we do business  changes in the amount of revenue or earnings in the countries with varying statutory tax rates  or by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  we are subject to audits and examinations of previously filed income tax returns by the internal revenue service  or irs  and other domestic and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential impact of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations 
we believe such estimates to be reasonable  however  there is no assurance that the final determination of any examination will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we may require additional capital to support business growth  and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges  including the need to complement our growth strategy  increase market share in our current markets or expand into other markets  or broaden our technology  intellectual property or service capabilities 
accordingly  we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired  and our business may be harmed 
any acquisition  strategic relationship  joint venture or investment could disrupt our business and harm our operating results and financial condition 
our business and our customer base have been built primarily through organic growth 
however  from time to time  we may selectively pursue acquisitions  strategic relationships  joint ventures or investments that we believe may allow us to complement our growth strategy  increase market share in our current markets or expand into other markets  or broaden our technology  intellectual property or service capabilities 
we cannot forecast the number  timing or size of such transactions  or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating or financial results 
we have very limited experience engaging in these types of transactions 
and such transactions may be complex  time consuming and expensive  and may present numerous challenges and risks including 
table of contents an acquired company  asset or technology not furthering our business strategy as anticipated  difficulties entering and competing in new product or geographic markets and increased competition  including price competition  integration challenges  challenges in working with strategic partners and resolving any related disagreements or disputes  overpayment for a company  asset or technology  or changes in the economic or market conditions or assumptions underlying our decision to make an acquisition  significant problems or liabilities  including increased intellectual property and employment related litigation exposure  associated with acquired businesses  assets or technologies  and requirements to record substantial charges and amortization expense related to certain purchased intangible assets  deferred stock compensation and other items  as well as other charges or expenses 
any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions  strategic relationships  joint ventures or investments after we have expended resources on them  as well as divert our management s attention 
and any failure to successfully address these challenges or risks could disrupt our business and harm our operating results and financial condition 
moreover  any such transaction may not be viewed favorably by investors or analysts 
in addition  from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions  relationships  joint ventures or investments that are not ultimately consummated 
these negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time  as well as substantial out of pocket costs 
we depend in part on licenses of technologies from third parties in order to deliver our solutions  and  as a result  our business is dependent in part on the availability of such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
we currently  and will continue to  license certain technologies from third parties 
while these licenses are not material to our financial results  their function in our business is integral to our operations 
we cannot be certain that these third party content licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or that we will be able to successfully integrate the technology into our solutions 
these third party in licenses may expose us to increased risk  including risks associated with the assimilation of new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
the inability to obtain any of these licenses could result in delays in solution development until equivalent technology can be identified and integrated 
any such delays in services could cause our business  operating results and financial condition to suffer 
our business involves the use of hazardous materials  and we and our suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which can be expensive and restrict how we do business 
our business involves the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we and our suppliers are subject to federal  state and local as well as foreign laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these hazardous materials 
although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by us and our suppliers for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident  state  federal or foreign authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations 
we do not currently maintain hazardous materials insurance coverage 
if we are subject to any liability as a result of activities involving hazardous materials  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected and our reputation and brand may be harmed 

table of contents if we are unable to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for the parts we manufacture  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed 
as a manufacturer of cnc machined and injection molded custom parts  we are required to meet certain regulatory standards  including international organization for standardization  or iso  for our manufacturing facilities in minnesota 
if any regulatory inspection reveals that we are not in compliance with applicable standards  regulators may take action against us  including issuing a warning letter  imposing fines on us  requiring a recall of the parts we manufactured or closing our manufacturing facilities 
if any of these actions were to occur  it could harm our reputation as well as our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we may need to obtain additional certifications in the future and there are no guarantees we would be able to do so on a timely basis  if at all 
moreover  obtaining and maintaining required regulatory certifications can be costly and divert management s attention 
we are subject to payment related risks 
we accept payments using a variety of methods  including credit card  customer invoicing  physical bank check and payment upon delivery 
as we offer new payment options to our customers  we may be subject to additional regulations  compliance requirements and fraud risk 
for certain payment methods  including credit and debit cards  we pay interchange and other fees  which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability 
we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services  including the processing of credit cards  debit cards or electronic checks  and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us 
we are also subject to payment card association operating rules  certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers  which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply 
if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements  we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers  process electronic funds transfers  or facilitate other types of online payments  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
risks relating to ownership of our common stock control by our existing shareholders could allow them to collectively control substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval 
currently  our executive officers  directors and our principal existing shareholder  north bridge growth equity i  lp north bridge  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
bradley a 
cleveland  our chief executive officer  and lawrence j 
lukis  our founder and chief technology officer  are each on our board of directors and among our largest shareholders 
in addition  matt blodgett  one of our directors  is a principal at north bridge growth equity  which is an entity affiliated with north bridge 
these shareholders could control us through their board representation or through their ability to determine the outcome of the election of our directors  to amend our articles of incorporation and by laws and to take other actions requiring the vote or consent of shareholders  including mergers  going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions  and the terms of any of these transactions 
the ownership positions of these shareholders may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control or a change in the composition of our board of directors 
these shareholders may also use their large ownership positions to address their own interests  which may be different our other investors 
in addition  sales of shares beneficially owned by these shareholders could be viewed negatively by third parties and have a negative impact on our stock 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
shares of our common stock were sold in our february initial public offering at a price of per share  and  as of december   our common stock had traded as high as and as low as following our initial public offering 
the market for our common stock may become less active  liquid or orderly  which could depress the trading price of our common stock 
some of the factors  many of which are outside of our control  that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results  our ability to retain and attract customers and increase net sales  pricing pressures due to competition or otherwise and changes in gross margins  changes in general economic and market conditions  economic uncertainty and changes in product development activity levels  announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new product or service offerings or significant acquisitions  timing  effectiveness  and costs of expansion and upgrades of our offerings  systems and infrastructure  changes in key personnel  
table of contents success in entry into new markets and expansion efforts  the public s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties  including our filings with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and announcements relating to litigation  the projections we may provide to the public  any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections  the issuance of new or updated research or reports by any securities or industry analysts who follow our common stock  changes in analysts financial estimates or ratings  and failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  significant lawsuits  including patent or shareholder litigation  general economic and market conditions  changes in laws or regulations applicable to us  changes in accounting principles  the sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock  future sales of our common stock by us or our shareholders  including sales by our officers  directors and significant shareholders  share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading levels of our shares  the expiration of contractual lock up agreements  and other events or factors  including those resulting from war  acts of terrorism  natural disasters or responses to these events 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
in the past  shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility 
if we were to become involved in securities litigation  we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 
if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or reports about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends  in part  on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not have any control over these analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock  changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
we are an emerging growth company  and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors 
we are an emerging growth company  as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act jobs act  which was enacted in april for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company  we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies  including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley act  reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote 
table of contents on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved 
we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years  although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier 
we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions 
if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result  there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 
under the jobs act  emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the jobs act until such time as those standards apply to private companies 
we have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and  therefore  will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies 
we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and otherwise comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
this will require significant expenditures and effort by our management  and may not complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner  or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective  which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and  as a result  the value of our common stock 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act and related rules and regulations  and beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ending december   our management will be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual report on form k following the date on which we are no longer an emerging growth company  which may be up to five years following the date of our initial public offering  but could occur as early as our fiscal year ending december  our status as an emerging growth company is discussed in more detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation  testing and possible remediation 
we are currently in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of reviewing  documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting 
we may not be able to complete our evaluation  testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion 
during the evaluation and testing process  if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  in connection with the attestation process by our independent registered public accounting firm  we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial information and our stock price could decline 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and minnesota law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 
our third amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions permit our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  with any rights  preferences and privileges as our board may designate  including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control  provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of the board of directors  provide that all vacancies  including newly created directorships  may  except as otherwise required by law  be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office  even if less than a quorum  provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner  and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder s notice  and do not provide for cumulative voting rights 

table of contents we are subject to the provisions of section a 
of the minnesota statutes  which regulates business combinations 
section a 
generally prohibits any business combination by an issuing public corporation  or any of its subsidiaries  with an interested shareholder  which means any shareholder that purchases or more of the corporation s voting shares within four years following the date the person became an interested shareholder  unless the business combination is approved by a committee composed solely of one or more disinterested members of the corporation s board of directors before the date the person became an interested shareholder 
these anti takeover provisions could discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company  even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 
we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate that we will pay any such cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the business and for general corporate purposes 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
accordingly  if you purchase shares in this offering  realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock  which may never occur
