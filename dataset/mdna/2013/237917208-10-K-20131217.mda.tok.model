item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of part ii of this annual report on form k relating to liquidity and capital resources may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date they are made 
we disclaim any obligation  except as specifically required by law and the rules of the securities and exchange commission  to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based  or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed below and within this annual report on form k  as well as the accuracy of our internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of our risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and related notes thereto 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a weak global economy and softening in the computer software market may result in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth rates the growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the financial services markets and other markets in which we compete 
tighter credit and negative financial news resulting from the recent worldwide recession and  in the us  from the congressional deadlock over the federal debt ceiling and government spending restrictions resulting from the federal budget sequester  may continue to have an adverse effect on capital spending by corporations  including the demand for computer software 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers  poor economic conditions may soften the demand for computer software and services which may result in decreased revenues  lower revenue growth rates and reduced profitability 
in addition  a weak global economy may result in longer sales cycles  reduced  deferred or cancelled orders  or greater than anticipated uncollectible accounts receivables 
in a weakened economy  we cannot be assured that we will be able to effectively promote future growth in our software and services revenues or operate profitability 
our dependence on our principal products and our failure to develop enhanced or new products may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations in the year ended september   our visual data discovery products accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
we are primarily dependent on our visual data discovery products 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of any of these products could have a material adverse effect on us 
our future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of new and enhanced versions of these products and development of new versions of these and other products and subsequent customer acceptance of such new and enhanced products 
in particular  we are dependent upon our ability to successfully market and sell the visual data discovery products that we acquired in connection with our purchase of panopticon in august in addition  competitive pressures or other factors may result in significant price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations our future operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter because of uncertainties and or risks associated with such matters as current economic conditions  technological change  competition  delays in the introduction of new products or product enhancements  and market acceptance of those new products and product enhancements  and general market trends 
in addition  as we focus on increasing enterprise sales to large customers  the timing of significant orders may cause fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
large enterprise sales arrangements often involve multiple elements and may require more complex accounting than the sales transactions we have entered into in the past  which also makes projecting future operating results more difficult 
historically  we have operated with minimal backlog of orders because our software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
further  any increases in sales under our subscription sales model or cloud offering could result in decreased revenues over the short term 
because our staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our costs are fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  at september   we had approximately  of unrecognized compensation costs related to rsus  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  which costs will have a negative effect on our profitability on a gaap reporting basis 
because of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we can give no assurance that we will not experience such variations in operating results in the future or that such variations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the sales cycle for our enterprise products is long and unpredictable  particularly with respect to large customers  and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense our operating results may fluctuate  in part  because of the resource intensive nature of our sales efforts  the length and variability of the sales cycle of our enterprise software licensing offerings and the short term difficulty in adjusting our operating expenses 
our operating results depend in part on sales to large customers and conversions of users that have downloaded the desktop version of our datawatch modeler software into enterprise customers 
the length of our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of and payment for the software license  varies substantially from customer to customer 
it is difficult to predict exactly when  or even if  we will make a sale with a potential customer or if a user that has licensed desktop versions of our datawatch modeler software will upgrade to a larger server license 
as a result  large individual sales may  in some cases  occur in quarters subsequent to those we anticipate  or not at all 
the loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could impact our operating results for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is delayed 
as a result of these factors  it is difficult for us to forecast our revenues accurately in any quarter 
because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  our operating results will suffer if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the market for our data visualization products is emerging and may not grow because the market for our visual data discovery products is still emerging  it is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewal rates  customer demand for our enterprise software licenses  the size and growth rate of this market  the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products 
any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors  including the cost  performance and perceived value associated with such software licenses 
if the market for our enterprise software licenses does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for software in this market caused by a lack of customer acceptance  technological challenges  competing technologies and products  decreases in corporate spending  weakening economic conditions  or otherwise  it could result in reduced customer orders  early terminations  reduced renewal rates or decreased revenues  any of which would adversely affect our business operations and financial results 
dependence on new product introductions and new product delays or defects could have a material adverse effect on our business the market for visual data discovery products is evolving rapidly 
growth in our business depends in substantial part on the continuing introduction of new products  such as the products we acquired when we purchased panopticon  to address the emerging needs of this market 
the length of product life cycles depends in part on end user demand for new or additional functionality in our products and our ability to update our products to meet such demands 
if we fail to accurately anticipate the demand for  or encounter any significant delays in developing or introducing  new products or additional functionality in our products  there could be a material adverse effect on our business 
our product life cycles can also be affected if suppliers of software systems with which we interact introduce new or changed functionality within their products 
our failure to anticipate the introduction of additional functionality in products developed by such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our competitors may introduce products with more features and lower prices than our products 
such increase in competition could adversely affect the life cycles of our products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 
software products  whether developed internally or licensed from third parties  may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by us and by current and potential end users  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the market price of our stock has been and may continue to be volatile as has recently been the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
in addition  insiders presently hold a significant percentage of our stock  and our shares are thinly traded in the public market 
we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our acquisition of panopticon  and approximately of those shares remain subject to lock up restrictions until february  unless we waive the restrictions before then  with approximately of such shares having been released from the lock up restrictions on december  we may issue up to an additional  shares or our common stock in connection with the panopticon acquisition in november that were held back at closing for a period of months to secure indemnification obligations of the panopticon sellers under the share purchase agreement 
the sale of a substantial number of our shares by the former stockholders of panopticon or our other stockholders within a short period of time following the expiration or waiver of the six month restricted transfer period could cause our stock price to decline  making it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock or to acquire other businesses using our common stock as consideration 
in addition  factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating companies acquired by us  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock 
even though we do not presently provide forecasts of our future financial performance  any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
finally  to maintain our stock listing with nasdaq  we must be in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rules 
if we are not able to maintain compliance with these rules  and if our common stock does not qualify for  or is subsequently delisted from  the nasdaq capital market  investors may have difficulty converting their investment into cash efficiently 
the price of our common stock and the ability of holders to sell such stock would be adversely affected 
a significant percentage of our total revenue is subject to risks associated with international sales in the years ended september   and  international sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
we have recently expanded our presence in europe and in asia pacific  including the opening of an office in singapore  and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant  and perhaps increasing  percentage of our total revenue 
a significant portion of our total revenue will therefore be subject to risks associated with international sales  including deterioration of international economic conditions  unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  currency exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  possible effects of war and acts of terrorism  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse foreign tax consequences 
our recent acquisition of panopticon  or any future acquisitions  may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention integrating the operations of panopticon successfully or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of panopticon  including additional revenue opportunities  involves a number of challenges 
the failure to meet these integration challenges could seriously harm our results of operations  and the market price of our common stock may decline as a result 
realizing the benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the integration of technology  operations  personnel and sales activity of the two companies 
these integration activities are complex and time consuming  and we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs  including challenges in combining product offerings  including integration of the underlying technology  and sales and marketing activities  our inability to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated in the transaction  which would prevent us from achieving the positive earnings gains expected as a result of the transaction  diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to integration matters  difficulties in consolidating and rationalizing information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures  complexities in managing a larger and more geographically dispersed company than before the completion of transaction  difficulties in the assimilation of panopticon personnel and the integration of two business cultures  challenges in demonstrating to our customers and to customers of panopticon that the transaction will not result in adverse changes in product and technology offerings  customer service standards or business focus  and possible cash flow interruption or loss of revenue as a result of change of ownership transitional matters 
we may not successfully integrate the operations of panopticon in a timely manner  and we may not realize the anticipated net reductions in costs and expenses and other benefits and synergies of the acquisition of panopticon to the extent  or in the timeframe  anticipated 
in addition to the integration risks discussed above  our ability to realize the benefits and synergies of the acquisition of panopticon could be adversely impacted by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations 
as a privately held  non us company  panopticon has not had to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of for internal control and other procedures 
bringing panopticon s systems into compliance with those requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional expense 
in addition  the integration process may cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our business after completion of the transaction 
if our management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process  our business could suffer and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 
in the future  we could acquire additional products  technologies or businesses  or enter into joint venture arrangements  for the purpose of complementing or expanding our business and to address the need to develop new products 
any such acquisitions are likely to involve similar risks to those relating to our acquisition of panopticon 
there may be limitations on the effectiveness of our controls our management does not expect that our internal controls will prevent all errors 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues  if any  within our company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and no assurance can be given that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or intentional conduct may occur and not be detected 
we face significant competition in the software industry our acquisition of panopticon  and the integration of its visual data discovery capabilities with our existing product line  brings us into closer competition with other companies in the big data and business analytics market 
this market is highly competitive and includes companies such as tableau software  tibco spotfire a subsidiary of tibco software inc and qlik technologies  inc  as well as larger technology companies such as ibm  sap  microstrategy  sas and oracle 
many of the competitors in this market have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than we do 
no assurance can be given that the combined business will have the resources required to compete successfully in the future 
in addition  many of these competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business analytics industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
if we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  the business  results of operations and financial condition of the combined business would be harmed 
our success is dependent on proprietary software technology our success is dependent upon proprietary software technology 
we do not own patents on any such technology and we rely principally on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our rights to such proprietary technology 
despite such precautions  there can be no assurance that such steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of such technology 
we may not be able to hire and retain highly skilled employees  which could affect our ability to compete effectively because our business is technology based qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly technical personnel and product development and professional services personnel  sales and marketing personnel and other senior personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are integral to our product development  professional services and sales and marketing teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
we have hired a number of key executives during the past three years  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and key executives in sales and marketing functions 
in addition  a number of key employees have joined us as a result of our acquisition of panopticon  including willem de geer  the managing director of panopticon 
a loss of these personnel or other changes in key management could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec regulations as well as the listing standards of the nasdaq stock market  have created and are continuing to create uncertainty for public companies 
we continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs incurred or the timing of such costs 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we have invested resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards 
this investment has and may continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and we may be harmed 
the failure of indirect distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we sell a significant portion of our products through distributors  value added resellers  oems and other business partners  none of which are under our direct control 
the loss of major distributors or resellers of our products  or a significant decline in their sales  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we have consolidated our use of indirect distribution channels with a single distributor  lifeboat distribution  which accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal and  respectively  ingram micro  inc accounted for less than of our total revenue 
in  ingram micro  inc accounted for approximately  respectively  of our total revenue 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain qualified distributors or resellers or that lifeboat distribution or any other distributors or resellers will be able to effectively sell our products 
we seek to select and retain distributors and resellers on the basis of their business credentials and their ability to add value through expertise in specific vertical markets or application programming expertise 
in addition  we may rely on resellers to provide post sales service and support  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect our business 
failure to maintain an adequate sales returns reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations revenue from the sale of all our software products when separately sold is generally recognized at the time of shipment 
we estimate and maintain reserves for potential future product returns from distributors based on our experience and history with our various distributors and resellers as well as by monitoring inventory levels at such companies 
while actual returns have historically been within the range estimated by management  future actual results could differ from the reserve for sales returns recorded  and this difference could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our subscription sales model for our enterprise products could result in decreased or delayed revenues and cash flows we sell our enterprise products through the sale of perpetual licenses and through a subscription pricing model 
the subscription pricing model allows customers to use our products at a lower initial cost of software acquisition when compared to the more traditional perpetual license sale 
although the subscription sales model is designed to increase the number of enterprise solutions sold and also reduce dependency on short term sales by building a recurring revenue stream  it introduces increased risks for us primarily associated with the timing of revenue recognition and reduced cash flows 
the subscription model delays revenue recognition when compared to the typical perpetual license sale and also  as we allow termination of certain subscriptions with days notice  it could result in decreased revenue for solutions sold under the model if we experience a high percentage of subscription cancellations following the first months of the subscription 
further  as amounts due from customers are invoiced over the life of the subscription  there are delayed cash flows from subscription sales when compared to perpetual license sales 
if our security measures are breached or other unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained  our software may be perceived as not being secure  customers may reduce the use of or stop using our software  and we may incur significant liabilities our software involves the storage and transmission of customer data  and security breaches could result in the loss of this information  litigation  indemnity obligations and other liability 
while we have taken steps to protect the confidential information that we have access to  including confidential information we may obtain through our customer support services or customer usage of our products  we do not have the ability to monitor or review the content that our customers store  and therefore  we have no direct control over the substance of that content 
therefore  if customers use our software for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable information and our security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance or otherwise  our reputation could be damaged  our business may suffer  and we could incur significant liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and increase engagement by existing customers  cause existing customers to elect to not renew their subscriptions  or subject us to third party lawsuits  regulatory fines or other action or liability  thereby adversely affecting our financial results 
we may require additional capital to grow our business  and our financing arrangements expose us to interest rate and default risk our business may require additional capital to operate and expand 
we have historically relied upon cash generated from operations and bank credit lines to satisfy our capital needs and finance growth 
if we determine in the future to make significant investments in our business  including by acquiring assets or businesses from third parties  we may attempt to raise additional funds by securing additional debt financing or selling equity securities in either the public or the private markets 
as the financial markets change and new regulations come into effect  the cost of acquiring financing and the methods of financing may change 
we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional equity financing  our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the value of shares of our common stock could decline 
if we engage in debt financing  we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to make acquisitions 
our inability to do any of the foregoing could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital  or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our needs 
our current credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit our ability to borrow or limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities or conditions and may also expose us to a risk of default if we fail to comply with such covenants 
these financing instruments involve variable rate debt  thus exposing us to risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
such fluctuations in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our business 
catastrophic events may adversely affect our business our company is a highly automated business which relies on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications  internal technology systems and website for development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major storm  earthquake  fire  telecommunications failure  cyber attack  terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  reputational harm  delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and services and other critical functions of our business

our software products are generally sold in multiple element arrangements which may include software licenses  professional services  educational services and customer support 
in such multiple element arrangements  we apply the residual method in determining revenue to be allocated to the software license 
in applying the residual method  we deduct from the sale proceeds the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the professional services  educational services and customer support in determining the residual fair value of the software license 
the vsoe of fair value of the services and customer support is based on the amounts charged for these elements when sold separately 
professional services include advanced modeling  application design  implementation and configuration and process optimization with revenue recognized as the services are performed 
these services are generally delivered on a time and materials basis  are billed on a current basis as the work is performed  and do not involve modification or customization of the software or any other unusual acceptance clauses or terms 
customer support is typically provided under a maintenance agreement which provides technical support and rights to unspecified software maintenance updates and bug fixes on a when and if available basis 
revenue from customer support services is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of support generally one year 
such deferred amounts are recorded as part of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we also license our enterprise software using a subscription model 
at the time a customer enters into a binding agreement to purchase a subscription  the customer is invoiced for an initial day service period and an account receivable and deferred revenue are recorded 
beginning on the date the software is installed at the customer site and available for use by the customer  and provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition are met  the deferred revenue amount is recognized ratably over the period the service is provided 
the customer is then invoiced every days and revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the subscription 
the subscription arrangement includes software  maintenance and unspecified future upgrades including major version upgrades on a when and if available basis 
the subscription renewal rate is the same as the initial subscription rate 
subscriptions can be cancelled by the customer at any time by providing days prior written notice following the first year of the subscription term 
our software products are sold under warranty against certain defects in material and workmanship for a period of days from the date of purchase 
we also offer a day money back guarantee on our datawatch modeler product sold directly to end users 
additionally  we provide our distributors with stock balancing rights 
revenue from the sale of software products to distributors and resellers is recognized at the time of shipment providing all other criteria for revenue recognition as stated above are met and i the distributor or reseller is unconditionally obligated to pay for the products  including no contingency as to product resale  ii the distributor or reseller has independent economic substance apart from us  iii we are not obligated for future performance to bring about product resale  and iv the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
our experience and history with our distributors and resellers allows for reasonable estimates of future returns 
among other things  estimates of potential future returns are made based on the inventory levels at  and the returns history with  the various distributors and resellers  which we monitor frequently 
once the estimates of potential future returns from all sources are made  we determine if we have adequate returns reserves to cover anticipated returns and the returns reserve is adjusted as required 
adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenue in the period of adjustment 
actual returns have historically been within the range estimated by us 
our returns reserves were approximately  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  and  as of september  and  respectively 
income taxes we have deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that expire at different times through and until at september   we had us federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately  expiring at various dates through  including approximately  resulting from the mergence acquisition undertaken during which are subject to additional annual limitations as a result of the changes in mergence s ownership  and had approximately  in state tax loss carryforwards  which also expire at various dates through approximately  of the net operating loss carryforwards relate to tax deductions from stock based compensation  which will be recorded as additional paid in capital when realized 
an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately  is available to offset future regular federal taxes 
research and development credits of approximately  expire beginning in in addition  we have the following foreign net operating loss carryforwards uk losses of approximately  with no expiration date  australia losses of approximately  with no expiration date  germany losses of approximately  with no expiration date  singapore losses of approximately  with no expiration date  and sweden losses of approximately  with no expiration date 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
factors such as future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  changes in enacted tax rates and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable are considered in making these determinations 
we do not believe the deferred tax assets in all of our jurisdictions  with the exception of sweden  are more likely than not to be realized and therefore a full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets in the us  us  australia  germany  and singapore at september  and management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and  if current economic conditions change or future results of operations are better than expected  future assessments may result in us concluding that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are realizable 
if this conclusion were reached  the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be reduced resulting in a tax benefit being recorded for financial reporting purposes 
total net deferred tax assets subject to the full valuation allowance were approximately  as of september  we follow the accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions 
the comprehensive model addresses the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
in accordance with these requirements  we first determine whether a tax authority would more likely than not sustain our tax position if it were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information 
for those tax positions that meet this threshold  we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis  but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because  in certain cases  tax law is subject to varied interpretation  and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain 
the actual outcome of our tax positions  if significantly different from our estimates  could materially impact the financial statements 
at october   we had a cumulative tax liability of approximately  related to foreign tax exposure 
during each of the fiscal years ended september  and  we increased our tax liability by approximately  during the fiscal year ended september   we increased our uncertain tax liability by approximately  resulting in a cumulative tax liability of approximately  at september  these amounts have been recorded in other long term liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize certain software development costs as well as purchased software upon achieving technological feasibility of the related products 
software development costs incurred and software purchased prior to achieving technological feasibility are charged to engineering and product development expense as incurred 
commencing upon initial product release  capitalized costs are amortized to cost of software licenses using the straight line method over the estimated life of the product which approximates the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  which is generally to months 
the net amount of capitalized software development costs was approximately  and  at september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we capitalized approximately  of software development costs related to products developed in fiscal year goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
indefinite lived intangibles are intangible assets whose useful lives are indefinite in that their lives extend beyond the foreseeable horizon that is there is no foreseeable limit on the period of time over which they are expected to contribute to the cash flows of the reporting entity 
we account for these items in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb  under which goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate possible impairment 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of panopticon software  ab and subsidiaries panopticon  a privately held swedish company specializing in the delivery of real time visual data discovery solutions  for a purchase price of approximately  paid primarily in shares of datawatch common stock 
in addition  approximately  of total acquisition costs were incurred in fiscal year and are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the internally developed technology asset of panopticon is being amortized to cost of software licenses using the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset  which is seven and one half years 
other intangible assets consist of assembled workforce  customer relationships which is amortized to sales and marketing expense and trade name which is amortized to general and administrative expense 
the values allocated to customer relationships and trade name are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated life of the related asset 
goodwill and assembled workforce are considered indefinite lived intangibles and are not amortized but instead are tested for tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate possible impairment 
on march   we acquired the intellectual property underlying our datawatch modeler formerly monarch professional and datawatch automator formerly data pump products for a purchase price of approximately  and capitalized approximately  in closing costs and adjustments 
the intellectual property assets are being amortized to cost of software licenses using the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset  which is five years 
intangible asset amounts amortized to sales and marketing expense totaled approximately   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
intangible asset amounts amortized to interest income and other income expense  net totaled approximately  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
there were no intangible asset amounts amortized to interest income and other income expense  net in fiscal year intangible asset amounts amortized to general and administrative expense totaled approximately  for fiscal there were no intangible assets amortized to general and administrative for fiscal years and we review goodwill and intangible assets annually during the fourth quarter of every year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of our long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
no impairment charges were taken for goodwill and intangible assets during fiscal year accounting for share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require that all share based awards  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value at date of grant 
we recognize the fair value of share based awards over the requisite service period of the individual awards  which generally equals the vesting period 
for the fiscal year ended september   we recorded share based compensation expense of approximately  at september   we had approximately  of unrecognized compensation costs related to rsus  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we use an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
we believe this approach results in a reasonable estimate of volatility 
there were  options granted during the fiscal year ended september  for the most recent stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended september   we used an expected stock price volatility of based upon the historical volatility at the time of issuance 
with regard to the expected option life assumption  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting  realizable value and short time to maturity effect 
for the most recent stock option grants issued during the year ended september   we used an expected option life assumption of years 
with regard to the forfeiture rate assumption  we review historical voluntary turnover rates 
for the most recent stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended september   we used an annual estimated forfeiture rate of 
additional expense will be recorded if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated  and a recovery of prior expense will be recorded if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
we also periodically grant awards of restricted stock units rsus to each of our non employee directors and some of our employees on a discretionary basis pursuant to our stock compensation plans 
each rsu entitles the holder to receive  at the end of each vesting period  a specified number of shares of our common stock 
each rsu vests at the rate of on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date 
additionally  some of the rsus are subject to a further vesting condition that our common stock must trade at prices greater than certain minimum per share prices on a national securities exchange for a period of twenty consecutive days prior to the fourth or fifth anniversary of the grant date depending on the grant 
for such rsus  we apply the monte carlo option pricing model for determining the fair value on the date of grant

in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu simplifies how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment which improve consistency in impairment testing requirements among long lived asset categories 
these amended standards permit an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
for assets in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards

in june  the financial accounting standards board issued an asu that provides amendments on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and the total of comprehensive income 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the amendments do not change the option for an entity to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects  with one amount shown for the aggregate income tax expense or benefit related to the total of other comprehensive income items 
in both cases  the tax effect for each component must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements or presented in the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
the amendments do not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
this amendment was effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 
this asu was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal and we elected the two statement approach

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at september   we did not participate in or hold any derivative financial instruments or commodity instruments 
we hold no investment securities that possess significant market risk 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposure is foreign currency exchange rate risk 
international revenues and expenses are generally transacted by our foreign subsidiaries and are denominated in local currency 
approximately  and of our revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  were from foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  approximately  and of our operating expenses for fiscal  and  respectively  were from foreign subsidiaries 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in conducting business globally in several currencies  of which the most significant to our operations has historically been the british pound 
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of our international subsidiaries are almost exclusively conducted in their respective local currencies  and dollar advances to our international subsidiaries  if any  are usually considered to be of a long term investment nature 
accordingly  the majority of currency movements are reflected in our other comprehensive income loss 
there are  however  certain situations where we will invoice customers in currencies other than our own 
such gains or losses from operating activity  whether realized or unrealized  are reflected in foreign currency transaction losses gains in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency transaction loss for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively  was approximately  and  foreign currency transaction gain for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  currently  we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
