item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we manage our business and report revenue and profit loss in three segments core products  emerging products and games 
within core products  our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our software as a service saas offerings  within emerging products  our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our realplayer media player software and from the associated distribution of third party products  and within our games segment  revenue is derived primarily from subscriptions and license fees 
we report common corporate overhead expenses  including finance  legal  headquarters facilities and stock compensation costs  in the aggregate as corporate results 
our most significant expenses relate to cost of revenue  compensating employees  and selling and marketing our products and services 
in our consolidated revenue declined by million compared with we experienced declines in revenue in all three of our segments  with the largest declines occurring in our core products and games segments 
our saas business within core products continues to experience competitive pricing pressure from carriers and the proliferation of smartphone applications and services  some of which do not depend on our carrier customers for distribution to consumers 
in addition  we are still experiencing pricing pressure from carriers for our intercarrier messaging services  which prevents this revenue from rising in spite of increased usage of our services 
our emerging products segment is experiencing declines in revenue as a result of market saturation related to third party software products we distribute 
in our games segment and in the general games market  consumer s game play continues to shift from downloadable pc games and online game subscriptions  where we currently generate of overall games revenues  to social networks and mobile devices 
since  we have been focusing on developing social games and monetizing social game play experiences 
however  the revenue we currently generate from social games is not a significant portion of our games revenue 
in the second quarter of we completed the sale of certain patents  patent applications and related rights and assets relating to our next generation video codec technologies to intel corporation 
we received gross cash consideration of million from the sale  and reported the sales proceeds  net of related direct costs  as a gain in the statement of operations 
this gain accounts for the material improvement in our operating income loss and net income loss for  compared with we continue to focus on aligning our operating expenses with our revenue profile  and in the third quarter of we announced we would be eliminating approximately positions worldwide  with the reductions expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of in the third quarter of we also assigned two of our existing domestic carrier service contracts for ringback tone  ring tone  and music on demand services to a third party 
these actions contributed to the recording of restructuring charges totaling million in summary of results consolidated results of operations were as follows dollars in thousands change change change change total revenue cost of revenue impairment of deferred costs gross profit gross margin sale of patent assets and other technology assets  net of costs total operating expenses operating income loss compared with revenue decreased by million  or 
the reduction in revenue resulted from a decline of million in our core products segment  a decline of million in our games segment  and a decline of million in our emerging products segment  due to the factors described above 
cost of revenue decreased by million compared with the year earlier period due primarily to the decline in revenue  partially offset by a decrease of million in royalty expense in the year prior  due to a change in estimates of our accrued royalties 
operating expenses improved by million due primarily to reduced personnel and related costs of million and reduced marketing expenses of million  due to our ongoing work to align our operating expenses with our revenue profile 
these declines were partially offset by an increase of million in restructuring costs and losses on excess office facilities  in addition to a benefit in of million related to an insurance reimbursement for previously settled litigation that reduced expenses during the quarter ended march  compared with revenue decreased by million  or

gross margin increased primarily due to the impairments of deferred costs of million within the year ended december   related to certain contracts with carrier customers for which the total estimated costs exceeded the total estimated revenues expected to be recognized

music we currently own approximately of rhapsody  which provides products and services that enable consumers to have unlimited access to digital music content anytime from a variety of devices 
rhapsody currently generates revenue primarily in the us through subscriptions to its music services  and sales of tracks and advertising 
as described in detail in note  rhapsody joint venture  on march   we completed the restructuring of rhapsody  which at that time  resulted in our ownership interest in rhapsody decreasing to approximately and the loss of our operating control over rhapsody 
our revenue and operating results for the first quarter of includes results from rhapsody s operations  as during that time we owned of rhapsody and their results were included in our financial statements 
beginning with the second quarter of  rhapsody s revenue and other operating results are no longer consolidated within our financial statements and we have not been recording any operating or other financial results for the music segment 
starting with the second quarter of  we account for our investment in rhapsody using the equity method of accounting for investments 
our share of rhapsody s accounting losses for the years ended december  and were million and million

the net gain from the sale of patents and other technology assets to intel corporation of million in reflects the cash proceeds of million in the second quarter  less million of direct transaction expenses incurred during the first and second quarters 
operating expenses increased by million  or 
the increase compared with the prior period was primarily due to increased restructuring costs and losses on excess office facilities totaling million  and to the impact of a benefit in of million related to an insurance reimbursement for previously settled litigation that reduced expense in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in personnel and related costs of million in  which resulted from our ongoing work to align our operating expenses with our revenue profile

impairment of deferred costs we assess the recoverability of all deferred project costs on a quarterly basis 
as of december   we determined that the total estimated costs associated with certain carrier customer projects exceeded the total estimated revenues expected to be recognized on those projects 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies deferred costs  for more information 
no such charges existed in or restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges in  and consist of costs associated with the ongoing reorganization of our business operations and focus on aligning our operating expenses with our revenue profile 
the expense amounts in all three years primarily relate to severance costs due to workforce reductions 
for additional details on these charges see note  restructuring charges 
loss on excess office facilities as a result of the reduction in use of realnetworks office space  primarily in the corporate headquarters in seattle  washington  and certain other locations  losses have been recognized representing rent and contractual operating expenses over the remaining life of the leases  and related write downs of leasehold improvements to their estimated fair value

other income expense  net decreased million during due primarily to the million one time gain in on the deconsolidation of rhapsody 
this was partially offset by a decrease in equity loss for our investment in rhapsody of million 
since march   we have not held a controlling interest in rhapsody and we no longer consolidate rhapsody s results with our own 
starting with the second quarter of  we account for our investment in rhapsody using the equity method of accounting for investments 
the net carrying value of our investment in rhapsody is not necessarily indicative of the underlying fair value of our investment 
income taxes during the years ended december    and  we recognized income tax expense of million and income tax benefits of million and million  respectively  related to us and foreign income taxes 
the tax expense in the year ended december  was largely the result of the sale of certain patent assets and other technology assets to intel corporation for gross cash consideration of million in the tax benefit in the year ended december  was largely the result of a release in our valuation allowance relating to significant known income expected in due to the then pending patent sale to intel 
the income tax benefit in was largely the result of the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and the restructuring of rhapsody 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered based upon our consideration of many factors  including the current economic climate  our expectations of future taxable income  our ability to project such income  and the appreciation of our investments and other assets 
we maintain a partial valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding their realization as of december  the net decrease in the valuation allowance since december  of million was primarily the result of an million decrease due to unrealized gains on investments  and a million decrease due to changes in worldwide attributes and other assets 
we generate income in a number of foreign jurisdictions  some of which have higher tax rates and some of which have lower tax rates relative to the us federal statutory rate 
changes to the blend of income between jurisdictions with higher or lower effective tax rates than the us federal statutory rate could affect our effective tax rate 
for the year ended december   decreases in tax expense from income generated in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in comparison to the us federal statutory rate were offset by increases in tax expense from income generated in foreign jurisdictions having comparable  or higher tax rates in comparison to the us federal statutory rate 
as such  the effect of differences in foreign tax rates on our tax expense for the year ended december  was minimal 
as of december  and  we had million and million of unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is the result of a release of million through the successful defense of our positions  and ultimate settlement and closure of foreign and state tax examinations 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized was million as of december  and million as of december  we do not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months 
we file numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the us including federal  state and local  as well as foreign jurisdictions 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations for tax years before or state  local  or foreign income tax examinations for years before we are currently under audit by various states and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years subsequent to geographic revenue revenue by geographic region was as follows dollars in thousands change change change change united states europe rest of world total revenue compared with revenue in the us declined by million  or

the higher amount of cash used in operating activities for compared to was primarily due to the decline in revenues of million for compared with the prior year  which was partially offset by a decline in cost of revenue and operating expenses of million for we also had a net decrease in cash of million for the year ended december  related to changes in certain operating assets and liabilities  compared with a net decrease in cash of million for the year ended december  related to changes in certain operating assets and liabilities  excluding the non cash impact of the impairment of deferred costs 
the lower amount of cash used in operating activities for compared to was primarily due to the decline in revenues of million for compared with being more than offset by the decline in cost of revenue and operating expenses of million for for the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities of million was due to the net cash proceeds of million received from the sale of certain patents and other technology assets to intel corporation in the second quarter  and cash proceeds of million related to the sale of certain equity and other investments  offset in part by purchases of equipment  software and leasehold improvements totaling million  and purchases  net of sales and maturities  of short term investments of million 
the net cash proceeds from the sale of certain patent and other technology assets to intel corporation were invested in liquid securities in the us for the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities of million was due primarily from the sales and maturities  net of purchases  of short term investments of million  offset by purchases of equipment  software and leasehold improvements of million and the payment of acquisition costs  net of cash acquired  of million 
for the year ended december   investing activities used cash primarily for payments made in connection with the restructuring of rhapsody of million  purchases of equipment  software  and leasehold improvements of million  as well as a million payment of acquisition costs for backstage  net of cash acquired 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the repayment of temporary funding upon the deconsolidation of rhapsody of approximately million 
purchases  net of sales and maturities  of short term investments provided cash of million during financing activities for the year ended december   provided cash from the proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from sales of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan  offset partially by tax payments from shares withheld upon the vesting of employee restricted stock 
financing activities for the year ended december  used cash mainly from the payment of the special dividend to the holders of our common stock of million 
financing activities in the year ended december  provided cash from the proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from sales of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million 
the declaration and payment of future dividends  as well as the amount thereof  are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  capital levels  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends in the future 
we currently have no planned significant capital expenditures for other than those in the ordinary course of business 
in the future  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing  or through other sources such as credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  in the future  we may enter into cash or stock acquisition transactions or other strategic transactions that could reduce cash available to fund our operations or result in dilution to shareholders 
our principal future cash commitments include office leases 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist of investment grade securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one non us government or non us agency issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates on the securities in this portfolio 
we conduct our operations primarily in five functional currencies the us dollar  the korean won  the japanese yen  the british pound and the euro 
we currently do not hedge the majority of our foreign currency exposures and are therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we invoice our international customers primarily in us dollars  except for certain countries where we invoice our customers primarily in the respective foreign currencies 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from intercompany payables and receivables to and from our foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   approximately million of the million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the us  we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
additionally  realnetworks currently has significant net operating losses and other tax attributes that could be used to offset most potential us income tax that could result if these amounts were distributed to the us we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes on repatriation of amounts held outside of the u 
s to have a material effect on our overall liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
as of december   we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  since such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these amounts were distributed to the u 
s  in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise  we could be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability or benefit on such earnings due to the timing of such future distributions  the availability of foreign tax credits  and the complexity of the computation if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be repatriated  an additional provision for us income and foreign withholding taxes  net of foreign tax credits  may be necessary 
at december   we had commitments to make the following payments contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands office leases other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations other contractual obligations relate to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the amounts above as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 
as of december  we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations for office facility leases with future cash commitments that are not required to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  these operating lease obligations constitute off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  since we do not maintain accruals associated with certain guarantees  as discussed in note  guarantees  those guarantee obligations also constitute off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition  estimating music publishing rights and music royalty accruals  estimating recoverability of deferred costs  estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating losses on excess office facilities  valuation of equity method investments  valuation of long lived assets  valuation of goodwill  stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
physical products are considered delivered to the customer once they have been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for online sales  the products or services are considered delivered at the time the product or services are made available  digitally  to the end user 
we recognize revenue on a gross or net basis 
in most arrangements  we contract directly with end user customers  and are the primary obligor 
in such arrangements  we recognize revenue on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers 
in such instances  we recognize revenue on a net basis 
in our direct to consumer business segments  we derive revenue through subscriptions of superpass within our core products segment and subscriptions sold by our games segment  sales of content downloads  software and licenses offered by our core products  emerging products and games segments and the sale of advertising and the distribution of third party products on our websites and in our games 
consumer subscription products are paid in advance  typically for monthly  quarterly or annual duration 
subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription time period 
revenue from sales of content downloads  software and licenses is recognized at the time the product is made available  digitally  to the end user 
revenue generated from advertising on our websites and from advertising and the distribution of third party products included in our products is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery 
we also generate revenue through business to business channels by providing services within our core products segment enabling mobile carriers to deliver audio and video content to their customers and by selling software licenses and products and related support and other services 
revenue generated from services provided to mobile carriers that enable the delivery of audio and video content to their customers is recognized as the services are provided 
setup fees to build these services are recognized ratably upon launch of the service over the remaining expected term of the service 
non software revenue arrangements containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting  after being evaluated for specific criteria 
if the criteria for separation are met  revenue is allocated to the individual units using the relative price method 
if the criteria are not met  the elements are treated as one unit of accounting and revenue recognition is delayed until all elements have been delivered 
in the case of revenue arrangements containing software  elements are divided into separate units of accounting only when vendor specific objective evidence has been established 
in cases where vendor specific objective evidence has not been established  undelivered elements are combined into one unit of accounting and are not recognized in revenue until all elements have been delivered 
estimating music publishing rights and music royalty accruals 
we must make estimates of amounts owed related to our music publishing rights and music royalties for our domestic and international music services primarily incurred by rhapsody which was separated from our operating results beginning april  unsettled obligations incurred prior to april  remain our liability 
material differences may impact the amount and timing of our expense for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under copyright law  we may be required to pay licensing fees for digital sound recordings and compositions we deliver 
copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to the current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
our estimates are based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
estimating recoverability of deferred costs 
we defer costs on projects for service revenue and system sales 
deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems  as defined in individual customer contracts  including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties 
we recognize such costs as a component of cost of revenue  the timing of which is dependent upon the revenue recognition policy by contract 
for revenue recognized under the completed contract method  costs are deferred until the products are delivered  or upon completion of services or  where applicable  customer acceptance 
for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method  costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation 
for revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract  costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing on the date of revenue recognition 
at each balance sheet date  we review deferred costs to ensure they are ultimately recoverable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
assessing the recoverability of deferred project costs is based on significant assumptions and estimates  including future revenue and cost of sales 
significant or sustained decreases in revenue or increases in cost of sales in future periods could result in additional impairments of deferred project costs 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of such impairments 
should the value of deferred project costs become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we make estimates of the uncollectible portion of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze the age of accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
similarly  we make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates or actual future experience was different from the judgments and estimates 
estimating losses on excess office facilities 
we made significant estimates in determining the appropriate amount of accrued loss on excess office facilities 
if we make different estimates  our loss on excess office facilities could be significantly different from that recorded  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
valuation of equity method investments 
we use the equity method of accounting for investments in circumstances where we have the ability to exert significant influence  but not control  over an investee or joint venture 
we initially record our investment based on a fair value analysis of the investment 
prior to  most of our equity method investments were purchased with cash which was determined to be fair value 
for the investment in rhapsody as of march   we used multiple valuation models that were based on assumptions of future results  including operating and cash flow projections  to calculate the fair value since we contributed both cash and non cash items in exchange for our interest 
these models were based upon estimates and assumptions relating to future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
we evaluate impairment of an investment valued under the equity method only if events and circumstances warrant 
an impairment charge would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in determining if a decline is other than temporary  we consider factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investee or joint venture  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the investee or joint venture and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  as well as amortizable intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
long lived assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets is based upon estimates and assumptions relating to our future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of our long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
significant or sustained declines in future revenue or cash flows  or adverse changes in our business climate  among other factors  and their resulting impact on the estimates and assumptions relating to the value of our long lived assets could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis in future interim periods which could result in a significant impairment 
while we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  due to their complexity and subjectivity  these estimates and assumptions could vary from period to period 
valuation of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  in our fourth quarter  or more frequently if circumstances indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values 
circumstances that may indicate a reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value include  but are not limited to poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  and loss of key personnel 
due to the ongoing difficult economic environment and the decline in revenues in our businesses  we continue to monitor whether there could be potential impairment of goodwill 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  based upon our annual test or due to changes in circumstances described above  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the reporting unit carrying amount including goodwill 
if this assessment indicates it is more likely than not  we then compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  we then calculate the implied estimated fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to implied estimated value 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the reporting units and assessing the fair value of the reporting units 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model or other appropriate valuation models and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the valuation models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility in our common stock price and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation models change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from the amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
accounting for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine current provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
each reporting period we must periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future sources of taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations and comprehensive income 
in certain instances  changes in the valuation allowance may be allocated directly to the related components of shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
factors we consider in making such an assessment include  but are not limited to  past performance and our expectation of future taxable income  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our investments and other assets 
as of december   million of the million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  since such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these amounts were distributed to the us  in the form of dividends or otherwise  realnetworks could be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability or benefit on such earnings due to the timing of such future distributions  the availability of foreign tax credits  and the complexity of the computation if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for us income and foreign withholding taxes  net of foreign tax credits  may be necessary 
recently issued accounting standards there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year december  to be implemented that are of significance or potential significance to realnetworks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
all statements that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk from changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity investments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of investment grade debt securities as specified in our investment policy 
investments in both fixed and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
additionally  a declining rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate  generating less interest income 
see note  cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted cash equivalents and investments for additional information 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may be adversely impacted due to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we may incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our short term investments until maturity  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 
there have been no material changes in our investment methodology regarding our cash equivalents and short term investments during the year ended december  based on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash equivalents as of december   a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates would not increase decrease our annual interest income or cash flows by more than a nominal amount 
investment risk 
as of december   we had investments in voting capital stock of both publicly traded and privately held technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies valuation of equity method investments  and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates valuation of equity method investments in this k for details on our accounting treatment for these investments  including the analysis of other than temporary impairments 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business internationally in several currencies and thus are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part from translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation  the remeasurement of non functional currency assets  liabilities and intercompany balances into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  and non us dollar denominated sales to foreign customers 
we manage a portion of these risks through the use of financial derivatives  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
generally  our practice is to manage foreign currency risk for the majority of material short term intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
these contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contract s inception 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the short term intercompany balances  these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not designate our foreign exchange forward contracts related to short term intercompany accounts as hedges and  accordingly  we adjust these instruments to fair value through results of operations 
however  we may periodically hedge a portion of our foreign exchange exposures associated with material firmly committed transactions  long term investments  highly predictable anticipated exposures and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
some of our unhedged exposures are recorded in our statement of operations on a mark to market basis each quarter  so to the extent we continue to experience adverse economic conditions  we may record losses related to such unhedged exposures in future periods that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our foreign currency risk management program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we have cash balances denominated in foreign currencies which are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
the majority of our foreign currency denominated cash is held in korean won and euros 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the korean won and euro relative to the us dollar as of december  would not result in more than a nominal amount of unrealized gain or loss
