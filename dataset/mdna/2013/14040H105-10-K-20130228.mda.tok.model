supervision and regulation general capital one financial corporation is a bank holding company bhc under section of the bank holding company act of  as amended usc the bhc act and is subject to the requirements of the bhc act  including its capital adequacy standards and limitations on our nonbanking activities 
we are also subject to supervision  examination and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
permissible activities for a bhc include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto  such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the federal reserve by regulation or order 
certain servicing activities are also permissible for a bhc if conducted for or on behalf of the bhc or any of its affiliates 
impermissible activities for bhcs include activities that are related to commerce such as retail sales of nonfinancial products 
under federal reserve policy  we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any banks that we control  including the banks  and to commit resources to support them 
on may   we became a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley act amendments to the bhc act the glba 
the glba removed many of the restrictions on the activities of bhcs that become financial holding companies 
a financial holding company  and the nonbank companies under its control  are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature including  for example  insurance underwriting  agency sales and brokerage  securities underwriting and dealing and merchant banking activities  incidental to financial activities or complementary to financial activities if the federal reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general 
our election to become a financial holding company under the glba certifies that the depository institutions we control meet certain criteria  including capital  management and community reinvestment act cra requirements 
effective july   under amendments to the bhc act enacted under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  capital one financial corporation also must be well capitalized and well managed 
if we were to fail to continue to meet the criteria for financial holding company status  we could  depending on which requirements we failed to meet  face restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions or be required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies 
the banks are national associations chartered under the laws of the united states  the deposits of which are insured by the deposit insurance fund the dif of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic up to applicable limits 
in addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of cobna s international operations discussed below  the banks are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the occ  the fdic and  effective july   by the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb 

table of contents we are also registered as a financial institution holding company under virginia law and  as such  we are subject to periodic examination by virginia s bureau of financial institutions 
we also face regulation in the international jurisdictions in which we conduct business see below under regulation of international business by non us authorities 
regulation of business activities the activities of the banks as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act the fcra  the cra and the servicemembers civil relief act  as well as under various state laws 
depending on the underlying issue and applicable law  regulators are often authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and  in certain cases  to order banks to compensate injured borrowers 
borrowers may also have a private right of action for certain violations 
federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of a bank to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers 
these laws may affect the ability of banks to collect outstanding balances 
regulations of consumer lending activities the credit card act amending the truth in lending act enacted in may  and related changes to regulation z  impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and update the disclosures required for open end credit 
overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent  and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained 
the amount of any penalty fee or charge must be reasonable and proportional to the violation 
the credit card act also significantly restricts the ability of a card issuer to increase rates charged on pre existing card balances 
card issuers are generally prohibited from raising rates on pre existing balances when generally prevailing interest rates change 
moreover  the circumstances under which a card issuer can raise the interest rate on pre existing balances of a customer whose risk of default increases are restricted 
payments above the minimum payment must be allocated first to balances with the highest interest rate 
the amount of fees charged to credit card accounts with lower credit lines is limited 
a consumer s ability to pay must be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits 
state consumer financial laws the dodd frank act created the cfpb  a new independent supervisory body  that is the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes 
state attorneys general will be authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the cfpb 
state consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the national bank act under the existing standard set forth in the supreme court decision in barnett bank of marion county  na v 
nelson  which preempts any state law that significantly interferes with or impairs banking powers 
occ determinations of such preemption  however  must be on a case by case basis  and courts reviewing the occ s preemption determinations will now consider the appropriateness of those determinations under a different standard of judicial review 
these laws may affect the ability of the banks to collect outstanding balances 
mortgage lending the dodd frank act prescribes additional disclosure requirements and substantive limitations on our mortgage lending activities 
most of these provisions require the issuance of regulations by the cfpb or other federal agencies before they become effective 
though we do not expect the resulting regulations to have a material impact on our operations  one new requirement under the dodd frank act  the requirement for mortgage loan securitizers to retain a portion of the economic risk associated with certain mortgage loans  could impact the type and amount of mortgage loans we offer  depending on the final regulations 
debit interchange fees the dodd frank act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the 
table of contents transaction 
in june  the federal reserve adopted a final rule and an interim final rule which largely was adopted in final form in july implementing the portion of the dodd frank act that limits interchange fees received by a debit card issuer 
the final rules limit interchange fees per debit card transaction to 
plus five basis points of the transaction amount and provide for an additional 
fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements 
dividends  stock repurchases and transfers of funds in november  the federal reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us commonly referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar 
under the rules  bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more must submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the federal reserve before making most capital distributions 
the purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust  forward looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress 
as part of its evaluation of a capital plan  the federal reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan  the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy and the ability of the bank holding company to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier common ratio of on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters 
traditionally  dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our stock  make payments on corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations 
there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans 
these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements  federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus  sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates  as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
in general  federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit  without first obtaining regulatory approval  insured depository institutions  such as the banks  from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards 
capital adequacy the banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by federal banking regulators 
for a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines  see md a capital management and note regulatory and capital adequacy 
the banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirements under these guidelines as of december  fdicia and prompt corrective action in general  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia subjects banks to significantly increased regulation and supervision 
among other things  fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia establishes five capital ratio levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under applicable regulations  a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and is not subject to any supervisory agreement  order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
a bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it maintains a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least for certain highly rated institutions  and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition 
the three undercapitalized categories are based upon the 
table of contents amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to adequately capitalized institutions 
the capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying fdicia s prompt corrective action provisions  and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects 
as of december   each of the banks met the requirements for a well capitalized institution 
as summarized below  the federal reserve  occ and fdic released a proposed rule in june that would update the prompt corrective action framework to reflect new  higher regulatory capital minimums 
for a further discussion of the basel iii proposed rule  see basel iii and us capital rules proposals below 
as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions  fdicia requires regulators to establish certain non capital safety and soundness standards 
the standards relate generally to operations and management  asset quality  interest rate exposure and executive compensation 
the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 
enhanced prudential standards and other requirements under the dodd frank act with the enactment of the dodd frank act  because we are a bank holding company with consolidated assets of billion or greater a covered company  we are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards  including requirements that may be recommended by the financial stability oversight council the council and implemented by the federal reserve and other regulators 
as a result  we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions  including risk based capital requirements  leverage limits and liquidity requirements 
the council also may issue recommendations to the federal reserve or other primary financial regulatory agency to apply new or heightened standards to risky financial activities or practices 
in december  the federal reserve released proposed rules beginning to implement the enhanced prudential standards 
if finalized as proposed  we will be subject to new requirements regarding liquidity management  risk management  and single counterparty credit limits 
the proposal also implements an early remediation framework  under which a covered company could be subject to enforcement actions  growth limits  prohibitions on capital distributions and other consequences if a triggering event were to occur 
the federal reserve also indicates in the proposal that it intends to implement the basel iii capital surcharge framework  although the extent to which that would apply to us is unclear 
in october  the federal reserve released a final rule that implements the requirement in the dodd frank act that the federal reserve conduct annual stress tests on the capacity of our capital to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions 
the rule also implements the requirement that we conduct our own semiannual stress tests 
the rule also requires us to publish the results of the stress tests on our web site or other public forum 
the occ finalized a similar stress test rule in october  to implement the requirement that each of the banks conduct annual stress tests 
in addition  in  the federal reserve finalized rules requiring us to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of us 
the fdic has issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the banks 
in addition to the provisions described throughout this supervision and regulation section  the dodd frank act imposes new  more stringent standards and requirements with respect to bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers  affiliate transactions  and proprietary trading the volcker rule 
in  the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the sec jointly issued final rules further defining the dodd frank act s swap dealer definitions 
based on the final rules  no capital one entity will be required to register with the cftc or sec as a swap dealer  however  this may change in the future 
if such registration occurs  the registered entity is currently required to comply with additional regulatory requirements relating to its derivatives activities 
the dodd frank act also requires all swap market participants to keep swap transaction data records and report certain information to swap data repositories on a real time and on going basis 
further  each swap  group  category  type or class of swap that the cftc or sec determines must be cleared will need to be cleared through a derivatives clearinghouse unless the swap is eligible for a clearing exemption and executed on a designated contract market dcm  exchange or swap execution facility sef unless no dcm  exchange or sef has made the swap available for trading 
the dodd frank act also prohibits conflicts of interest relating to 
table of contents securitizations and generally requires securitizers to retain a economic interest in the credit risk of assets sold through the issuance of asset backed securitizations  with an exemption for traditionally underwritten residential mortgage loans that meet the definition of a qualified residential mortgage loan 
in addition  the dodd frank act includes provisions related to corporate governance and executive compensation and new fees and assessments  among others 
the federal agencies have significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations of the dodd frank act 
these rules may result in modifications to our business models and organizational structure  and may subject us to escalating costs associated with any such changes 
however  the full impact of the dodd frank act will not be known for many months or  in some cases  years 
in addition  the dodd frank act requires various studies and reports to be delivered to congress  which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
basel ii us federal banking regulators finalized the advanced version of basel ii in december these advanced approaches rules are mandatory for those institutions with consolidated total assets of billion or more or consolidated total on balance sheet foreign exposure of billion or more 
we became subject to these rules at the end of primarily as a result of the ing direct acquisition 
prior to full implementation of the basel ii framework  organizations must complete a qualification period of four consecutive quarters  known as the parallel run  during which they must meet the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of their primary us banking regulator 
we currently expect to enter parallel run on january  this will require completing a written implementation plan and building processes and systems to comply with the rules 
compliance with the basel ii rules will require a material investment of resources 
the collins amendment within the dodd frank act and the us banking regulators implementing final rules establish a capital floor so that organizations subject to the basel ii advanced approaches rules may not hold less capital than would be required using the generally applicable risk based and leverage capital calculations 
our current analysis suggests that our risk weighted assets will increase under the basel ii framework  and therefore we would need to hold more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio 
we will continue to monitor regulators implementation of the new rules with respect to the institutions that are subject to them and assess the potential impact to us 
basel iii and us capital rules proposals in december  the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee released proposals for additional capital and liquidity requirements  which have been clarified and amended in recent pronouncements basel iii 
in september  the basel committee announced a package of reforms that included detailed capital ratios and capital conservation buffers  subject to transition periods through in december  the basel committee published a final framework on capital and liquidity  consistent in large part with the prior proposals 
in november  the basel committee adopted a framework that would require additional tier common capital for systemically important institutions 
this surcharge would vary based on the firm s systemic importance as determined using five criteria size  interconnectedness  lack of substitutability  cross jurisdictional activity and complexity 
as described above  the us federal banking agencies have stated that they intend to implement this surcharge  although the extent to which it would apply to us is unclear 
the federal reserve  occ and fdic released in june three proposed rules that would substantially revise the federal banking agencies current capital rules  including the current basel ii advanced approaches  and implement the basel iii capital framework described above 
the first proposal  known as the basel iii proposal  would increase the general risk based capital ratio minimum requirements  modify the definition of regulatory capital  establish a minimum tier common ratio requirement  introduce a new capital conservation buffer requirement  and update the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums 

table of contents for those institutions subject to the basel ii advanced approaches framework discussed above  the proposal would also implement a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a broader set of exposures in the denominator and would introduce a new countercyclical capital buffer requirement 
the second proposal  known as the standardized approach proposal  would revise the federal banking agencies general approach for calculating risk weighted assets to reflect a more risk sensitive risk weighting approach and remove reliance on external credit ratings  as required by section a of the dodd frank act 
the third proposal would modify the existing basel ii rules for calculating risk weighted assets by implementing elements of the basel iii framework and removing reliance on external credit ratings 
as discussed above  under the collins amendment within the dodd frank act  organizations subject to the basel ii rules must calculate their risk based capital under both the standardized approach and the advanced approach and use the lower of each of the relevant capital ratios to determine whether it meets the minimum risk based capital requirements 
the proposed rules would go into effect according to different start dates and phase in periods 
if finalized as proposed  the rules would increase the minimum capital that we and other institutions would be required to hold 
in december  the basel committee also published a liquidity framework  which was subsequently amended in january the liquidity framework includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision  each subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements 
one standard promotes short term resilience by requiring sufficient high quality liquid assets to survive a stress scenario lasting for days 
this standard  the liquidity coverage ratio lcr  is included in the amended liquidity framework 
the other standard promotes longer term resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a one year period  based on the liquidity characteristics of assets and activities 
this standard remains under development by the basel committee 
we expect that minimum liquidity requirements for us and other institutions will increase as a result of the basel iii liquidity framework  though rules implementing the basel iii liquidity framework have not yet been proposed by the us federal banking agencies 
we will continue to monitor regulators implementation of the new capital and liquidity rules and assess the potential impact to us 
market risk capital rule a market risk capital rule  which the federal banking regulators amended in august  supplements both the general risk based capital rules and the basel ii advanced approaches rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading activities 
the rule applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of i percent or more of total assets or ii billion or more 
we are not yet subject to this rule but may become subject to it in the future 
deposits and deposit insurance each of cona and cobna  as an insured depository institution  is a member of the dif maintained by the fdic 
through the dif  the fdic insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the dif was formed on march   upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act 
the reform act permits the fdic to set a designated reserve ratio drr for the dif 
to maintain the dif  member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium  and the fdic may take action to increase insurance premiums if the drr falls below its required level 
prior to passage of the dodd frank act  the fdic had established a plan to restore the dif in the face of recent insurance losses and future loss projections  which resulted in several rules that generally increased deposit insurance rates and purported to improve risk differentiation so that riskier institutions bear a greater share of insurance premiums 
the dodd frank act reformed the management of the dif in several ways raised the minimum drr to from the former minimum of and removed the upper limit on the drr  
table of contents required that the reserve ratio reach by september  rather than by the end of  required that in setting assessments  the fdic must offset the effect of meeting the increased reserve ratio on small insured depository institutions  and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends from the dif when the reserve ratio reaches certain levels 
the fdic has set the drr at and  in lieu of dividends  has established progressively lower assessment rate schedules as the reserve ratio meets certain trigger levels 
the dodd frank act also required the fdic to change the deposit insurance assessment base from deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
in february  the fdic finalized rules to implement this change that significantly modified how deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for those banks with assets of billion or greater 
banks may accept brokered deposits as part of their funding 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  as discussed in md a liquidity risk  only well capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits 
adequately capitalized institutions  however  must first obtain a waiver from the fdic before accepting brokered deposits  and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institution s normal market area or  for deposits from outside the institution s normal market area  the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a bank s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the bank s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and its earnings 
overdraft protection the federal reserve amended regulation e in november to limit the ability to assess overdraft fees for paying atm and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account  unless the consumer opts in to such payment of overdrafts 
the rule does not apply to overdraft services with respect to checks  ach transactions  or recurring debit card transactions  or to the payment of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit or a service that transfers funds from another account 
we are required to provide to customers written notice describing our overdraft service  fees imposed and other information  and to provide customers with a reasonable opportunity to opt in to the service 
before we may assess fees for paying discretionary overdrafts  a customer must affirmatively opt in  which could negatively impact our deposit business revenue 
source of strength and liability for commonly controlled institutions under the regulations issued by the federal reserve  a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks the so called source of strength doctrine 
the dodd frank act codified the source of strength doctrine  directing the federal reserve to require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks 
under the cross guarantee provision of the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea  insured depository institutions such as the banks may be liable to the fdic with respect to any loss incurred  or reasonably anticipated to be incurred  by the fdic in connection with the default of  or fdic assistance to  any commonly controlled insured depository institution 
the banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the firrea cross guarantee provision 
fdic orderly liquidation authority the dodd frank act provides the fdic with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate non bank financial companies  including capital one financial corporation and its non bank subsidiaries  if the treasury 
table of contents secretary  in consultation with the president and based on the recommendation of the federal reserve and another federal agency  determines that doing so is necessary  among other criteria  to mitigate serious adverse effects on us financial stability 
upon such a determination  the fdic would be appointed receiver and must liquidate the company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard 
the costs of a liquidation of a financial company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then  if necessary  by risk based assessments on large financial companies 
the fdic has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority and may issue additional rules in the future 
ffiec account management guidance on january   the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec released account management and loss allowance guidance the guidance 
the guidance applies to all credit lending of regulated financial institutions and generally requires that banks properly manage several elements of their lending programs  including line assignments  over limit practices  minimum payment and negative amortization  workout and settlement programs  and the accounting methodology used for various assets and income items related to loans 
we believe that our account management and loss allowance practices are prudent and appropriate and  consistent with the guidance 
we caution  however  the guidance provides wide discretion to bank regulatory agencies in the application of the guidance to any particular institution and its account management and loss allowance practices 
accordingly  under the guidance  bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future  and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
fair credit reporting like other financial institutions  the banks rely upon consumer reports for prescreen marketing  underwriting new loans and for reviewing and managing risks associated with existing accounts 
in addition  the banks furnish customer account information to the major consumer reporting agencies 
the use of consumer reports by the banks and furnishing of account information to the consumer reporting agencies is regulated under the fcra on a uniform  nationwide basis 
this includes restrictions on the ability of the banks to share consumer report information with affiliates and to use customer account information shared by affiliates for a marketing purpose 
the fair and accurate credit transactions act of the fact act  extends the federal preemption of the fcra permanently  although the law authorizes states to enact laws regulating certain subject matters so long as they are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the fcra 
the fact act also added new provisions to the fcra designed to address the growing crime of identity theft and to improve the accuracy of consumer credit information 
generally  fcra rulemaking and enforcement authority with respect to the banks now resides with cfpb 
in addition  the fcra creates a limited private right of action for consumers to seek relief for certain violations of the fcra 
investment in the company and the banks certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law 
investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not  directly or indirectly  acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval 
each of the banks is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the change in bank control act 
consequently  federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without  in most cases  prior written approval of the federal reserve or the occ  as applicable 
control is conclusively presumed if  among other things  a person or company acquires more than of any class of our voting stock 
a rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires more than of any class of voting stock and is subject to any of a number of specified control factors as set forth in the applicable regulations 

table of contents additionally  cobna and cona are banks within the meaning of chapter of title of the code of virginia governing the acquisition of interests in virginia financial institutions the financial institution holding company act 
the financial institution holding company act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring  or making any public offer to acquire  control of a virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to  and receiving prior approval from  the virginia bureau of financial institutions

cross border interchange fees continue to be under scrutiny from the european commission the ec and the oft 
in may  the ec held that mastercard s interchange fees were anticompetitive  and its decisions were upheld by the general court 
the general court held that there was no merchant or consumer benefit that could justify the restriction on competition implied by the fee 
mastercard has appealed this decision  although it is not expected that the appeal will be concluded before the oft has indicated its own investigation will remain on hold until after the outcome of mastercard s appeal 
in august  visa europe was warned by the ec that its multilateral interchange fees may also violate the eu s competition rules

these regulations came into force on august  in september  the credit business practices banks  authorized foreign banks  trust and loan companies  retail associations  canadian insurance companies and foreign insurance companies regulations were amended to require a bank to obtain express consent prior to providing credit card checks to a borrower 
if consent is given orally  the bank must provide confirmation of that consent in writing paper or electronic 
the amended regulations also provide that the use of the credit card or the use of the check does not constitute express consent 
these amendments will come into force on june  competition each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive environment  and we face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non bank providers of financial services 
our credit card business competes with international  national  regional and local issuers of visa and mastercard credit cards  as well as with american express  discover card  private label card brands  and  to a certain extent  issuers of debit cards 
in general  customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price  credit limit and other product features 
our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses compete with national and state banks and direct banks for deposits  auto loans  mortgages and trust accounts and with savings and loan associations and credit 
table of contents unions for loans and deposits 
our competitors also include automotive finance companies  mortgage banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans  deposits  and other similar services and products 
in addition  we compete against non depository institutions that are able to offer these products and services 
securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions 
combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business 
the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 
in addition  competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 
our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services  transaction execution  innovation and price 
competition varies based on the types of clients  customers  industries and geographies served 
our ability to compete depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain our professional and other associates and on our reputation 
in the current environment  customers are generally attracted to depository institutions that are perceived as stable  with solid liquidity and funding 
we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our current markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop  or by the broader economic environment 
for a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment  please refer to item a 
risk factors 
employees a central part of our philosophy is to attract and retain a highly capable staff 
we had  employees  whom we refer to as associates  as of december  none of our associates are covered under a collective bargaining agreement  and management considers our associate relations to be satisfactory 
additional information geographic diversity our consumer loan portfolios  including credit cards  are diversified across the united states with modest concentration in california  texas  new york  florida  louisiana and illinois 
we also have credit card loans in the uk and canada 
our commercial loans are concentrated in new york  texas  louisiana and new jersey 
see md a credit risk profile and note loans for additional information 
technology systems we leverage information technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers needs 
a key part of our strategic focus is the development of efficient  flexible computer and operational systems to support complex marketing and account management strategies  the servicing of our customers  and the development of new and diversified products 
we believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs  improve quality and provide faster  more flexible technology services 
consequently  we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems  processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements 
as part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies  we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality  lower cost  or both 
over time  we have increasingly relied on third party outsourcers to help us 
table of contents deliver systems and operational infrastructure 
these relationships include but are not limited to total system services inc tsys for processing services for our north american and united kingdom portfolios of consumer and small business credit card accounts  fidelity information services fis for the capital one banking systems and ibm corporation for management of our north american data centers 
to protect our systems and technologies  we employ security  backup and recovery systems and generally require the same of our third party service providers 
in addition  we perform  or cause to be performed  a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms  systems and applications used to provide our products and services in an effort to ensure that any attacks on these platforms  systems and applications are unlikely to succeed 
despite these controls  capital one  along with several other us financial services providers  was targeted recently on several occasions with distributed denial of service attacks from sophisticated third parties that succeeded  on a few occasions  in temporarily limiting our ability to service customers through online platforms 
intellectual property as part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property  we rely on a variety of protections  including copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and certain restrictions on disclosure  solicitation  and competition 
we also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization 
our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information 
in addition  our competitors and other third parties also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry 
the ability of our competitors and other third parties to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete 
conversely  our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts  or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results

table of contents competition from providers of products and services that compete with our businesses  and other risk factors listed from time to time in reports that we file with the sec 
any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made or as of the date indicated  and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you should carefully consider the factors discussed above in evaluating these forward looking statements 
for additional information on factors that could materially influence forward looking statements included in this report  see the risk factors set forth under part i item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
item a 
risk factors business risks this section highlights specific risks that could affect our business 
although we have tried to discuss all material risks of which we are aware at the time this annual report on form k has been filed  other risks may prove to be important in the future  including those that are not currently ascertainable 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report  other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements include the current business environment  including a slow or delayed economic recovery  may adversely affect our industry  business  results of operations and capital levels 
the recent global recession resulted in a general tightening in the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  reduced asset values including commercial properties  sharp and prolonged declines in residential home values and sales volumes  reduced business profits  increased rates of business and consumer repayment delinquency  increased rates of business and consumer bankruptcy  and increased and prolonged unemployment  some of which have had a negative impact on our results of operation 
although the overall economic recovery seems to be underway  it has remained modest and fragile 
a recovery that is only shallow and very gradual  marked by continued elevated unemployment rates and reduced home prices  or another downturn  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans or maintain lower deposit levels or  in the case of credit card accounts  carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events adverse macroeconomic conditions may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  changes in consumer behavior  including decreased consumer spending and a shift in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fees  over limit fees  finance charges and other fees  could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
increases in bankruptcies could cause increases in our charge off rates  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our ability to recover debt that we have previously charged off may be limited  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the processes and models we use to estimate inherent losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments  including assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation in an unpredictable economic environment  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

table of contents our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses  which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
significant concern regarding the creditworthiness of some of the governments in europe and uncertainty stemming from us debt and budget matters have contributed to volatility in the financial markets and led to greater economic uncertainty worldwide 
concerns about sovereign debt in europe and the us debt could diminish economic recovery and lead to further stress in the financial markets  both globally and in the united states  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations  which could limit our access to funding 
the interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by  among other things  applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies 
a downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets  increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
increased charge offs  rising libor and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled  which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources 
we have increased our reliance on deposit funding over the past several years  in particular with the acquisition of ing direct  and an inability to accept or maintain deposits or to obtain other sources of funding could materially affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business 
many other financial institutions have also increased their reliance on deposit funding and  as such  we expect continued competition in the deposit markets 
we cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs 
if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits  our funding costs will be adversely impacted 
interest rates have remained at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time  and the flat yield curve associated with current interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it limits our opportunity to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs 
the continued presence of a flat yield curve for a sustained period of time could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our net interest margin 
the historically low interest rate environment also increases our exposure to prepayment risk  particularly with respect to the originated mortgage portfolio we acquired from ing direct 
increased prepayments  refinancing or other factors would reduce expected revenue associated with mortgage assets and could also lead to a reduction in the value of our mortgage servicing rights  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
compliance with new and existing laws  regulations and regulatory expectations may increase our costs  reduce our revenue  limit our ability to pursue business opportunities  and increase compliance challenges 
there has been increased legislation and regulation with respect to the financial services industry in the last few years  and we expect that oversight of our business will continue to expand in scope and complexity 
a wide and increasing array of banking and consumer lending laws apply to almost every aspect of our business 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial  structural and operational penalties  including receivership  and could result in negative publicity or damage to our reputation with regulators or the public 
in addition  establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
the dodd frank act  as well as the related rules and regulations adopted by various regulatory agencies  could have a significant adverse impact on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the dodd frank act is a comprehensive financial reform act that requires  among other things  enhanced prudential standards 
table of contents including capital and liquidity requirements  enhanced supervision including stress testing  recovery and resolution planning often referred to as living wills  prohibitions on proprietary trading and increased transparency and regulation of derivatives trading 
the dodd frank act also provides heightened expectations for risk management and regulatory oversight of all aspects of large financial institutions  including us 
many aspects of the law remain to be implemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the sec  the cftc and federal banking regulators 
although it is clear that the dodd frank act and implementing regulations materially impact large financial institutions like us  the rulemaking process has been progressing slowly  and we may not experience the ultimate impact of the dodd frank act for years 
though some aspects of the dodd frank act may significantly impact our financial condition or results of operations  other aspects of the law may not apply to us 
nevertheless  the law has increased our need to build new compliance processes and infrastructure and to otherwise enhance our risk management throughout all aspects of our business 
the cumulative impact includes higher expectations for capital and liquidity  as discussed in more detail below under the header we may not be able to maintain adequate capital levels or liquidity  which could have a negative impact on our financial results  and higher operational costs  which may further increase once regulators fully implement the law 
in addition  us government agencies charged with adopting rules and regulations under the dodd frank act may do so in an unforeseen manner  including ways that potentially expand the reach of the legislation more than was initially contemplated 
there are a number of other provisions in the dodd frank act that directly or through implementing regulations may impact our business  including the dodd frank act will likely subject us to the supervision of regulatory agencies that historically have not regulated our businesses  such as the commodity futures trading commission with respect to our derivatives activities 
the dodd frank act also created the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb  who regulates our businesses with respect to our compliance with certain consumer laws and regulations 
the cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
the dodd frank act requires the federal reserve to establish enhanced prudential standards governing capital  liquidity  risk management  stress testing  single counterparty credit exposure limits  early remediation  and resolution planning for bank holding companies and certain foreign banking organizations with billion or more in consolidated total assets covered companies 
in december  the federal reserve requested comment on proposed rules that would implement most of these requirements for domestic covered companies  including us 
the federal reserve and the fdic issued a final rule in november implementing the resolution planning requirements  and under the rule  we are required to submit our resolution plan by december  the cost of complying with final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards could have a negative impact on our financial results 
the credit card act amending the truth in lending act and related changes to regulation z impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and also update the disclosures required for open end credit 
overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent of the customer  and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained 
the amount of any penalty fee or charge must be reasonable and proportional to the violation 
in addition  the ability of a card issuer to increase rates charged on pre existing card balances has been significantly restricted 
card issuers are generally prohibited from raising rates on pre existing balances when generally prevailing interest rates change 
moreover  the circumstances under which a card issuer can raise the interest rate on pre existing balances of a customer whose risk of default increases are restricted 
as a result  the rules implementing the credit card act could make the card business generally less resilient in future economic downturns 
under the various state and federal statutes and regulations  we are required to observe various data security and privacy related requirements  including establishing information security and data security breach response programs and properly authenticating customers before processing or enabling certain types of transactions or interactions 
future federal and state legislation and regulation could further restrict how we collect  use  share 
table of contents and secure customer information 
the failure to observe any one or more of these requirements could subject us to litigation or enforcement actions and impact some of our current or planned business initiatives 
in  we were party to several consent orders and settlement agreements with certain federal agencies 
on july   cobna entered into consent orders with each of the occ and the cfpb relating to oversight of our vendor sales practices of payment protection and credit monitoring products 
on july   the banks each entered into consent orders with each of the department of justice and the occ relating to compliance with the servicemembers civil relief act  or the scra  and  in the case of the occ orders  third party management 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we closed the ing direct acquisition 
in its order approving the acquisition  the federal reserve board required capital one to enhance our risk management systems and policies enterprise wide to account for the changes to our business lines that would result from the acquisitions of ing direct and hsbc s credit card operations in the us among other things  we are implementing enhancements to our compliance risk management programs on an enterprise wide basis in the following primary areas compliance with laws  rules and regulations regarding unfair and deceptive practices  compliance with the scra  compliance monitoring and transaction testing capabilities to detect any instances of non compliance with consumer compliance laws and regulations  third party management  especially in the context of compliance with consumer laws and regulations  and internal controls  policies and procedures and oversight by the board and senior management 
we are continuing to make significant changes to our systems and processes in order to enhance our enterprise wide compliance risk management programs 
there will continue to be heightened regulatory oversight by the federal banking regulators to ensure that we build systems and processes that are commensurate with the nature of our business  and we expect this heightened oversight will continue for the foreseeable future until we meet the expectations of our regulators and can demonstrate that such systems and processes are sustainable 
the legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control  may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue  costs  earnings  growth and capital levels 
certain laws and regulations  and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto  may benefit consumers  borrowers and depositors  but not stockholders 
our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations 
for a description of the laws and regulations to which we are subject  please refer to supervision and regulation in item business 
we may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses 
like other lenders  we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans 
rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses such as higher delinquencies  higher rates of non performing loans  higher bankruptcy rates  lower collateral values or elevated unemployment rates may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses  which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses 
in particular  we face the following risks in this area missed payments 
our customers may miss payments 
loan charge offs including from bankruptcies are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition for our customers 
customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth 
in addition  we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change for example  an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt  causing a long term rise in delinquencies and charge offs 

table of contents estimates of inherent losses 
the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings 
we allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios 
this process  which is critical to our financial results and condition  requires complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions 
we may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold a loan loss allowance sufficient to account for these losses 
incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimates of inherent losses and inadequate allowance for loan and lease losses 
in addition  our estimate of inherent losses impacts the amount of allowances we build to account for those losses 
in cases where we modify a loan  if the modifications do not perform as anticipated we may be required to build additional allowance on these loans 
the increase or release of allowances impacts our current financial results 
underwriting 
our ability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers may diminish 
if the models and approaches we use to select  manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge offs due  for example  to rapid changes in the economy  including the unemployment rate  our credit losses may increase and our returns may deteriorate 
business mix 
our business mix could change in ways that could adversely affect credit losses 
we engage in a diverse mix of businesses with a broad range of credit loss characteristics 
consequently  changes in our business mix may change our charge off rate 
charge off recognition 
the rules governing charge off recognition could change 
we record charge offs according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules 
these guidelines and rules  including fasb standards and the ffiec account management guidance  could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices and cause our charge offs and or allowance for loan and lease losses to increase for reasons unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio 
such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
industry developments 
our charge off and delinquency rates may be negatively impacted by industry developments  including new regulations applicable to our industry 
collateral 
collateral  when we have it  could be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses 
when customers default on their loans and we have collateral  we attempt to seize it where permissible and appropriate 
however  the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan  and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers 
particularly with respect to our commercial lending and home loan activities  decreases in real estate values adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans and investments 
thus  the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans 
borrowers may be less likely to continue making payments on loans if the value of the property used as collateral for the loan is less than what the borrower owes  even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payments 
new york concentration 
although our lending is geographically diversified  approximately of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
the regional economic conditions in the new york area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
an economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in  or a catastrophic event that disproportionately affects  the new york region could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations 
we may experience increased losses associated with mortgage repurchases and indemnification obligations 
certain of our subsidiaries  including greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint  capital one home loans and capital one  na  as successor to chevy chase bank  may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that have been sold to investors in the event there are breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements 
we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we sell to investors in the event that there 
table of contents was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated 
these subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances  including securities fraud or other public disclosure related claims  and the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans 
consequently  we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans 
we have established reserves in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by our originating subsidiaries 
the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on  among other things  the actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests  the actual success rate of claimants  developments in litigation related to us and the industry  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
due to uncertainties relating to these factors  there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
for additional information related to our mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification obligations and related reserves and our estimate of the reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels as of december   see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees 
we may not be able to maintain adequate capital levels or liquidity  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
as a result of the dodd frank act and international accords  financial institutions will become subject to new and increased capital and liquidity requirements 
although us regulators have proposed regulations for some of these requirements  there remains uncertainty as to the form the new requirements will take or how and when they will apply to us 
as a result  it is possible that we could be required to increase our capital levels above the levels in our current financial plans 
these new requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend  grow deposit balances or make acquisitions and on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases 
higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity 
recent developments in capital and liquidity requirements that may impact us include the following in december  the basel committee on banking supervision published a final framework on capital and in january published a revised framework on liquidity  together commonly known as basel iii 
the key elements of the capital proposal include raising the quality  consistency and transparency of the capital base  strengthening the risk coverage of the capital framework  introducing a leverage ratio that is different from the us leverage ratio measures  promoting the build up of capital buffers  and imposing a capital surcharge for global systemically important institutions 
the liquidity framework includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision  one standard promoting short term resilience included in the liquidity framework  and the other promoting longer term resilience still under development by the basel committee 
in june  us banking regulators published proposed regulations that  among other things  implement the basel capital requirements  update the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the higher basel capital minimums  and revise the federal banking agencies general approach for calculating risk weighted assets 
these rules have not yet been finalized 
proposed us rules implementing the basel iii liquidity framework are expected at a later date 
because we are a consolidated bank holding company with consolidated assets of billion or greater  we are subject to certain heightened prudential standards under the dodd frank act  including requirements that may be recommended by the financial stability oversight council and implemented by the federal reserve 
as a result  we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions  including risk based capital requirements  leverage limits and liquidity requirements 
in december  the federal reserve released proposed rules beginning to implement the enhanced prudential requirements  including a detailed liquidity framework 
if finalized as proposed  these 
table of contents requirements would increase our liquidity requirements and associated compliance and operational costs 
the federal reserve also indicated that it plans to adopt a capital surcharge for certain larger institutions  but it is not clear to what extent the capital surcharge would apply to us 
in november  the federal reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us commonly referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar 
under the rules  bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more must submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the federal reserve before making most capital distributions 
the purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust  forward looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress 
as part of its evaluation of a capital plan  the federal reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan  the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy and the ability of the bank holding company to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier common ratio of on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters 
the basel ii final rules as implemented in the united states are mandatory for those institutions with consolidated total assets of billion or more or consolidated total on balance sheet foreign exposure of billion or more 
we became subject to these rules at the end of primarily as a result of the acquisition of ing direct 
prior to full implementation of the basel ii framework  organizations must complete a qualification period of four consecutive quarters  known as the parallel run  during which they must meet the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of their primary us banking regulator 
we are preparing to enter parallel run january  this will require completing a written implementation plan and building processes and systems to comply with the rules 
compliance with the basel ii rules will require a material investment of resources 
in addition  although we have current estimates of risk weight calculations  there remains uncertainty around future regulatory interpretations of certain of those calculations 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our current estimates will be correct and we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital than we currently estimate in order to maintain a given capital ratio 
see item business supervision and regulation for additional information 
we face risk related to our operational  technological and organizational infrastructure 
our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire necessary operational  technological and organizational infrastructure 
we are in the process of completing significant development projects to complete the systems integration of prior acquisitions and to build a scalable infrastructure in both our retail banking and commercial banking businesses 
for example  we are investing in infrastructure in the commercial banking business intended to assist with effective execution of key analytical processes and improve loan origination and underwriting platforms 
in addition  we have made and anticipate continuing to make additional infrastructure changes and upgrades in connection with the integrations of both the ing direct and us card acquisitions 
the us card acquisition involved the transfer of intellectual property  servicing platforms  infrastructure  contact centers and a significant number of employees 
the decoupling and transitioning of these assets  infrastructure and systems from hsbc s current systems and operations and integrating them into our own business operations has been  and we expect it to continue to be  a highly complex process 
these infrastructure changes  upgrades and integrations may cause disruptions to our existing and acquired businesses  including  but not limited to  systems interruptions  transaction processing errors  interruptions to collection processes and system conversion delays  all of which could have a negative impact on us 
in addition  we have entered into numerous transitional service arrangements with hsbc entities that will provide for services associated with the decoupling and transition of the business 
under these arrangements  hsbc provides certain services to us and we provide certain services to hsbc 
these transitional service arrangements will continue for various dates until the separation of the business from hsbc is complete  
table of contents and during that time we will rely on the ability of the applicable hsbc entities to provide these services 
the complexities and requirements of these arrangements will increase the operational risk associated with the transition and integration of the business  and this increased risk could lead to unanticipated expenses  disruptions to our operations or other adverse consequences 
similar to other large corporations  we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways  such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes  inaccurate models  faulty or disabled computer systems  fraud by employees or persons outside of our company and exposure to external events 
in addition  we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to manage our internal financial and other systems  interface with our customers and develop and implement effective marketing campaigns 
we also depend on models to measure risks  estimate certain financial values and determine pricing on certain products 
our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones and to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on the functionality and reliability of our operational and technology systems 
any disruptions  failures or inaccuracies of our operational and technology systems and models  including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems and models  could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services  manage our risk or to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner  all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in some cases  we and the businesses we are acquiring outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality to third parties 
these third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control 
any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to these risks 
in addition  our on going investments in infrastructure  which may be necessary to maintain a competitive business  integrate recent acquisitions  such as ing direct and the us card acquisitions  and establish scalable operations  may increase our expenses 
further  as our business develops  changes or expands  additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies  management of outsourced services  asset purchases or other acquisitions  structural reorganization  compliance with new laws or regulations or the integration of newly acquired businesses 
if we are unable to successfully manage our expenses  our financial results will be negatively affected 
we could incur increased costs or reductions in revenue or suffer reputational damage and business disruptions in the event of the theft  loss or misuse of information  including as a result of a cyber attack 
our products and services involve the gathering  storage and transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers and their accounts 
our ability to provide such products and services  many of which are web based  relies upon the management and safeguarding of information  software  methodologies and business secrets 
to provide these products and services  we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate 
we also have arrangements in place with retail partners and other third parties where we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers 
as a financial institution  we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws  regulations and guidance  as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs 
if unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to personal  confidential or proprietary information  including customer information  in our possession or to our proprietary information  software  methodologies and business secrets  it could result in significant legal and financial exposure  supervisory liability  damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems  products and services that could adversely affect our business 
information security risks for large financial institutions like us have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies  the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to 
table of contents conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime  perpetrators of fraud  hackers  terrorists  activists  formal and informal instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties 
as noted above  our operations rely on the secure processing  transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks 
our businesses rely on our digital technologies  computer and email systems  software and networks to conduct their operations 
in addition  to access our products and services  our customers may use computers  smartphones  tablet pcs and other mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems 
although we believe we have a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls  our technologies  systems  networks and our customers devices may become the target of cyber attacks or other attacks that could result in the unauthorized release  gathering  monitoring  misuse  loss or destruction of our or our customers confidential  proprietary or other information  including their access credential to accounts with online functionality  or that could result in disruptions to the business operations of us or our customers or other third parties 
for example  capital one and other us financial services providers were targeted recently on several occasions with distributed denial of service attacks from sophisticated third parties 
on at least one occasion  these attacks successfully disrupted consumer online banking services for a period of time 
if these attacks are successful  or if customers are unable to access their accounts online for other reasons  it could adversely impact our ability to service customer accounts or loans  complete financial transactions for our customers or otherwise operate any of our businesses or services online 
in addition  a breach or attack affecting one of our third party service providers or partners could impact us through no fault of our own 
because the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack  disable  degrade or sabotage platforms  systems and applications change frequently and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have been launched  we and our third party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures 
should a cyber attack against us succeed on any material scale  market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed  and we could face the aforementioned risks 
though we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks  it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event 
the growth of our direct banking business presents certain risks 
as a result of our strategic decisions and acquisition of ing direct  we have grown our direct banking business significantly over the past few years 
today  we operate the largest online direct banking institution in the us  with approximately billion in deposits as of december  while direct banking represents a significant opportunity to attract new customers that value greater and more flexible access to banking services at reduced costs  it also presents significant risks 
in addition to the software  infrastructure and cyber attack risks discussed above  we face risks related to direct banking  including we face strong competition in the direct banking market 
aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balances and the cost efficient acquisition of new deposit funds and may affect our growth and profitability 
in addition  the effects of a competitive environment may be exacerbated by the flexibility of direct banking and the increasing financial and technological sophistication of our customer base 
we have transitioned from the ing direct brand to a new brand  capital one  which may not be readily accepted by customers  and these customers may not accept our branding  image  name  reputation  policies or level of service or may be dissatisfied with perceived differences regarding how they manage their online accounts after the transition  and as a result may transfer their accounts and business to a competitor 
customers could also close their online accounts or reduce balances or deposits in favor of products and services offered by competitors for other reasons 
these shifts  which could be rapid  could result from general dissatisfaction with our products or services  including concerns over pricing  online security or our reputation 
our direct banking business is dependent on our ability to process  record and monitor a large number of complex transactions 
if any of our financial  accounting  or other data processing systems fail or have other 
table of contents significant shortcomings  we could be materially adversely affected 
third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk  particularly in the event of breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems 
we may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  which may include  for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  cyber attacks  including distributed denial of service attacks discussed above  natural disasters  other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics  including terrorist acts 
any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate our direct banking business  service customer accounts  and protect customers information  or result in potential liability to customers  reputational damage  regulatory intervention and customers loss of confidence in our direct banking business  any of which could result in a material adverse effect 
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers and acquisitions 
we have engaged in merger and acquisition activity over the past several years and may continue to engage in such activity in the future 
for example  in  we closed the ing direct and us card acquisitions 
we continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in  among other merger and acquisition activity  additional strategic partnerships and selected acquisitions of financial institutions and other financial assets  including credit card and other loan portfolios 
any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake will entail certain risks  which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
if we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  including cost savings and other synergies  our business could be negatively affected 
in addition  it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees  errors or delays in systems implementation  the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with partners  clients  customers  depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership 
integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources 
these integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period 
in addition  we may face the following risks in connection with any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership new businesses and geographic or other markets 
our merger  acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic areas or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new businesses or markets 
these new businesses or markets may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and could react differently to economic and other external factors 
we face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets 
identification and assessment of merger and acquisition targets and deployment of acquired assets 
we cannot assure you that we will identify or acquire suitable financial assets or institutions to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions or strategic partnerships 
in addition  we may incorrectly assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we acquire 
further  our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we partner with  merge with or acquire 
we may be unable to profitably deploy any assets we acquire 
accuracy of assumptions 
in connection with any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  we may make certain assumptions relating to the proposed merger or acquisition that may be  or may prove to be  inaccurate  including as the result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership 
the inaccuracy of any assumptions we may make could result in unanticipated consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
assumptions we might make when considering a proposed merger  acquisition or strategic partnership may relate to numerous matters  including 
table of contents projections of a target or partner company s future net income and our earnings per share  our ability to issue equity and debt to complete any merger or acquisition  our expected capital structure and capital ratios after any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  projections as to the amount of future loan losses in any target or partner company s portfolio  the amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  certain purchase accounting adjustments that we expect will be recorded in our financial statements in connection with any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  cost  deposit  cross selling and balance sheet synergies in connection with any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  merger  acquisition or strategic partnership costs  including restructuring charges and transaction costs  our ability to maintain  develop and deepen relationships with customers of a target or partner company  our ability to grow a target or partner company s customer deposits and manage a target or partner company s assets and liabilities  higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following any merger or acquisition transaction  the extent and nature of regulatory oversight over a target or partner company  projected or expected tax benefits or assets  accounting matters related to the target or partner company  including accuracy of assumptions and estimates used in preparation of financial statements such as those used to determine allowance for loan losses  fair value of certain assets and liabilities  securities impairment and realization of deferred tax assets  our expectations regarding macroeconomic conditions  including the unemployment rate  housing prices  the interest rate environment  the shape of the yield curve  inflation and other economic indicators  and other financial and strategic risks associated with any merger or acquisition 
target specific risk 
assets and companies that we acquire will have their own risks that are specific to a particular asset or company 
these risks include  but are not limited to  particular or specific regulatory  accounting  operational  reputational and industry risks  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
indemnification rights  if any  may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses or damages resulting from such risks 
in addition to regulatory approvals discussed above  certain of our merger  acquisitions or partnership activity may require third party consents in order for us to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction 
reputational risk and social factors may impact our results 
our ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our business practices or our financial health 
adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer  commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them 
in particular  negative perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us 
negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances  including lending practices  
table of contents regulatory compliance  inadequate protection of customer information  or sales and marketing  and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct 
in addition  third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us 
in addition  a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity  including credit card use  payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers domestically and internationally 
these social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels  the public s perception regarding consumer debt  including credit card use  and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy 
if consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt  or if consumption trends decline  our business and financial results will be negatively affected 
damage to our brands could impact our financial performance 
our brands have historically been very important to us 
as with many financial services institutions  maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and to continue to provide high quality products and services 
negative public perception of our brands could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  corporate governance  regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information  as well as from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct 
if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands  or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our online banking brands may also be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including service outages  including as a result of a cyber attack  integration difficulties from recent acquisitions  product malfunctions  data privacy  lack of training and security issues 
we face intense competition in all of our markets 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits and the rates and other terms we charge on the loans we originate or purchase  as well as the quality of our customer service 
price competition for loans might result in origination of fewer loans or earning less on our loans 
we expect that competition will continue to increase with respect to most of our products 
some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are  which may give those competitors advantages  including a more diversified product and customer base  the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers  operational efficiencies  more versatile technology platforms  broad based local distribution capabilities  lower cost funding and larger existing branch networks 
in addition  some of our competitors  including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space  are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject  which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we have significantly expanded our partnership business over the past several years with the additions of a number of credit card partnerships from the us card acquisition and credit card partnerships with kohl s  hbc and sony 
the market for key business partners  especially in the card business  is very competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships 
we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships  even after we have invested significant resources  time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationships 
the loss of any of our business partners could have a negative impact on our results of operations  including lower returns  excess operating expense and excess funding capacity 
in such a competitive environment  we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms  or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base 
customer attrition from any or all of our lending products  together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain 
table of contents customers  could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings 
similarly  customer attrition from our deposit products  in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain those deposits  may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings 
if we do not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry  our financial performance may suffer 
our ability to deliver to stockholders strong financial performance and returns on investment will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of our customers 
with our recent ing direct and us card acquisitions  we have begun to market new products to our larger customer base 
our ability to meet our customers needs and expectations is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings 
many of our competitors are focusing on cross selling their products and developing new products or technologies  which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits 
this increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers  all of which may affect our customers expectations and demands 
if we do not successfully anticipate and adjust to changes in the financial service industry  our business and financial results will be negatively affected 
fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility in the capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense  the value of assets and obligations  our cost of capital or our liquidity 
like other financial institutions  our business may be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the capital markets 
changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us 
for example  we borrow money from other institutions and depositors  which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other earning assets 
we earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors 
fluctuations in interest rates  including changes in the relationship between short term rates and long term rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate  may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer prepayments for mortgage  auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards 
these changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio 
changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us 
in addition  changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio 
finally  such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing 
we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes 
we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments 
we face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings  especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed 
see md a market risk management for additional information 
our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate skilled senior leaders 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain key senior leaders  and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business 
the executive compensation provisions of the dodd frank act and the regulations issued thereunder  and any further legislation  regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation  may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract  retain and motivate such 
table of contents leaders in support of our long term strategy 
these laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions  and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with whom we compete for talent 
if we are unable to retain talented senior leadership  our business could be negatively affected 
our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation 
our businesses are subject to increased litigation risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources  including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry  the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry  the structure of the credit card industry and business practices in the mortgage lending business 
substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business 
for a description of the litigation risks that we face  see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees 
we face risks from unpredictable catastrophic events 
despite our substantial business contingency plans  the impact from natural disasters and other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  may have a negative effect on our business and infrastructure  including our information technology systems 
in addition  if a natural disaster or other catastrophic event occurs in certain regions where our business and customers are concentrated  such as the new york metropolitan area  we could be disproportionately impacted as compared to our competitors 
the impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks from the use of or changes to estimates in our financial statements 
pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap  we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements  including  but not limited to  estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec and other regulatory bodies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards  including those related to assumptions and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements  in ways that we cannot predict and that could impact our financial statements 
if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect or if financial accounting and reporting standards are changed  we may experience unexpected material losses 
for a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  see note summary of significant accounting policies 
our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends 
we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries 
dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries  including our bank subsidiaries  have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common stock  make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations 
there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans 
these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements  federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus  sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates  as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
if our subsidiaries earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels  our liquidity may be affected and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common stockholders  to make payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations  each and any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or perception of financial health 

table of contents the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  servicing  counterparty and other relationships 
with our recent ing direct and us card acquisitions  we have increased exposure to financial institutions and counterparties 
these counterparties include institutions and counterparties that may be exposed to various risks over which we have little or no control  including european or us sovereign debt that is currently or may become in the future subject to significant price pressure  rating agency downgrade or default risk 
in addition  we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients  resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
likewise  adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors  the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate or sovereign debt could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments 
in addition  adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us 
these perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face

table of contents item selected financial data the following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance metrics for the five year period ended december  certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap  which we refer to as our reported results 
this data should be reviewed in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and with the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a included in this report 
the historical financial information presented may not be indicative of our future performance 
the acquisitions of ing direct on february  and the us card acquisition on may  had a significant impact on our results and selected metrics for the year ended december  and our financial condition as of december  we use the term acquired loans to refer to a limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the us card acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ing direct and chevy chase bank ccb acquisitions  which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected under the accounting standard formerly known as statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  commonly referred to as sop 
the loans acquired in the us card acquisition accounted for based on expected cash flows consisted of loans with a fair value at acquisition of approximately million that were deemed to be credit impaired because they were delinquent and revolving cardholder privileges had been revoked 
the difference between the fair value and initial expected cash flows represents the accretable yield  which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans 
the difference between the contractual payments on the loans and the expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount not considered collectible  which approximates what we refer to as the credit mark 
the credit mark established under the accounting for these loans takes into consideration future expected credit losses over the life of the loans 
accordingly  there are no charge offs or an allowance associated with these loans unless the estimated cash flows expected to be collected decrease subsequent to acquisition 
in addition  these loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming even though the customer may be contractually past due because we expect that we will fully collect the carrying value of these loans 
the accounting and classification of these loans may significantly alter some of our reported credit quality metrics 
we therefore supplement certain reported credit quality metrics with metrics adjusted to exclude the impact of these acquired loans 
of the billion in outstanding receivables that we acquired in the us card acquisition that were designated as held for investment  billion had existing revolving privileges at acquisition and were therefore excluded from the acquired loan accounting guidance described above 
these loans were recorded at fair value of billion at acquisition  which resulted in a net premium of million that is being amortized against interest income over the remaining life of the loans 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a provision for credit losses of billion  which is included in our total provision for credit losses of billion for  to establish an initial allowance related to these loans

change is less than one percent or not meaningful 
effective january   we prospectively adopted two accounting standards related to the transfer and servicing of financial assets and consolidations that changed how we account for securitized loans 
the adoption of these accounting standards  which we refer o in this report as consolidation accounting standards  resulted in the consolidation of our credit card securitization trusts and certain other trusts  which added billion of assets  consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables underlying the consolidated securitization trusts  along with billion of related debt issued by these trusts to third party investors to our reported consolidated balance sheet and reduced our stockholders equity by billion and reduced our tier risk based capital ratio to from 
the reduction to stockholders equity was driven by the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses of billion pre tax primarily related to receivables held in credit card securitization trusts that were consolidated at the adoption date 
prior period reported amounts have not been restated as the accounting standards were adopted prospectively 
prior to january   in addition to our reported us gaap results  we presented and analyzed our results on a non gaap managed basis 
our managed basis presentation included certain reclassification adjustments that assumed securitized loans accounted for as sales remained on balance sheet  and the earnings from the off balance sheet securitized loans were reported in our results of operations in the same manner as earnings on retained loans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
while our managed presentation resulted in differences in the classification of revenues in our income statement  net income on a managed basis was the same as our reported net income 
we believe this managed basis information was useful to investors because it enabled them to understand both the credit risks associated with loans reported on our consolidated balance sheets and our retained interests in securitized loans

table of contents executive summary and business outlook in  we completed two major acquisitions ing direct and the us card acquisition 
certain purchase accounting adjustments and other charges related to these acquisitions had a significant impact on our earnings in and resulted in volatility among quarterly results 
the impact of the acquisition related adjustments  however  had diminished considerably by the end of the year 
our results reflected strong contributions from the acquired businesses  as well as solid performance in our legacy businesses  despite the industry wide challenges of an uncertain and fragile economy  prolonged low interest rates and elevated regulatory expectations facing all banks 
purchase volumes  revenues and credit performance remained strong in  and our earnings  together with capital raised from equity issuances during the year  further bolstered our liquidity and regulatory capital position 
we continue to devote significant effort to integrating the operations of these acquired businesses and investing in franchise enhancements 
the combination of the ing direct and us card acquisitions has shifted the mix of our interest earning assets and driven substantial growth in our total net revenues  putting us in what we believe is a strong position to generate capital and deliver sustained shareholder value  even in the current environment of low industry growth and prolonged low interest rates 
financial highlights we reported net income of billion per diluted share on total net revenue of billion in  with each of our three business segments contributing to our earnings 
in comparison  we reported net income of billion per diluted share on total net revenue of billion in and net income of billion per diluted share on total net revenue of billion in our tier common ratio  as calculated under basel i  increased to as of december   up from as of december  the increase in our tier common ratio reflected strong internal capital generation from earnings  as well as capital raised from equity issuances during the year 
based on our current interpretation of the proposed rules for implementing basel iii  we believe we are well positioned to meet our fully phased in assumed tier common ratio target under basel iii of approximately in early our tier risk based capital ratio  as calculated under basel i  was as of december   down from as of december  the decrease was primarily driven by the significant increase in risk weighted assets resulting from the ing direct and us card acquisitions  which more than offset the benefit of an increase in tier capital 
see capital management below for additional information 
below are additional highlights of our performance in these highlights generally are based on a comparison between our and results  except as otherwise noted 
the changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of december   compared with our financial condition and credit performance as of december  we provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this executive summary and business outlook 
total company earnings our net income of billion in increased by million  or  from the increase in net income reflected the favorable impact of higher total net revenue from our legacy businesses  increased revenues from acquired businesses and a bargain purchase gain of million recorded at closing of the ing direct acquisition 
the increase in net revenue was largely offset by post acquisition charges related to the us card acquisition  including a provision for credit losses of billion to establish an initial allowance for the approximately billion in outstanding credit card receivables from the us card acquisition designated as held for investment that had existing revolving privileges at acquisition and an initial charge of million to establish a reserve for estimated uncollectible billed 
table of contents finance charges and fees for these loans 
in addition  non interest expense grew substantially due to higher operating expenses and merger related expenses related to our recent acquisitions  as well as higher infrastructure expenses resulting from continued investments in our home and auto loan businesses 
total loans period end loans held for investment increased by billion  or  in to billion as of december   from billion as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of the acquired ing direct loan portfolio of billion and the receivables acquired in the us card acquisition designated as held for investment of billion 
excluding the impact of the addition of these loans  period end loans held for investment increased by billion  or 
the increase reflected strong commercial loan growth and continued growth in auto loans  which was partially offset by the continued expected run off of installment loans in our credit card business and home loans in our consumer banking business 
charge off and delinquency statistics our net charge off rate decreased to in  from in the day delinquency rate also declined during the year to as of december   from as of december  as discussed above  the accounting and classification of acquired loans accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected may significantly alter some of our reported credit quality metrics 
the credit mark established in conjunction with acquired loans from the ing direct and us card acquisitions absorbed a significant portion of the uncollectible amounts that we would have recorded as charge offs on these portfolios in the second and third quarters of  resulting in unusually low net charge off rates in each of these quarters 
by the fourth quarter of  the credit mark impact related to the us card acquisition had diminished  with no meaningful impact on net charge offs in the quarter 
we provide information on our credit quality metrics  excluding the impact of acquired loans accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected  below under business segments and credit risk profile 
allowance for loan and lease losses we increased our allowance by million in to billion as of december  in comparison  we reduced our allowance by billion in the increase in the allowance in was primarily attributable to the initial allowance build of billion in the second quarter of that we established for the approximately billion in outstanding credit card receivables from the us card acquisition that had existing revolving privileges at acquisition  as well as growth in auto loan balances 
excluding the initial allowance build of billion established for the receivables acquired in the us card acquisition  we recorded an allowance release of million in primarily attributable to a significant improvement in underlying credit performance trends in our commercial banking business 
although the allowance increased in  the coverage ratio of the allowance to total loans held for investment fell to as of december   from as of december  the decrease in the allowance coverage ratio was largely due to the i addition of the receivables acquired in the ing direct and us card acquisitions accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected  for which we did not record an allowance in accordance with the required accounting guidance for these loans  and ii improved credit performance for our commercial loan portfolio 
representation and warranty reserve we recorded a provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses of million in  compared with a provision of million in the increase in the provision in was primarily driven by updated estimates of anticipated outcomes from various litigation and threatened litigation in the insured securitization segment based on relevant factual and legal developments and settlements during the year with a government sponsored enterprise gse to resolve present and future claims 
our representation and warranty reserve decreased to million as of december   from million as of december   largely due to settlements during as of december   our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what is in our reserve was approximately billion  an increase from our previous estimates of billion as of september   and billion as of december  we provide additional information on the representation and warranty reserve in critical accounting policies 
table of contents and estimates representation and warranty reserve and note commitments  contingencies and guarantees 
business segments credit card our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of billion in  compared with net income from continuing operations of billion in the decrease in earnings in was largely due to significant post acquisition charges related to the us card acquisition  including a provision for credit losses of billion to establish an initial allowance for outstanding credit card receivables from the us card acquisition with existing revolving privileges at acquisition  pccr intangible amortization expense of million and higher operating expenses resulting from the us card acquisition 
the unfavorable impact of these charges diminished the favorable impact of the substantial increase in total net revenue resulting from the addition of credit card receivables from the us card acquisition 
period end loans in our credit card business increased by billion  or  in  to billion as of december  the increase was primarily due to the addition of the billion in outstanding receivables classified as held for investment 
excluding the addition of the acquired receivables  period end loans held for investment decreased by billion  or  due to the expected continued run off of our installment loan portfolio 
consumer banking our consumer banking business generated net income from continuing operations of billion in  compared with net income from continuing operations of million in the increase in earnings was attributable to growth in total net revenue  which was partially offset by higher non interest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses 
growth in revenue stemmed from higher average loan balances resulting from increased auto loan originations and added home loans from the ing direct acquisition  coupled with the significant increase in deposits from the ing direct acquisition 
the increase in non interest expense was largely due to operating expenses associated with ing direct  higher infrastructure expenditures related to our home loan business and growth in auto originations and higher marketing expenditures in our retail banking operations 
the increase in the provision for credit losses was largely due to higher auto loan balances resulting from growth in auto loan originations 
period end loans in our consumer banking business increased by billion  or  in to billion as of december   primarily due to the acquisition of billion of ing direct home loans and growth in auto loan originations 
excluding the addition of the acquired ing direct loans  period end loans held for investment decreased by billion  or  due to the expected continued run off of our acquired home loan portfolios 
commercial banking our commercial banking business generated net income from continuing operations of million in  compared with net income from continuing operations of million in the improvement in results for commercial banking was attributable to an increase in revenues driven by increased average loan balances as well as a decrease in the provision for credit losses due to improving credit trends 
these factors were partially offset by higher non interest expense resulting from operating costs associated with the increased volume of loan originations in our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial businesses  increased infrastructure expenditures and the expansion into new markets 
period end loans increased by billion  or  in to billion as of december  the increase was driven by stronger loan originations in the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate businesses  which was partially offset by the run off and sale of a portion of the small ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio 

table of contents recent developments redemption of trust preferred securities as of december   we had outstanding trust preferred securities with a combined aggregate principal amount of billion that previously qualified as tier capital 
on january   we redeemed all of our outstanding trust preferred securities  which generally carried a higher coupon cost  ranging from to  than other funding sources available to us 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities is to be phased out over a three year period starting on january  subordinated note exchange on january   we announced the commencement of an any and all exchange offer for cobna s billion of outstanding subordinated notes due the transaction involved offering current holders market value plus an exchange premium for these outstanding notes  which was consideration paid through a combination of new year subordinated bank notes and cash 
the exchange offer expired on february  pursuant to the exchange offer  cobna exchanged approximately of its outstanding subordinated notes due for new subordinated notes due credit card securitization on february   we executed our first credit card securitization transaction since by issuing million of year  aaa rated fixed rate notes from our credit card securitization trust 
sale of best buy card portfolio on february   we announced an agreement to sell the portfolio of best buy stores  lp best buy private label and co branded credit card accounts that we acquired in the us card acquisition to citibank  na citi 
at the time of the announcement  the portfolio had loan balances of approximately billion 
in addition  we and best buy have agreed to end our contractual credit card relationship early 
the sale of the loans to citi  which is subject to customary closing conditions  and early termination of the best buy partnership are expected to be finalized in the third quarter of in the first quarter of  the assets subject to the sale agreement were transferred to the held for sale category 
upon closing  we expect that the proceeds from the sale will approximate the book value of the accounts  resulting in no significant gain or loss on the transaction

risk factors in this report for factors that could materially influence our results 

table of contents total company expectations our strategies and actions are designed to deliver and sustain strong returns and capital generation through the acquisition and retention of franchise enhancing customer relationships across our businesses 
we believe that franchise enhancing customer relationships create and sustain significant long term value through low credit costs  long and loyal customer relationships and a gradual build in loan balances and revenues over time 
examples of franchise enhancing customer relationships include rewards customers and new partnerships in our credit card business  retail deposit customers in our consumer banking business and primary banking relationships with commercial customers in our commercial banking business 
we intend to grow these customer relationships by continuing to invest in scalable infrastructure and operating platforms that are appropriate for a bank of our size and business mix so that we can meet the rising regulatory and compliance expectations facing all banks and deliver a brand defining customer experience that builds and sustains a valuable  long term customer franchise 
the ing direct and us card acquisitions strengthened and expanded our customer base  and  over time  we expect to expand and deepen our customer relationships with new products and services 
we expect average interest earning assets will decline in we expect average loan balances for full year to decline from average loan balances in the fourth quarter of  as significant run off of mortgage and card loans we acquired  coupled with the sale of the best buy loan portfolio  is partially offset by growth in our businesses 
we expect run off and sales of approximately billion in ending loan balances in  primarily comprised of approximately billion in run off of mortgage loans acquired from ing direct and chevy chase bank  approximately billion from the sale of the best buy loan portfolio and approximately billion in run off of other credit card loans purchased in the us card acquisition 
we expect this decline to be partially offset by growth in certain of our businesses  including parts of domestic card  auto and commercial banking 
however  we expect continued weak consumer demand across our credit card and auto lending businesses  as well as intensifying competition in several businesses  particularly auto and commercial and industrial lending 
we expect net interest margin to be modestly higher in versus levels  with steady yield on average earning assets and an expected reduction in interest expense 
we expect overall non interest expense in to total approximately billion  or just over billion on average per quarter 
we expect total annual non interest expense  excluding marketing  to be approximately billion dollars in and marketing expense for to be approximately billion 
we believe our actions have created a well positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity levels  and a strong capital generation trajectory 
we expect to exceed an assumed basel iii tier common ratio internal target of percent in early our estimated basel iii capital trajectory includes the estimated impact of implementing the basel ii advanced approaches to calculate regulatory capital  which we expect will apply to us in or later 
the assumed basel iii tier common ratio target assumes a buffer of basis points for a systemically important financial institution sifi under applicable rules and regulations and a further buffer of basis points to cover potential volatility in both the numerator and denominator of the tier common ratio 
our actual operating levels for capital will vary over time depending on our outlook on near to medium term growth  our view of where we are in the economic cycle and our resilience under ongoing stress testing processes 
the assumed basel iii tier common level is estimated based on our current interpretation  expectations and understanding of the basel iii capital rules and other capital regulations proposed by us regulators and the application of such rules to our businesses as currently conducted 
basel iii calculations are necessarily subject to change based on  among other things  the scope and terms of the final rules and regulations  model calibration and other implementation guidance  changes in our businesses and certain actions of management  including those affecting the composition of our balance sheet 
we believe this ratio provides useful information to investors and others by measuring our progress against expected future regulatory capital standards 

table of contents business segment expectations credit card business as noted above  in domestic card  the closing of the us card acquisition has impacted and will continue to affect quarterly trends in loan growth  revenue margin and credit metrics 
we anticipate that the run off of parts of the portfolio acquired in the us card acquisition as well as anticipated run off of in our installment loan portfolio will more than offset the underlying growth trajectory in other parts of our domestic card business resulting in a modest decline in full year average loan balances in from average loan balances in the fourth quarter of in addition  the sale of the best buy loan portfolio will result in an incremental reduction in loans held for investment of approximately billion 
we expect charge off levels to remain relatively stable with normal seasonal patterns in as we have disclosed in the past  we are taking actions that we believe will enhance our franchise  such as aligning customer practices related to the us card acquisition with our own  and ending the sale of products like payment protection  which will have a modest negative impact on revenue margin 
we also expect that the run off of higher margin  higher loss receivables purchased in the us card acquisition will change the mix of loans in our domestic card business  driving a further modest reduction of revenue margin in we expect the sale of the best buy portfolio  which resulted in our transferring these loans to held for sale from held for investment in the first quarter of  and the related held for sale loan accounting will increase our revenue margins until the sale of the loans 
other factors which we are unable to accurately predict will also affect revenue margin 
these factors  which include market and pricing dynamics  credit trends  and competitive intensity  could have positive or negative impacts on the domestic card revenue margin 
consumer banking business in our consumer banking business  we expect the ing direct acquisition to continue to have a significant impact on consumer banking loan volumes as we anticipate that run off in the acquired home loans portfolio will more than offset growth in auto loans 
commercial banking business our commercial banking business continues to grow loans  deposits  and revenues as we attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing customers 
although we anticipate some quarterly fluctuations in nonperforming loan and charge off rates  we expect our commercial banking business to continue strong and relatively steady performance trends throughout critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements 
we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies in note summary of significant accounting policies 

table of contents we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition 
these critical accounting policies govern loan loss reserves asset impairment fair value representation and warranty reserve customer rewards reserve income taxes we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them  as necessary  based on changing conditions 
management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed judgments and assumptions with the audit and risk committee of the board of directors 
loan loss reserves we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management s estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held for investment credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking loan portfolios as of each balance sheet date 
we maintain a separate reserve for the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans 
allowance for loan and lease losses we have an established process  using analytical tools  benchmarks and management judgment  to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics and record a provision for credit losses 
we build our allowance for loan and lease losses and unfunded lending commitment reserves through the provision for credit losses 
our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge offs and the level of allowance for loan and lease losses that we determine is necessary to provide for probable loan and lease losses incurred that are inherent in our loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we recorded a provision for credit losses of billion  billion and billion in   and  respectively 
the allowance totaled billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  we review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis 
our assessment involves evaluating many factors including  but not limited to  historical loss and recovery experience  recent trends in delinquencies and charge offs  risk ratings  the impact of bankruptcy filings  the value of collateral underlying secured loans  account seasoning  changes in our credit evaluation  underwriting and collection management policies  seasonality  general economic conditions  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses 
key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates  home prices  and the valuation of commercial properties  consumer real estate  and autos 
although we examine a variety of externally available data  as well as our internal loan performance data  to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses  our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties  including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance 
accordingly  our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations 
for example  excluding the initial allowance build of billion established for certain loans related to the us card acquisition  we recorded an allowance release of million in  attributable to a significant improvement in underlying credit performance trends in our commercial banking business 
similarly  as a result of improving credit performance trends during  charge offs began to decrease across all of our business segments  and we recorded a significant allowance release of billion in 
table of contents we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in note summary of significant accounting policies 
we provide information on the components of our allowance  disaggregated by impairment methodology  and changes in our allowance in note allowance for loan and lease losses 
finance charge and fee reserve we recognize finance charges and fees on credit card loans as revenue when the amounts are billed to the customer and include these amounts in the loan balance  net of the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees 
we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off  however  when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue 
total net revenue was reduced by million  million and million in    respectively  for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees 
the finance charge and fee reserve totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  we review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis 
our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is primarily based on the use of a roll rate methodology and consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables 
accordingly  the estimation process is subject to similar risks and uncertainties  including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance 
we refine our estimation process and key assumptions used in determining our loss reserves as additional information becomes available 
changes in key assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of billed finance charges and fees we estimate as uncollectible in each period 
for example  in the third quarter of  we revised the manner in which we estimate expected recoveries of finance charge and fee amounts previously considered to be uncollectible 
our revised recovery assumptions better reflected the post recession pattern of relatively low delinquency roll rates combined with increased recoveries of finance charges and fees previously considered uncollectible 
this change in assumptions resulted in a reduction in our uncollectible finance charge and fee reserves of approximately million and a corresponding increase in revenues 
we also applied these revised assumptions to the estimated recovery of principal charge offs in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses 
asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio  we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable impairment accounting guidance 
this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions 
our investment securities and goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our other assets 
accordingly  below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process 
investment securities we regularly review investment securities for other than temporary impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria 
if we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost  we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists 
our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors  including  but not limited to  the extent and duration of the impairment  the health of and specific prospects for the issuer  including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments  recent events specific to the issuer and or 
table of contents industry to which the issuer belongs  the payment structure of the security  external credit ratings  the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions

goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  including hibernia corporation in  north fork bancorporation in  chevy chase bank in  and the us card acquisition we have goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulting from business combinations after january   is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
goodwill totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
other intangible assets  which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets  consist primarily of pccr and core deposit intangibles 
the net carrying value of other intangible assets increased to billion as of december   from million as of december  the increase was primarily due to the pccr intangible of billion recorded in connection with the us card acquisition on may  goodwill and other intangible assets together represented and of our total assets as of december  and  respectively 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment on an annual basis or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment 
a reporting unit is a business segment or one level below 
our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing are domestic card  international card  auto finance  other consumer banking and commercial banking 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units as of october each year using a two step process 
first  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value  the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary 
if  however  the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any  for that reporting unit 
we do not maintain separate balance sheets at the reporting unit level  therefore  we determine the carrying values of our reporting units based on an economic capital approach  in which we calculate each reporting unit s capital requirements based on the individual reporting units capital allocation rates applied to their outstanding loans and deposits plus specifically assigned goodwill and intangible assets 
the capital allocation rates are approved by our chief executive officer and executive team on an annual basis and are based on our current regulatory requirements and reporting unit specific risks and capital structures 
the economic capital approach appropriately reflects the carrying value of each our reporting units based on the capital allocated to and managed at each of those reporting units 
we compare the total reporting unit carrying values to our total consolidated stockholders equity  as discussed further in note goodwill and other intangible assets  to assess the appropriateness of our methodology 
if the second step of goodwill impairment testing is required for a reporting unit  we undertake an extensive effort to build the specific reporting unit s balance sheet for the test based on applicable accounting guidance 
estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets  liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments  particularly related to cash flows  the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium 
management judgment is required to assess 
table of contents whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit 
there are widely accepted valuation methodologies  such as the market approach earnings multiples and or transaction multiples and or income approach discounted cash flow methods  that are used to estimate the fair value of reporting units 
in applying these methodologies  we utilize a number of factors  including actual operating results  future business plans  economic projections  and market data 
we also may engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in our valuation process 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment analyses  fair values can be sensitive to changes in the projected cash flows and assumptions 
in some instances  minor changes in the assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount 
furthermore  a prolonged decrease or increase in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying amount 
also  to the extent step two of the goodwill analyses is required  changes in the estimated fair values of individual assets and liabilities may impact other estimates of fair value for assets or liabilities and result in a different amount of implied goodwill  and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
in conducting our goodwill impairment test for  we determined the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis  a form of the income approach 
our discounted cash flow analysis required management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth  revenue growth  loan and lease losses  and capital rates 
we relied on each reporting unit s internal cash flow forecast and calculated a terminal value using a growth rate that reflected the nominal growth rate of the economy as a whole and appropriate discount rates for the respective reporting units 
we adjusted cash flows as necessary to maintain each reporting unit s equity capital requirements 
the cash flows were discounted to present value using reporting unit specific discount rates that were largely based on our external cost of equity  adjusted for risks inherent in each reporting unit 
we corroborated the key inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis with market data  where available  to validate that our assumptions were within a reasonable range of observable market data 
based on the results of step one of our goodwill impairment test  we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units  including goodwill  significantly exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit 
fair value as a percentage of carrying value for our five reporting units ranged from to  with the international reporting unit being at the low end of this range 
as such  none of our reporting units was at risk of failing step one of the impairment test 
accordingly  the goodwill for each of our reporting units was considered not impaired 
therefore  the second step of impairment testing was not required 
as part of the annual goodwill impairment test  we assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined that any excess fair value in our reporting units at that time could be attributed to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry 
we will continue to regularly monitor our market capitalization in  overall economic conditions and other events or circumstances that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future 
we did not recognize goodwill impairment in either or other intangible assets intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss  generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
we did not recognize impairment on other intangible assets in  or

fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
the fair value accounting guidance provides a three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments 
this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level unobservable inputs the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters 
when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
changes in market conditions  such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities  may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value 
we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions 
if markets are determined to be inactive  it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received 
when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs  it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs 
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are included in level or level in making this determination  we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used 
based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category  judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis represented approximately of our total reported assets of billion as of december   compared with of our total reported assets of billion as of december  financial assets for which the fair value was determined using significant level inputs represented approximately and of these financial instruments less than of total assets as of december  and  respectively 
we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments  including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs  in note fair value of financial instruments 

table of contents key controls over fair value measurement we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable 
our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties 
our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types  price verification and review of valuation judgments  methods  models  process controls and results 
groups independent from our trading and investing functions  including our valuations group  model validation group and fair value committee fvc  participate in the review and validation process 
the fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved at the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee vac for resolution 
the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer 
membership of the vac includes the chief risk officer 
our valuations group performs periodic independent verification of fair value measurements by using independent analytics and other available market data to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable 
for example  in cases where we rely on third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures  we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources  including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources  where necessary 
additional validation procedures performed by the valuations group include reviewing either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values valuation inputs and assumptions  and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices 
the validation group periodically evaluates alternative methodologies and recommends improvements to valuation techniques 
we perform due diligence reviews of the third party pricing services by comparing their prices with prices from other sources and reviewing other control documentation 
additionally  when necessary  we challenge prices from third party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process 
this may include a request for a transparency of the assumptions used by the third party 
the fvc  which includes representation from business areas  our risk management division and our finance division  is a forum for discussing fair valuations  inputs  assumptions  methodologies  variance thresholds  valuation control environment and material risks or concerns related to fair valuations 
additionally  the fvc is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the valuations control group 
it provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment 
the fvc regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance 
the chief financial officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the audit and risk committee or other delegated committee of the board of directors 
we have a model policy  established by an independent model risk office  which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing 
representation and warranty reserve in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan  indemnify the investor or insurer  or reimburse the investor for loan and lease losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary  including both litigation and 
table of contents non litigation liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors  depending on the category of purchaser and rely on historical data 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the historical relationship between loan losses and repurchase outcomes  the percentage of current and future loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests over the lifetime of the loans  the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases  and estimated collateral valuations 
we evaluate these factors and update our loss forecast models on a quarterly basis to estimate our lifetime liability 
our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage repurchase reserves  which we report as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on  among other things  actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests  the actual success rates of claimants  developments in litigation  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
as part of our business planning processes  we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are reasonably possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards 
as of december   our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what is in our reserve was approximately billion  an increase from our previous estimates of billion as of september   and billion as of december  notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information  it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses 
this estimate involves considerable judgment  and reflects that there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels  including  but not limited to  anticipated litigation outcomes  future repurchase and indemnification claim levels  ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates  future mortgage loan performance levels  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
in light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters  an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period

customer rewards reserve we offer products  primarily credit cards  which offer reward program members with various rewards  such as cash  airline tickets or merchandise 
the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the number of reward points an eligible card member may earn 
customer rewards costs  which we generally record as an offset to interchange income  are driven by various factors  such as card member charge volume  customer participation in the rewards program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners 
we establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management s judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost 
we use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends  current enrollee redemption behavior  card product type  year of program enrollment  enrollment tenure and card spend levels 
our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed 
we use a weighted average cost per reward redeemed during the previous twelve months  adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs  including mix of rewards redeemed  to estimate future redemption costs 

table of contents we continually evaluate our reserve methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns  cost per point redeemed  contract changes and other factors 
changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by card members as of the end of the reporting period 
we recognized customer rewards expense of billion  billion and million in  and  respectively 
our customer rewards liability  which is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
income taxes our annual provision for income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and other provisions of tax law applicable to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment  including evaluating uncertainties  is required in determining our tax positions and calculating our tax expense 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
our income tax expense consists of two components current and deferred taxes 
our current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period 
it also includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions and revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes resulting from the resolution of income tax controversies 
our deferred income tax expense results from changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources  including taxable income in carryback years  reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecasts to provide insight 
we had deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances  of billion as of december   compared with billion at december  we had a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to fully realize in future periods the net deferred tax asset of billion recorded as of december  if changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years  we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income

net interest income of billion for increased by billion  or  from  driven by a increase in average interest earning assets  which was partially offset by an basis points decline in our net interest margin to 
average interest earning assets the significant increase in average interest earning assets reflects the addition of the ing direct loan portfolio of billion in the first quarter of and the addition of the billion in outstanding receivables acquired in the us card acquisition and designated as held for investment in the second quarter of growth in average interest earning assets also was driven by strong commercial loan growth and continued growth in auto loans  which was partially offset by the continued expected run off of installment loans in our credit card business and home loans in our consumer banking business  as well as the expected run off of higher margin  higher loss receivables acquired in the us card acquisition 
the run off of home loans has accelerated slightly as a result of the low mortgage interest rate environment 
net interest margin the decrease in our net interest margin was attributable to a decline in the average yield on our interest earning assets  largely due to the shift in the mix of our interest earning assets to a larger proportion of lower yielding assets resulting from the acquired ing direct home loan and investment security portfolios and temporarily higher cash balances from the recent equity and debt offerings 
the ing direct interest earning assets generally have lower yields than our legacy loan and investment security portfolios 
in addition  the establishment of a finance charge and fee reserve of million in the second quarter of for the receivables acquired in the us card acquisition and premium amortization related to the ing 
table of contents direct and us card acquisitions of million in contributed to the reduction in the average yield on interest earning assets 
the decrease in the average yield on interest earnings assets was partially offset by a reduction in our cost of funds 
we have continued to benefit from the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources and a decline in deposit interest rates as a result of the continued overall low interest rate environment 
net interest income of billion for increased by million  or  from  driven by a basis points expansion in our net interest margin to  which was partially offset by a modest decrease in average interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets the decrease in average interest earning assets in reflected the continued run off of businesses that we exited or repositioned  including our installment  home loan and small ticket commercial real estate loan portfolios  which was slightly offset by the impact of modest revolving credit card loan growth  the addition of the existing hbc credit card loan portfolio of billion in the first quarter of and the addition of the existing kohl s private label credit card loan portfolio of billion in the second quarter of net interest margin the increase in our net interest margin in reflected the favorable impact of a reduction in cost of funds  which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets 
the improvement in our cost of funds was attributable the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources and a decline in deposit interest rates as a result of the overall low interest rate environment 
the decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets was largely due to the addition of the kohl s portfolio 
under our partnership agreement with kohl s  we share a fixed percentage of revenues  consisting of finance charges and late fees 
we report revenues related to kohl s credit card loans on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements  which has the effect of reducing the yield on our average interest earning assets 
the reduction in the average yield due to the addition of the kohl s portfolio was partially offset by the run off of lower margin installment loans  a reduced level of new accounts with low introductory promotional rates and an increase in the recognition of billed finance charges and fees due to improved credit performance as well as a change we made in the third quarter of in our estimation of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve

fair value was determined by discounting all expected cash flows contractual principal  interest  finance charges and fees of billion less those amounts not expected to be collected of billion at a market discount rate 
under applicable accounting guidance  we are required to amortize the net premium of million over the contractual principal amount as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining life of the loans

business segment financial performance our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments  which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking 
the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments 
certain activities that are not part of a segment  such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset liability management by our centralized corporate treasury group  are included in the other category 
the results of our individual businesses  which we report on a continuing operations basis  reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating 
table of contents resources 
our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business 
we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results 
our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies  including funds transfer pricing  to assign certain balance sheet assets  deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment 
total interest income and net fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported 
the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process  which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration market rates 
our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds  such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses  and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment 
the allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses 
we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment 
in the first quarter of  we re aligned the loan categories reported by our commercial banking business and the loan customer and product types included within each category 
as a result of this re alignment  we now report three product categories commercial and multifamily real estate  commercial and industrial loans and small ticket commercial real estate  which is a run off portfolio 
we previously reported four categories within our commercial banking business commercial and multifamily real estate  middle market  specialty lending and small ticket commercial real estate 
middle market and specialty lending related products are included in commercial and industrial loans 
all affordable housing tax related investments  some of which were previously included in the other segment  are now included in the commercial and multifamily real estate category of our commercial banking business 
prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation 
we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation  which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on us gaap 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to us gaap  therefore  the managed basis presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies 
in addition  our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with us gaap 
below we summarize our business segment results for  and and provide a comparative discussion of these results 
we also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance statistics as of december   compared with december  we provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in note business segments

this increase reflected commercial loan growth and continued growth in auto loans  which was partially offset by the continued expected run off of loans in businesses we exited or repositioned  other loan pay downs and charge offs 
the run off portfolios include installment loans in our credit card business  home loans in our consumer banking business and small ticket commercial real estate loans in our commercial banking business

potential mortgage representation warranty liabilities in recent years  we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold them to various purchasers  including purchasers who created securitization trusts 
these subsidiaries are capital one home loans  which was acquired in february  greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint  which was acquired in december as part of the north fork acquisition  and chevy chase bank  which was acquired in february and subsequently merged into cona 

table of contents we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
these reserves are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 
we build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses  which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non interest income for loans originated and sold by ccb and capital one home loans and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by greenpoint 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser 
the aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries totaled million as of december   compared with million as of september   and million as of december  the decrease in the reserve in was driven primarily by the settlement of claims

off balance sheet arrangements and variable interest entities in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies  partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities vies 
some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements  depending on the nature or structure of  and accounting required to be applied to  the arrangement 
these arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms  including securitization and servicing activities  the purchase or sale of mortgage backed or other asset backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to vies that hold debt  equity  real estate or other assets 
our continuing involvement in unconsolidated vies primarily consists of interests in certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities

we provide a discussion of our activities related to these vies in note variable interest entities and securitizations 
capital management the level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors  including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and an internal risk based capital assessment  and may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines  subsidiary capital requirements  the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments 
capital standards and prompt corrective action bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  respectively 
the capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of assets and off balance sheet items 
under the capital adequacy standards  bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage capital ratio of at least for banks that meet certain specified criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating in order to be considered adequately capitalized 
national banks also are subject to prompt corrective action capital regulations 
under prompt corrective action regulations  a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a tier risk based capital ratio of at least basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard  a total risk based capital ratio of at least basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and is not subject to any supervisory agreement  order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital reserve 
a bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it meets these minimum capital ratios and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition 
currently  prompt corrective action capital requirements do not apply to bank holding companies 
we also disclose a tier common ratio for our bank holding company  which is a regulatory capital measure widely used by investors  analysts  rating agencies and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies 
there is currently no mandated minimum or well capitalized standard for the tier common ratio  instead the risk based capital rules state that voting common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier common capital 
in addition  we disclose a non gaap tce ratio in item selected financial data 
while the tier common and tce ratios are capital measures widely used by investors  analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies  they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we provide information on the calculation of these ratios in supplemental tables table f reconciliation of non gaap measures and calculation of regulatory capital measures under basel i

recent developments in capital and liquidity requirements as of december   we had outstanding trust preferred securities with a combined aggregate principal amount of billion that previously qualified as tier capital 
on january   we redeemed all of our outstanding trust preferred securities  which generally carried a higher coupon cost  ranging from to  than other funding sources available to us 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities is to be phased out over a three year period starting on january  in june  the federal reserve  occ and fdic released proposed rules that would increase the general risk based capital ratio minimum requirements  modify the definition of regulatory capital  establish a minimum tier

in november  the federal reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us commonly referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar 
under the rules  bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more must submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the federal reserve before making most capital distributions 
the purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust  forward looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress 
as part of its evaluation of a capital plan  the federal reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan  the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy  and the ability of the bank holding company to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier common ratio of on a pro forma basis under both expected and stressful conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters 
we submitted a comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar to the federal reserve on january  along with eighteen other large us banking organizations 
we expect to incorporate any feedback from our regulators in response to the ccar submission in our ongoing capital management planning 
any proposed dividend increase or other capital action must be approved as a part of ccar

risk management overview risk management is a critical part of our business model  as all financial institutions are exposed to a variety of risks that can significantly affect their financial performance 
our business activities expose us to eight major categories of risk credit risk  liquidity risk  market risk  compliance risk  operational risk  legal risk  reputational risk and strategic risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a borrower s or a counterparty s inability to meet its financial or contractual obligations 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our future financial obligations as they come due or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period 

table of contents market risk market risk is the risk that an institution s earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  or prices of other financial instruments 
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of financial loss due to regulatory fines or penalties  restriction or suspension of business activities or costs of mandatory corrective action incurred by not adhering to applicable laws  regulations  principles and supervisory guidance  as well as our own internal standards intended to adhere to these laws and regulations 
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss  capital impairment  adverse customer experience  or reputation impact resulting from inadequate or failed internal process  people  and systems  or from external events 
legal risk legal risk represents the risk of material adverse impact due to new or changes in laws and regulations  new interpretations of law  the drafting  interpretation and enforceability of contracts  adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory scrutiny  the establishment  management and governance of our legal entity structure  or the failure to seek or follow appropriate legal counsel when needed 
reputation risk reputation risk is the risk to market value  recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external stakeholders regarding our business strategies and activities 
strategic risk strategic risk is the risk that results from adverse business decisions  ineffective or inappropriate business plans  or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment  business cycles  customer preferences  product obsolescence  regulatory environment  business strategy execution  and or other inherent risks of the business 
we discuss below our overall risk management principles  roles and responsibilities  framework and risk appetite 
following this section  we address in more detail the specific procedures  measures and analysis of the major categories of risks that we manage 
risk management principles our risk management framework is intended to identify  assess and mitigate risks that affect or have the potential to affect our business 
we target financial returns that compensate us for the amount of risk that we take and avoid excessive risk taking 
our risk management framework incorporates the three lines of defense risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles  responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk 
using the three lines of defense model  we follow these central guiding principles the first line of defense is comprised of the business areas and staff groups that through their day to day business activities take risk on our behalf 
as the business owner  the first line is responsible for identifying  assessing  managing and controlling that risk  and for mitigating our overall risk exposure 
the second line of defense provides oversight of first line risk taking and management  and is comprised of our risk management organization and other staff control functions 
the second line assists in determining risk capacity  risk appetite  and the strategies  policies and structure for managing risks 
the third line of defense is comprised of our internal audit and credit review functions 
the third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the board of directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well designed and working as intended 
our approach is reflected in six critical risk management practices of particular importance in the financial services industry due to changing regulatory environments and ongoing economic uncertainty 

table of contents first  we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically 
from a strategic perspective  we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio 
from a tactical perspective  we have accumulated a sizeable liquidity reserve comprising cash  high quality  unencumbered securities  and committed collateralized credit lines and conduit facilities 
this combination of funding and liquidity sources facilitates a diverse access to multiple markets and liquidity sources 
second  we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality 
consequently  we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns 
our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting  using what we deem to be conservative assumptions 
in unsecured consumer loan underwriting  we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting 
in commercial underwriting  we generally require strong cash flow  collateral and covenants and guarantees 
in addition to sound underwriting  we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans 
third  we recognize that compliance is more complex and that regulatory and consumer expectations have risen 
in response  we have been and will continue to expand the scope and intensity of our compliance and consumer protection activities including developing requirements  approving new products  establishing procedures and controls  training staff and testing the effectiveness of business controls and the overall program 
fourth  we recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions as a result of the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and economic downturn  which has resulted in increased regulation and widespread regulatory changes 
consequently  our chief executive officer and executive team manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with the government  media and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry 
our actions include taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry and  where possible  implementing those practices in our business 
fifth  we recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on a day to day basis and have expanded our approach to operational risk management based on the growth and complexity of the company 
we are supporting our first line of defense associates with the appropriate operational risk management policy  standards  processes and tools to enable the delivery of safe  sound customer and client experiences 
finally  we recognize that maintaining a strong capital position is essential to our business strategy and competitive position 
we also recognize that regulatory and market expectations for the amount and quality of capital are rising 
understanding and managing risks to our capital position is an underlying objective of all our risk programs 
stress testing and economic capital measurement  both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum  are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns 
we also consider risks to our reputation and to our ability to access capital markets as part of our process for evaluating our capital plans 
see md a capital management for additional information on our capital adequacy and strength 
risk management roles and responsibilities the board of directors is responsible for establishing our overall risk framework  approving and overseeing execution of the enterprise risk management policy and key risk category policies  establishing our risk appetite  and regularly reviewing our risk profile 
the chief risk officer  who reports to the chief executive officer  is responsible for overseeing our risk management program and driving appropriate action to resolve any weaknesses 
the risk management program begins with a set of policies and risk appetites approved by the board that are implemented through a system of risk committees and senior executive risk stewards 
we have established risk committees at both the corporate and divisional level to identify and manage risk 
in addition  we have assigned a senior executive expert to each of eight risk categories 
we refer to these experts as risk stewards 
these executive risk stewards work with the 
table of contents lines of business  the chief risk officer and the risk committees to identify  aggregate and report risks  develop mitigation plans and controls and remediate issues 
the chief risk officer combines the results of these processes to assemble a view of our risk profile 
both management and the board of directors regularly review the risk profile 
risk management framework we use a consistent risk management framework to manage risk 
this framework applies at all levels  from the development of the enterprise risk management program itself to the tactical operations of the front line business team 
we are continuing to make changes to our risk management framework as we enhance our enterprise wide compliance risk management programs  including further expanding the three lines of defense model referenced under the risk management principles set forth above 
our risk management framework  which is built around governance  processes and people  currently consists of the following six key elements objective setting risk assessment control activities communication and information program monitoring organization and culture objective setting our risk management approach begins with objective setting 
we establish strategic  financial  operational and other objectives during our strategic and annual planning processes and throughout the year 
these objectives cascade through the organization to individual teams of associates 
the risk management approach helps identify and manage risks that have the potential to interfere with the achievement of our stated objectives 
risk assessment risk results from our strategic business choices and our day to day business activities 
risk assessment is the process of identifying our risks including emerging and potential risks  evaluating the impact of those risks and choosing and executing a response that is guided by our risk appetite 
risk assessment also includes the correlation of risks and the assessment of their cumulative effect on the overall risk profile of a line of business or of the enterprise 
control activities we consider our control activities to be the day to day backbone of our risk management 
controls provide reasonable assurance that legal  regulatory  and business requirements are being met  and identified risks are being mitigated or accepted according to our risk response choices and risk appetite 
we have practices in place designed to establish key controls and assess their effectiveness in preventing a breakdown 
control activities include the monitoring of adherence to current policy  process and procedure requirements  sign offs  and regular reporting to management 
they also include the resolution of regulatory and audit findings and issues and the procedures that trigger objective setting and risk assessments when new business opportunities are evaluated or business hierarchy changes occur 
communication and information communication and information infrastructures must be solid and are necessary to support the objective setting  risk assessment  and control activities described above 
robust risk management requires well functioning 
table of contents communication channels to inform associates of their responsibilities  alert them to issues or changes that might affect their activities  and to enable an open flow of information up  down  and across our company 
robust risk management also requires management information to enable controls to work effectively and to support the analysis needed to set objectives and assess risk accurately 
our risk governance structure is designed to support solid and ongoing communication 
specific reports and communication infrastructure are defined within our individual risk category policies 
program monitoring program monitoring is critical to our overall risk management program 
program monitoring involves assessing the accuracy  sufficiency  and effectiveness of current objectives  risk assessments  controls  ownership  communication  and management support 
the assessment of a risk program or activity can be qualitative or quantitative 
we encourage the use of measurements and metrics where it is possible  recognizing that some risks or programs cannot be measured quantitatively 
where deficiencies are discovered  we seek to update the risk management program to resolve the deficiencies in a timely manner 
significant deficiencies are escalated to the appropriate risk executive or risk committee 
clear accountability is defined when resolving deficiencies so that the desired outcome is achieved 
risk management programs are monitored at every level from the overall enterprise risk management program to the individual risk management activities in each business area 
organization and culture our intent is to create and maintain an effective risk management organization and culture 
a strong organization and culture promotes risk management as a key factor in making important business decisions and helps drive risk management activities deeper into the company 
an effective risk management culture starts with a well defined risk management philosophy 
it requires established risk management objectives that align to business objectives and make targeted risk management activities part of ongoing business management activities 
we believe we staff risk functions at the appropriate levels with qualified associates and effective tools that support risk management practices and activities 
senior management and the board of directors are ultimately accountable for promoting adherence to sound risk principles and tolerances 
we seek to incent associates at all levels to perform according to corporate policies and risk tolerance and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations 
additionally  management establishes performance goals  plans  and incentives that are designed to promote financial performance within the confines of a sound risk management program and within defined risk tolerances 
we have a corporate code of business conduct and ethics the code available on the corporate governance page of our web site at www 
capitalone 
com about under which each associate is obligated to behave with integrity in dealing with customers and business partners and to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
we disclose any waivers to the code on our web site 
we also have an associate performance management process that emphasizes achieving business results while ensuring integrity  compliance  and sound business management 
risk appetite we have a defined risk appetite for each of our eight risk categories that is approved by the board of directors 
stated risk appetites define the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and the board of directors to make business decisions 
for some risk categories credit  liquidity  market  our risk appetite statements are translated into largely quantitative limits and guidelines 
for other risk categories  our risk appetite is defined more qualitatively and is supported by indicative metrics where appropriate 
we communicate risk appetite statements  metrics and limits to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence 

table of contents primary risk categories below we provide an overview of how we manage our eight primary risk categories 
following this section  we provide detailed information and metrics about three of our most significant risk exposures credit  liquidity and market 
credit risk management the chief risk officer  in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers  is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures  including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority  and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions 
these responsibilities are fulfilled by the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer 
division presidents are responsible for managing the credit risk within their division and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines 
in addition  the chief risk officer establishes policies  delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio 
our credit policies establish standards in five areas customer selection  underwriting  monitoring  remediation  and portfolio management 
the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes 
these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process 
starting with customer selection  our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns 
we use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk  including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business 
we monitor performance and forecasts relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to the credit policy committee and to the audit and risk committee of the board 
liquidity risk management the chief financial officer is responsible for managing liquidity risk 
we assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation in both deposits and capital marketing funding sources 
management reports liquidity metrics to the asset liability management committee monthly and to the finance and trust oversight committee of the board of directors no less than quarterly 
any policy breach in a liquidity limit will result in the activation of the liquidity contingency funding plan and is required to be reported to the treasurer as soon as it is identified and to the asset liability management committee within hours 
detailed processes  requirements and controls are contained in our policies and supporting procedures 
we continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions with assessment and appropriate action plans in accordance with our liquidity contingency plan 
market risk management the chief financial officer is responsible for managing market risk 
we manage market risk exposure centrally and establish quantitative limits to control our exposure 
we define market risk as the risk that our earnings and or economic value of equity may be adversely affected by changes in market conditions  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  changes in credit spreads and price fluctuations and changes in value due to changes in market perception or the actual credit quality of issuers 
market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities  including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt and derivatives

the compliance management program provides management with guidance  training  and monitoring to provide reasonable assurance of our compliance with internal and external compliance requirements 
additionally  management and the corporate compliance department jointly and separately conduct on going monitoring and assess the state of compliance 
the assessment provides the basis for performance reporting to management and the board  allows business areas to determine if their compliance performance is acceptable  and confirms effective compliance controls are in place 
business areas embed compliance requirements and controls into their business policies  standards  processes and procedures 
they regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls

the operational risk management orm function plays an active role in monitoring adherence to our operational risk policies and standards as well as in the validation of our operational risk levels  as expressed against our appetite 
key activities performed by orm include the collection of operational breakdowns  the identification  analysis and escalation of risks and or issues  and the regular reporting of risk levels to senior management and the board 
legal risk management the general counsel is responsible for managing legal risk by providing legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and by partnering with other risk related functions such as compliance and audit

legal risk is governed by and defined in our legal risk policy 

table of contents reputation risk management the general counsel is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk 
reputation risks associated with daily interactions are managed by our business areas 
business area activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in the reputation risk management policy and other risk management policies 
each business area determines how much risk it is willing to accept and when it is prudent to execute mitigation activities 
from time to time  senior management conducts detailed assessments of our business practices and evaluates them in terms of their potential impact on capital one s reputation 
the reputation risk management policy sets forth the obligation of each business area  with direction and guidance from the reputation risk steward and his or her designee  to identify  assess and determine whether and how best to mitigate its reputation risk 
the reputation risk steward is responsible for reporting on the assessments of our aggregate reputation risk  as well as the state of our reputation with specific stakeholder groups  to the chief risk officer  the chief executive officer  the risk management committee and the audit and risk committee of the board of directors  as appropriate

credit risk profile our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure 
these activities are also governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval 
below we provide information about our primary loan products  the composition of our loan portfolio  key concentrations and credit performance metrics 
we also engage in certain non lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk  including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio  entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers  foreign exchange transactions and providing deposit overdraft services 
we provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under consolidated balance sheet analysis investment securities and credit risk related to derivative transactions in note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
primary loan products we provide a variety of lending products 
our primary products include credit cards  auto loans  home loans and commercial loans 
credit cards we market a range of credit card products across the credit spectrum and through a variety of channels 
our credit cards generally have variable interest rates 
credit card accounts are underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed 
the underwriting criteria  which are customized for individual products and marketing programs  are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues  expenses and losses  subject to a further analysis using a variety of stress conditions 
underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information  including payment history  debt burden and credit scores  such as fico  and on other factors  such as applicant income 
we maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged off 
table of contents credit card loans 
prior to february   we had not securitized any credit card loans since on february   we executed our first credit card securitization transaction in over three and a half years by issuing million of year  aaa rated  fixed rate notes under our credit card securitization trust

loan size limits are customized by program and subject to a current maximum of  similar to credit card accounts  the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues  expenses and losses  subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions 
underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant s income  estimated debt to income ratio  and credit bureau information  along with collateral characteristics such as loan to value ratio 
we generally retain all of our auto loans  though we have securitized auto loans and sold charged off auto loans in the past and may do so in the future 
home loans most of the existing home loans in our loan portfolio were originated by banks we acquired 
the underwriting standards for these loans were less restrictive than our current underwriting standards 
currently  we originate residential mortgage and home equity loans through our branches  direct marketing  and dedicated home loan officers 
our home loan products include conforming and non conforming fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans  as well as first and second lien home equity loans and lines of credit

we may  in limited instances  use automated valuation models to determine home values 
commercial loans 
we offer a range of commercial lending products  including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market industrial and service companies 
our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate  however  the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates 
our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower s financial condition and prospects  as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates 
where relevant  we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees 
we maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify  where applicable  guidelines for debt service coverage  leverage  loan to value ratio and standard covenants and conditions 
we assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower  industry segment  source of repayment  the underlying collateral and guarantees if any and current market conditions 
although we generally retain commercial loans  we may syndicate large positions for risk mitigation purposes 
in addition  we have sold impaired commercial loans in the past and may do so in the future 
loan portfolio composition total loans that we manage consist of held for investment loans recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and loans held in our securitization trusts 
loans underlying our securitization trusts are reported on our consolidated balance sheets in restricted loans for securitization investors 
table presents the composition of our total loan portfolio  by business segment  as of december  and table also displays acquired loans accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected  which consists of a limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the us card acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ing direct and chevy chase bank acquisitions

because of the diversity of our credit card products and national marketing approach  no single geographic concentration exists within the credit card portfolio 
consumer banking accounted for billion  or  of our loan portfolio as of december   compared with billion  or  of our loan portfolio as of december  the auto portfolio is originated primarily on a national basis  with additional originations through our retail branch network 
the home loan portfolio is concentrated in new york  california and louisiana which reflects the characteristics of the legacy hibernia  north fork and chevy chase bank portfolios that comprise the majority of our home loans 
retail banking includes small business loans and other consumer lending products originated through our branch network 

table of contents commercial banking represented billion  or  of our loan portfolio as of december   compared with billion  or  as of december  we operate our commercial banking business primarily in geographic regions where we maintain retail bank branches 
accordingly  the portfolio is concentrated in new york  louisiana and texas  which represent our largest retail banking markets 
our small ticket commercial real estate portfolio  which was originated on a national basis through a broker network  is in a run off mode 
we provide additional information on the geographic concentration  by loan category  of our loan portfolio in note loans 
loans acquired as noted above  our portfolio of loans held for investment consists of loans acquired in the chevy chase bank  ing direct and us card acquisitions 
these loans were recorded at fair value as of the date of each acquisition 
we elect to account for all purchased loans using the guidance for accounting for purchased credit impaired loans  which is based on expected cash flows  unless specifically scoped out of the guidance 
loans acquired and accounted for based on expected cash flows we use the term acquired loans to refer to a limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the us card acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ing direct and chevy chase bank acquisitions  which are accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected 
acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected increased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  the increase was largely due to acquired loans from the ing direct acquisition 
we regularly update our estimate of the amount of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results on an aggregated pool basis for loans with common risk characteristics 
probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through our provision for credit losses 
probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition  with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans 
we increased the allowance and recorded a provision for credit losses of million in related to certain pools of acquired loans 
the cumulative impairment recognized on acquired loans totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the credit performance of the remaining pools has generally been in line with our expectations  and  in some cases  more favorable than expected  which has resulted in the reclassification of amounts from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield 
loans acquired and accounted for based on contractual cash flows of the loans acquired in the us card acquisition  there were loans of billion designated as held for investment that had existing revolving privileges at acquisition and were therefore excluded from the accounting guidance applied to the acquired loans described in the paragraphs above 
these loans were recorded at a fair value of billion  resulting in a net premium of million at acquisition 
fair value was determined by discounting all expected cash flows contractual principal  interest  finance charges and fees of billion less those amounts not expected to be collected of billion at a market discount rate 
under applicable accounting guidance  we are required to amortize the net premium of million over the contractual principal amount as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining life of the loans 
given the guidance applicable to acquired revolving loans  it is necessary to record an allowance through the provision for 
table of contents credit losses to properly recognize an estimate of incurred losses on the existing principal balances  which represents a portion of the total amounts not expected to be collected described above 
in  we recorded a provision for credit losses of billion to establish an initial allowance primarily related to these loans 
the allowance was calculated using the same methodology utilized for determining the allowance for our existing credit card portfolio 
the provision for credit losses of billion related to these loans is included in the total provision for credit losses of billion recorded in excluded from the amounts above are revolving loans acquired in the us card acquisition with a fair value of million that we designated as held for sale at acquisition 
we closed on the sale of these receivables early in the third quarter of see note summary of significant accounting policies loans for additional information on our accounting for loans  including purchased loans

we report fixed rate credit card loans with introductory rates that expire after a certain period of time as due in one year or less 
we assume that our remaining fixed rate credit card loans will mature within one to three years 
includes installment loans of million as of december  credit risk measurement we closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk 
key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates  as well as charge off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance  commercial loans 
trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios  as changes in delinquency rate provide an early warning of changes in credit losses 
the primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is risk ratings 
because we generally classify loans that have been 
table of contents delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming  the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses 
in addition to delinquency rates  the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions 
we use borrower credit scores in underwriting for most consumer loans 
we do not use credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality  because product differences  loan structure  and other factors drive large differences in credit quality for a given credit score  and because a borrower s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator of credit quality 
we continuously adjust our credit line management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes 
as noted above  our credit card business accounted for billion  or  of our total loan portfolio as of december   with domestic card accounting for billion  or  of our total loan portfolio as of december  based on our most recent data  we estimate that approximately one third of our domestic card portfolio had credit scores less than or no score  based on loan balances  as of december   relatively consistent with the proportion of the domestic card portfolio with credit scores below or no score as of december  for loans related to the us card acquisition and certain other partnerships  data is obtained on a lagged basis 
we present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio  including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
loans acquired as part of the ccb  ing direct and us card acquisitions are included in the denominator used in calculating the credit quality metrics presented below 
because some of these loans are accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected  which takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred  there are no charge offs or an allowance associated with these loans unless the estimated cash flows expected to be collected decrease subsequent to acquisition 
in addition  these loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming even though the customer may be contractually past due because we expect that we will fully collect the carrying value of these loans 
the accounting and classification of these loans may significantly alter some of our reported credit quality metrics 
we therefore supplement certain reported credit quality metrics with metrics adjusted to exclude the impact of these acquired loans 
delinquency rates we consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer s billing statement 
table compares day performing and total day delinquency rates  by loan category  as of december  and table also presents these metrics adjusted to exclude from the denominator acquired loans accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans 
our day delinquency metrics include all held for investment loans that are or more days past due  whereas our day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are or more days past due and that are also currently classified as performing and accruing interest 
the day delinquency and day performing delinquency metrics are generally the same for credit card loans  as we continue to classify the substantial majority of credit card loans as performing until the account is charged off  typically when the account is days past due

table summarizes loans that were days or more past due as to interest or principal and still accruing interest as of december   and these loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between days and days past due 
as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec  we generally continue to accrue interest on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge off  which is typically in the period the account becomes days past due 
while domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off  we establish a reserve for finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue

table of contents nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans  foreclosed property and repossessed assets 
nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
we do not report loans accounted for under the fair value option and loans held for sale as nonperforming

while the amount of nonperforming loans of billion as of december  was unchanged from december   the nonperforming loan ratio decreased to as of december   from as of december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the addition of the ing direct acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows  as well as the improvement in the credit quality of our commercial banking loans 
net charge offs net charge offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible  net of recovered amounts

loan modifications and restructurings as part of our customer retention efforts  we may modify loans for certain borrowers who have demonstrated performance under the previous terms 
as part of our loss mitigation efforts  we may make loan modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty that are intended to minimize our economic loss and avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral 
we may provide short term three to twelve months or long term greater than twelve months modifications to improve the long term collectability of the loan 
our most common types of modifications include a reduction in the borrower s initial monthly or quarterly principal and interest payment through an extension of the loan term  a reduction in the interest rate  or a combination of both 
these modifications may result in our receiving the full amount due  or certain installments due  under the loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the terms of the loan 
in some cases  we may curtail the amount of principal owed by the borrower 
loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are accounted for and reported as tdrs

table of contents credit card loan modifications have accounted for the majority of our tdr loan modifications  representing million  or  of the outstanding balance of total tdr loans as of december   and million  or  of the outstanding balance of total tdr loans as of december  the vast majority of our credit card tdr loan modifications involve a reduction in the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding months 
in some cases  the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non payment  late payment or similar events 
we determine the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment on modified loans that involve a reduction and are considered to be a tdr based on the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan entering the modification program 
in all cases  we cancel the customer s available line of credit on the credit card 
if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms  then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms  with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category 
the loan amount may then be charged off in accordance with our standard charge off policy 
home loan modifications represented million  or  of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of december   compared with million  or  of the outstanding balance of total modified loans as of december  the majority of our modified home loans involve a combination of an interest rate reduction  term extension or principal forbearance

we provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as tdrs  including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification  in note loans 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan 
loans defined as individually impaired  based on applicable accounting guidance  include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and tdr loans 
we do not report nonperforming consumer loans that have not been modified in a tdr as individually impaired  as we collectively evaluate these smaller balance homogenous loans for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
loans held for sale are also not reported as impaired  as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value 
impaired loans also exclude acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred  as discussed above under item selected financial data 
impaired loans  including tdrs  totaled billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  tdrs accounted for billion and billion of impaired loans as of december  and  respectively 
we provide additional information on our impaired loans  including the allowance established for these loans  in note loans and note allowance for loan and lease losses 

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we do not maintain an allowance for held for sale loans or acquired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge offs 
the provision for credit losses  which is charged to earnings  reflects loan and lease losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our charge offs 
charge offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added

as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the ffiec  our policy is generally not to classify domestic credit card loans as nonperforming 
we generally accrue interest on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge off  which is typically in the period that the loan becomes days past due 
the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans  excluding the allowance related to our credit card loans  was as of december  and as of december  
table of contents we increased our allowance by million in to billion as of december  the increase was primarily driven by the establishment of an initial allowance of billion related to the addition of the billion in outstanding receivables acquired in the us card acquisition that had existing revolving privileges at acquisition 
the allowance for these loans was calculated using the same methodology utilized for determining the allowance for our existing credit card loan portfolio 
on october   hurricane sandy made landfall on the new jersey coast  resulting in severe disaster in coastal counties in connecticut  new jersey and new york and varying degrees of damage and disruption in other northeast and mid atlantic states 
because we have significant consumer and commercial loan exposure in connecticut  new jersey and new york  the storm and its aftermath resulted in an elevated risk of loss for us within this region 
based on our assessment of the impact of hurricane sandy on our loan portfolio  we recorded an allowance of million as of december   which is included in our allowance for loan and lease losses of billion as of december  although the allowance increased in  the coverage ratio of the allowance to total loans held for investment fell by basis points to as of december   from as of december  the decrease in the allowance coverage ratio was largely due to the addition of loans acquired in the ing direct and us card acquisitions accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected 
as discussed above in item selected financial data  because the accounting for these loans takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred  there are no charge offs or an allowance associated with these loans unless the estimated cash flows expected to be collected decrease subsequent to acquisition

liquidity risk profile we have established liquidity guidelines that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets 
our guidelines include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our potential funding requirements and diversified funding sources to avoid over dependence on volatile  less reliable funding markets 
our liquidity reserves consist of cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered available for sale securities 
table below presents the fair value of our liquidity reserves as of december  and table liquidity reserves december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents investment securities available for sale less pledged investment securities available for sale unencumbered investment securities available for sale total liquidity reserves the weighted average life of our available for sale securities was approximately and years as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents our liquidity reserves increased by billion  or  in  to billion as of december  this increase reflected the addition of billion of investment securities available for sale from the ing direct acquisition  which was partially offset by the sale of billion of investment securities 
it also reflects an increase of billion in cash and cash equivalents  which includes higher cash held as of december  in anticipation of the january  redemption of the billion in trust preferred securities 
funding our funding objective is to establish an appropriate maturity profile using a cost effective mix of both short term and long term funds 
we use a variety of funding sources  including deposits  short term borrowings  the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings  and  to a lesser extent  loan securitization transactions 
in addition  we utilize fhlb advances  which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios  for our funding needs 
deposits our deposits provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds and are our largest source of funding

approximately billion and million of our total customer deposits were held in foreign banking offices as of december  and  respectively 
we have brokered deposits which we obtained through the use of third party intermediaries 
brokered deposits are included in money market deposit accounts and other consumer time deposits in table above 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of limits the use of brokered deposits to well capitalized insured depository institutions and  with a waiver from the federal deposit insurance corporation  to adequately capitalized institutions 
cobna and cona were well capitalized  as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines  as of december   and therefore permitted to maintain brokered deposits 
our brokered deposits totaled billion  or of total deposits  as of december  and billion  or of total deposits  as of december  we expect to replace maturing brokered deposits with new brokered deposits or other sources of funding  which may include branch or direct deposits 

table of contents table presents the contractual maturities of large denomination time deposits of  or more 
our funding and liquidity management activities factor into the expected maturities of these deposits 
based on past activity  we expect to retain a portion of these deposits as they mature

these borrowings are generally in the form of federal funds purchased and resale agreements 
in addition  we may utilize short term as well as long term fhlb advances for our funding needs 
fhlb advances are secured by certain of our loan portfolios and investment securities 
our short term borrowings typically have not represented a significant portion of our overall funding 
in the fourth quarter of  however  we significantly increased our short term fhlb advances in our portfolio to build our liquidity in anticipation of the redemption of the billion in outstanding trust preferred securities on january   as well as to cover seasonal loan growth and to fund increases in our investment securities

table of contents other funding sources we also access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the use of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase  the issuance of senior and subordinated notes  other borrowings  and loan securitization transactions 
in addition  we utilize advances from the fhlb for our funding needs 
fhlb advances are secured by certain of our loan portfolios and investment securities 
our debt  including federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase  senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings  such as fhlb advances  but excluding securitized debt obligations  totaled billion as of december   up from billion as of december  the billion increase in our debt  excluding securitized debt obligations  was primarily attributable to the proceeds of approximately billion from the issuance of senior notes  a billion increase in short term fhlb advances  as well as a decrease of million due to the maturity of one senior note 
we regularly participate in the federal funds market to take advantage of attractive offers and to keep a visible presence in the market  which is intended to ensure that we are able to access the federal funds market in a time of need 
we expect monthly fluctuations in our borrowings  as borrowing amounts are highly dependent on our counterparties cash positions

table of contents borrowing capacity we filed a new effective shelf registration statement with the sec on april   which will expire three years from the filing date  under which  from time to time  we may offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities  preferred stock  depository shares  common stock  purchase contracts  warrants and units 
there is no limit under this shelf registration statement to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell  subject to market conditions 
in addition to issuance capacity under the shelf registration statement  we also have access to fhlb advances and letters of credit with a maximum borrowing capacity of billion as of december  this borrowing capacity was secured by posting billion of loans and billion of securities as collateral 
we had billion outstanding as of december   and billion still available to us to borrow against under this program 
this funding source is non revolving and funding availability is subject to market conditions 
the ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the banks ability to post collateral 
our fhlb membership and borrowings are secured by our investment in fhlb stock  which totaled billion and as of december  and  respectively 
covenants the terms of certain lease and credit facility agreements related to other borrowings and operating leases include several financial covenants that require performance measures and equity ratios to be met 
if these covenants are not met  there may be an acceleration of the payment due dates noted in table as of december   we were not in default of any such covenants 
credit ratings our credit ratings have a significant impact on our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs 
rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors  including liquidity  capital adequacy  asset quality  quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support 
significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings 
such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs

market risk profile market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities  including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt and derivatives 
below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk  our market risk management strategies and measures used to evaluate our market risk exposure 
primary market risk exposures our primary sources of market risk include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk  which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the level or volatility of interest rates  is our most significant source of market risk exposure 
banks are inevitably exposed to interest 
table of contents rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities 
for example  if more assets are repricing than deposits and other borrowings when interest rates are declining  our earnings will decrease 
similarly  if more deposits and other borrowings are repricing than assets when interest rates are rising  our earnings will decrease 
interest rate risk also results from changes in customer behavior and competitors responses to changes in interest rates or other market conditions 
for example  decreases in mortgage rates generally result in faster than expected prepayments  which may adversely affect earnings 
increases in interest rates  coupled with strong demand from competitors for deposits  may influence industry pricing 
such competition may affect customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts  which may require replacing lower cost deposits with higher cost alternative sources of funding 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies 
the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency denominated loans and securities  future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions  foreign currency denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates  which may impact the earnings of our foreign operations 
we monitor and manage our material foreign currency denominated transactions and exposures through the use of derivatives to limit our earnings sensitivity exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the estimated reduction in our month earnings due to adverse foreign exchange rate movements corresponding to a probability was less than as of december  and the precision of this estimate is limited due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying forecast assumptions 
market risk management we employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk  which include  but are not limited to  changing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities 
derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
we execute our derivative contracts in both over the counter and exchange traded derivative markets 
although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps  we also use a variety of other derivative instruments  including caps  floors  options  futures and forward contracts  to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk 
the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  the decrease in the notional amount of our derivative contracts was primarily attributable to the termination of the ing direct related swap transactions that were executed to manage the anticipated impact of the ing direct acquisition on our market risk exposure and regulatory capital requirements 
from the date we entered into the agreement to acquire ing direct to early august  interest rates declined substantially  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the ing direct net assets and liabilities 
in order to capture some of the anticipated benefits to regulatory capital on the closing date attributable to this decline in interest rates  we entered into various interest rate swap transactions with a total notional principal amount of approximately billion 
these combined swap transactions were intended to mitigate the effect of a rise in interest rates on the fair values of a significant portion of the ing direct assets and liabilities during the period from when we entered into the swap transactions to the anticipated closing date of the ing direct acquisition in early in conjunction with our close of the ing direct acquisition on february   we terminated the ing direct related swap transactions 

table of contents market risk measurement we have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our asset liability management committee and approved by the finance committee of the board 
our objective is to manage our asset liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long term expectations 
because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk  we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure  assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings and the economic value of equity 
we consider the impact on both earnings and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk 
our earnings sensitivity measure estimates the impact on net interest income and the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights  including derivative hedging activity  resulting from movements in interest rates 
our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities  including derivative hedging activity  resulting from movements in interest rates 
our economic value of equity sensitivity measurements are based on our existing assets and liabilities  including derivatives  and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes 
the federal funds rate remained at a target range of zero to during given the level of short term rates as of december  and  a scenario where interest rates would decline by basis points is not plausible 
in  we temporarily revised our customary declining interest rate scenario of basis points to a basis point decrease  except in scenarios where a basis point decline would result in a rate less than in which case we assume a rate scenario of  to compensate for the continued low rate environment 
our current asset liability management policy also includes the use of derivatives to hedge material foreign currency denominated transactions to limit our earnings exposure to foreign exchange risk 
table shows the estimated percentage impact on our adjusted projected net interest income and economic value of equity  calculated under alternative hypothetical interest rate scenarios  as of december  and our adjusted projected net interest income consists of net interest income adjusted to include changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights  including related derivative hedging activity  and changes in the fair value of free standing interest rate swaps 
in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our adjusted projected net interest income  we assume a hypothetical gradual increase in interest rates of basis points and a hypothetical gradual decrease of basis points relative to implied forward rates over the next twelve months 
in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity  we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of plus basis points and minus basis points to spot rates 
we recently revised two assumptions used to calculate our earnings sensitivity measures 
first  in addition to our existing assets and liabilities  we now incorporate expected future business growth assumptions  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast 
second  we changed the interest rate scenario used to measure and evaluate the impact on the baseline forecast to assess our earnings sensitivity 
we previously measured our earnings sensitivity assuming a gradual plus or minus basis point change in forward rates 
our assumption is now based on an instantaneous plus or minus basis point shock as described above  with the lower rate scenario limited to zero 
we will continue to factor into our interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios  such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios  for all of sensitivity measures 
table includes our earnings sensitivity as of december  based on our revised methodology  as well as our previous methodology 
our revised methodology results in a slightly higher asset sensitivity position  which is attributable to a higher forecasted volume of rate sensitive assets versus rate sensitive liabilities and the impact of a more severe instantaneous shock 
we have not revised our methodology for measuring our economic value of equity sensitivities 
accordingly  the economic value sensitivity measures presented under our revised methodology are the same as those presented under our previous methodology

calculated excluding the impact of the interest rate swap transactions of approximately billion entered into to mitigate some of the interest rate risk related to the ing direct acquisition 
because of the large but temporary impact of the ing direct related swap transactions on our standard interest rate risk reporting measures  we expanded our standard interest rate sensitivity analysis to present our interest rate risk measures as of december  both with and without the impact of the billion of interest rate swaps described above 
this presentation highlights changes in our core interest rate risk profile and the incremental impact of the ing direct related swaps on our core profile over the time period that the swaps remained outstanding 
excluding the billion swap transactions  our interest rate sensitivity measures reflect that we became modestly more asset sensitive between december  and december  our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures  both including and excluding the impact of the ing direct related swap transactions  were within our prescribed asset liability policy limits as of december  and additionally  the new earnings sensitivity method results in a slightly higher asset sensitivity position compared to the previous method  resulting from a higher forecasted volume of rate sensitive assets versus rate sensitive liabilities in addition to the impact of an instantaneous rate shock 
limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information  internally developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies  which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments 
other market inputs  such as interest rates  market prices and interest rate volatility  are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures 
we regularly evaluate  update and enhance these assumptions  models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities 
there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the above sensitivity analyses contemplate only certain movements in interest rates and are performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and  in some cases  expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions 
the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ from our projections  which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ from the above sensitivity analyses

at closing  we acquired approximately million new active accounts  approximately billion in outstanding credit card receivables designated as held for investment and approximately million in other net assets 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued operations and business segments our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three primary business segments  which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking 
the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments 
the acquired ing direct business is primarily reflected in our consumer banking business  while the business acquired in the us card acquisition is reflected in our credit card business 
certain activities that are not part of a segment  such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset liability management by our centralized corporate treasury group  are included in the other category 
credit card consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending  national small business lending  national closed end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in canada and the united kingdom 
consumer banking consists of our branch based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses  national deposit gathering  national auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities 
commercial banking consists of our lending  deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers 
our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between million to billion 
in the first quarter of  we re aligned the loan categories reported by our commercial banking business and the loan product type included within each category 
the results of our individual businesses are reported on a continuing operations basis and prepared based on our internal management reporting process  which reflects the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources 
we provide the details on the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in note business segments 
basis of presentation and use of estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
while management makes its best judgment  actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of capital one financial corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest 
we determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
effective january   we prospectively adopted two accounting standards related to the transfer and servicing of financial assets and consolidations that changed how we account for securitized loans 
the adoption of these accounting standards resulted in the consolidation of substantially all of our securitization trusts 
we recorded an after tax charge to retained earnings on january  of billion for the net cumulative effect of adopting these accounting standards 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued voting interest entities voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that give them the power to make significant decisions relating to the entity s operations 
the usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest 
accordingly  we consolidate our majority owned subsidiaries and other voting interest entities in which we hold  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting rights or where we exercise control through other contractual rights 
investments in entities where we do not have a controlling financial interest but we have significant influence over the entity s financial and operating decisions generally defined as owning a voting interest of to are accounted for under the equity method 
if we own less than of a voting interest entity  we generally carry the investment at cost  except marketable equity securities  which we carry at fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we typically report investments accounted for under the equity or cost method in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  and include our share of income or loss in other non interest income in our consolidated statements of income 
variable interest entities vies vies are entities that  by design  either lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity s operations through voting rights  or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses  or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity 
the entity that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature  size and form of our involvement with the vie  such as our role in establishing the vie and our ongoing rights and responsibilities  our economic interests  including debt and equity investments  servicing fees  and other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the vie  the design of the vie  including the capitalization structure  subordination of interests  payment priority  relative share of interests held across various classes within the vie s capital structure and the reasons why the interests are held by us 
we perform on going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting interest framework have become vies  based on certain events  and are therefore subject to the vie consolidation framework and whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding our involvement with a vie result in a change in our consolidation conclusion 
our reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the vie through changes in governing documents or other circumstances 
the reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the vie  or whether an interest in the vie has become significant or is no longer significant 
the consolidation status of the vies with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments 
in the normal course of business  we enter into various types of transactions with entities that are considered to be vies 
our primary involvement with vies relates to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts 
see note variable interest entities and securitizations for further details 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest bearing deposits with banks  all of which  if applicable  have stated maturities of three months or less when acquired 
cash payments for interest expense totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash payments for income taxes totaled billion  million and million in  and  respectively 
securities resale and repurchase agreements securities purchased under resale agreements and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase  principally us government and agency obligations  are not accounted for as sales but as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold  plus accrued interest 
we receive securities purchased under agreements to resell and make delivery of securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
we continually monitor the market value of these securities and deliver or obtain additional collateral  as appropriate 
investment securities our investment securities consist primarily of fixed income debt securities and equity securities 
the accounting and measurement framework for our investment securities differs depending on the security classification 
we classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time and may sell prior to maturity in response to changes in our investment strategy  liquidity needs  interest rate risk profile or for other reasons are classified as available for sale 
securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains or losses  net of taxes  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost 
for most of our investment securities  interest income is recognized using the effective interest method 
deferred items  including unamortized premiums  discounts and other basis adjustments  are recognized in interest income over the contractual lives of the securities using the effective interest method 
we record purchases and sales of investment securities on a trade date basis 
realized gains and losses from the sale of debt securities are computed using the first in first out method of identification  and included in non interest income in our consolidated statements of income 
we regularly evaluate our securities whose value has declined below amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
amortized cost reflects historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums  accretion of discounts and other than temporary impairment write down 
we discuss our assessment of and accounting for other than temporary impairment in note investment securities 
we discuss the techniques we use in determining the fair value of our investment securities in note fair value of financial instruments 
loans our total loan portfolio consists of loans we own and loans underlying our securitization trusts 
our loan portfolio consists of credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking loans 
credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans as well as installment loans 
consumer banking loans consist of auto  
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued home  and retail banking loans 
commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate  commercial and industrial  and small ticket commercial real estate loans 
loan classification we classify loans as held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and management s assessment of our intent and ability to hold loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity 
management s intent and ability with respect to certain loans may change from time to time depending on a number of factors  including economic  liquidity and capital conditions 
the accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification and whether the loans are originated or purchased 
the accounting for purchased loans also differs depending on whether the loan is considered credit impaired at the date of acquisition 
we use the term acquired loans to refer to a limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the us card acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the chevy chase bank ccb and ing direct acquisitions  which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected 
we elect to account for all purchased loans using the guidance for accounting for purchased credit impaired loans  which is based upon expected cash flows  unless specifically scoped out of the guidance 
the classification criteria and accounting and measurement framework for loans held for investment  including loans purchased  and loans held for sale are described below 
loans held for investment loans that we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future and loans associated with on balance sheet securitization transactions accounted for as secured borrowings are classified as held for investment 
the substantial majority of our loans  which include unrestricted loans and restricted loans for securitization investors  are classified as held for investment 
loans classified as held for investment  except acquired loans accounted for based upon expected cash flows  are reported at amortized cost  which is measured based upon the outstanding unpaid principal balance  net of any unearned income  unamortized deferred fees and costs  unamortized premiums and discounts and charge offs 
credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees  net of the estimated uncollectible amount 
interest income is recognized on loans held for investment on an accrual basis 
we generally defer certain loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs on originated loans  premiums and discounts on purchased loans and loan commitment fees 
we recognize these amounts in interest income as yield adjustments over the life of the loan and or commitment period using the effective interest method 
for credit card loans  loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a month period 
we establish an allowance for loan losses for probable losses inherent in our held for investment loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
cash flows related to unrestricted loans held for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
because our securitization transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings  the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
loans held for sale loans that we intend to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale 
loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued value as determined on an aggregate homogeneous portfolio basis  with any write downs or recoveries in fair value up to the amortized cost recorded in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non interest income 
we recognize interest on loans held for sale on an accrual basis 
because loans held for sale are reported at lower of cost or fair value  an allowance for loan losses is not established for loans held for sale 
the fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based on secondary market prices for loan portfolios with similar characteristics 
we execute whole loan sales with either servicing rights released to the buyer or retained 
when loans are sold and the servicing rights are released to the buyer  the gain or loss recognized on the sale is calculated based on the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold 
when loans are sold and the servicing rights are retained  the fair value attributed to the retained servicing rights impacts the gain or loss recognized on the sale 
we report gains or losses on loans held for sale when realized in other non interest income 
we originated billion  million and billion of conforming residential mortgage loans in  and  respectively 
we retained servicing on approximately  and of the conforming residential mortgage loans we sold in  and  respectively  and recognized gains of million  million and million on the sale of held for sale loans in   and  respectively 
loan transfers in certain circumstances  we may transfer loans to from held for sale or held for investment based on a change in strategy 
we transfer these loans at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer and establish a new cost basis upon transfer 
if the decline in fair value upon transfer from held for investment to held for sale is related to credit  the change in value is recorded as a charge off at the time of transfer 
if the decline is related to other factors  the change in value is charged to non interest expense 
further declines in fair value will result in the establishment of a valuation allowance 
additionally  the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and direct loan origination fees ceases upon transfer 
loans acquired all purchased loans  including loans transferred in a business combination  acquired on or after january   are recorded at fair value as of the date of each acquisition 
accordingly  any related allowance for loan losses is not carried over 
we purchase loans with and without evidence of credit deterioration since origination 
subsequent to acquisition  we are required to account for purchased loans with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments based on expected cash flows 
we also may elect to account for other purchased loans based on expected cash flows 
loans acquired and accounted for based on expected cash flows in accounting for acquired loans based on expected cash flows  we first determine the contractually required payments due  which represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments  adjusted for the effect of estimated prepayments 
we then estimate the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect 
we incorporate several key assumptions to estimate cash flows expected to be collected  including default rates  loss severities and the amount and timing of prepayments 
we estimate the fair value by discounting the estimated cash flows we expect to collect using an observable market rate of interest  when available  adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value 
we are 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued permitted to aggregate loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools if the loans have common risk characteristics 
a pool is then accounted for as a single asset  with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flows 
the difference between the contractual payments on the loans and the expected cash flows  considering the impact of prepayments  represents the nonaccretable difference  or the amount not considered collectible 
the nonaccretable difference  which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans 
accordingly  there are no charge offs or an allowance associated with these loans unless the estimated cash flows expected to be collected decrease subsequent to acquisition 
these loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming even though the customer may be contractually past due because we expect that we will fully collect the carrying value of these loans 
in addition  even though substantially all of these loans are days or more contractually past due  they are considered to be accruing since we have a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected 
the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of acquired loans is referred to as the accretable yield 
this amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  but is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan  or pool of loans  using the effective interest method 
subsequent to acquisition  we are required to periodically evaluate our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
these evaluations  which we perform quarterly  require the use of key assumptions and estimates similar to those used in estimating the initial fair value at acquisition 
subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications from the nonaccretable yield to the accretable yield 
decreases in expected cash flows resulting from further credit deterioration will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
increases in the cash flows expected to be collected would first reduce any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition 
the excess over the recorded allowance for loan and lease losses would result in a reclassification to the accretable yield from the nonaccretable difference and an increase in interest income recognized over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans 
disposals of loans  which may include sales to third parties  receipt of payments in full or in part by the borrower  and foreclosure of the collateral  result in removal of the loan from the acquired loan portfolio 
see note acquisitions and note loans for additional information 
loans acquired and accounted for based on contractual cash flows the substantial majority of the loans purchased in the u 
s 
card acquisition had existing revolving privileges at acquisition and were therefore accounted for based on contractual cash flows 
to determine the fair value of these loans at acquisition  we discounted the contractual cash flows due using an observable market rate of interest  when available  adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value 
in determining fair value  contractual cash flows are adjusted to include prepayment estimates based upon trends in default rates and loss severities 
the difference between the fair value and the contractual cash flows is recorded as a loan discount or premium at acquisition 
the premium or discount is amortized into interest income using the effective interest method over the remaining life of the loans 
we are permitted to aggregate loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools if the loans have common risk characteristics 
a pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flows 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued subsequent to acquisition  it is necessary to record an allowance for loan and lease losses  through the provision for credit losses to properly recognize an estimate of incurred losses on the existing principal balances as of each reporting date 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated using the same methodology utilized for determining the allowance for our existing credit card portfolio prior to the us card acquisition  as described below under allowance for loan and lease losses 
loan modifications and restructurings as part of our loss mitigation efforts  we may make loan modifications that are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral 
we may provide short term three to twelve months or long term greater than twelve months modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long term collectability of the loan 
our modifications typically include a reduction in the borrower s initial monthly or quarterly principal and interest payment through an extension of the loan term  a reduction in the interest rate  or a combination of both 
for credit card loan agreements  such modifications may include canceling the customer s available line of credit on the credit card  reducing the interest rate on the card  and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding months 
these modifications may result in our receiving the full amount due  or certain installments due  under the modified loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the original loan 
in some cases  we may curtail the amount of principal owed by the borrower 
a loan modification in which a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is accounted for and reported as a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
we describe our accounting for and measurement of impairment on restructured loans below under impaired loans 
see note loans for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings 
delinquent and nonperforming loans the entire balance of a loan is considered contractually delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer s billing statement 
delinquency is reported on loans that are or more days past due 
interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status  if applicable 
we generally place loans on nonaccrual status when we believe the collectability of interest and principal is not reasonably assured 
nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
we do not report loans accounted for under the fair value option or loans held for sale as nonperforming 
our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming  by loan category  are as follows credit card loans as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec  our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes days past due 
consistent with industry conventions  we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged off 
when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of the credit card account by the estimated uncollectible portion of any billed finance charges and fees and exclude this amount from revenue 
during the fourth quarter  we began classifying credit card loans issued in the uk as nonperforming when the account becomes either or days past due 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued consumer banking loans we classify other non credit card consumer loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date when we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or in the period in which the loan becomes days past due for auto  home loans  and unsecured small business revolving lines of credit and days past due for all other non credit card consumer loans  including installment loans 
commercial banking loans we classify commercial loans as nonperforming as of the date we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured 
modified loans and troubled debt restructurings modified loans  including tdrs  that are current at the time of the restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected 
otherwise  the modified loan is classified as nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance over several payment cycles  generally six months of consecutive payments  under the modified terms of the loan 
acquired loans since the initial fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans  our subsequent accounting for acquired loans differs from the accounting for non acquired loans 
we therefore separately track and report acquired loans and exclude these loans from our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics 
interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended 
interest and fee income is subsequently recognized only upon the receipt of cash payments 
however  if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal  all cash received is applied against the principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan 
loans defined as individually impaired  based on applicable accounting guidance  include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and tdr loans 
we do not report consumer loans as impaired unless they have been modified in a tdr  as we collectively evaluate these smaller balance homogenous loans for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
loans held for sale are also not reported as impaired  as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value 
impaired loans also exclude acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows at initial acquisition because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred 
loans defined as individually impaired  based on applicable accounting guidance  include larger balance nonperforming loans and tdr loans 
our policies for identifying loans as individually impaired  by loan category  are as follows credit card loans credit card loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are identified and accounted for as individually impaired 
consumer banking loans consumer loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are identified and accounted for as individually impaired 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued commercial banking loans commercial loans classified as nonperforming and commercial loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are generally reported as individually impaired 
acquired loans we track and report acquired loans separately from other impaired loans 
the majority of individually impaired loans are evaluated for an asset specific allowance 
once a loan is modified in a troubled debt restructuring  the loan is generally considered impaired until maturity regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms 
although the loan may be returned to accrual status if the criteria above under delinquent and nonperforming loans are met  the loan would continue to be evaluated for an asset specific allowance for loan and lease losses and we would continue to report the loan as impaired 
we generally measure impairment and the related asset specific allowance for individually impaired loans based on the difference between the recorded investment of the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows  discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan at the time of modification 
if the loan is collateral dependent  we measure impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral  which we determine based on the current fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
loans are identified as collateral dependent if we believe that collateral is the sole source of repayment 
if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment  we recognize impairment through a direct write down of the loan  by establishing an allowance for the loan or by adjusting the allowance for the impaired loan 
see note allowance for loan and lease losses for additional information on the asset specific component of our allowance 
charge offs net charge offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible  net of recovered amounts 
we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge offs 
charge offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
costs incurred to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non interest expense 
our charge off time frame for loans  which varies based on the loan type  is presented below 
credit card loans we generally charge off credit card loans when the account is days past due from the statement cycle date 
during the fourth quarter  we began charging off delinquent credit card loans for which revolving privileges have been revoked as part of a closed end loan workout when the account becomes days past due 
credit card loans in bankruptcy are charged off within days of receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court 
credit card loans of deceased account holders are charged off within days of receipt of notification 
consumer banking loans we generally charge off consumer loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral 
our charge off time frame is days for home loans and unsecured small business lines of credit and days for auto and other non credit card consumer loans 
we calculate the charge off amount for home loans based on the excess of our recorded investment in the loan over the fair value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs as of the date of the charge off 
we update our home value estimates on a regular basis and recognize additional charge offs for declines in home values below our initial fair value less selling cost estimate at the date home loans are charged off 
consumer loans in bankruptcy  except for auto and home loans  generally are charged off within days of receipt of notification from the bankruptcy 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued court 
auto and home loans in bankruptcy are charged off in the period that the loan is both days or more past due and days or more past the bankruptcy notification date or in the period the loan becomes days past due for auto loans and days past due for home loans regardless of the bankruptcy notification date 
consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged off within days of receipt of notification 
commercial banking loans we charge off commercial loans in the period we determine that the unpaid principal loan amounts are uncollectible 
acquired loans we do not record charge offs on acquired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component 
we record charge offs on impaired loans only if actual losses exceed estimated losses incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition 
allowance for loan and lease losses we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance that represents management s best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we do not maintain an allowance for held for sale loans or acquired loans  which includes purchased credit impaired loans  accounted for based upon expected cash flows that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations  as the fair value of these loans recorded at acquisition takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred 
the allowance is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge offs 
the provision for credit losses  which is charged to earnings  reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our charge offs 
charge offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added back 
management performs a quarterly analysis of our loan portfolio to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses 
we apply documented systematic methodologies to separately calculate the allowance for our consumer loan and commercial loan portfolios and for loans within each of these portfolios that we identify as individually impaired 
our allowance for loan and lease losses consists of three components that are allocated to cover the estimated probable losses in each loan portfolio based on the results of our detailed review and loan impairment assessment process a component for loans collectively evaluated for impairment  an asset specific component for individually impaired loans  and a component related to acquired loans that have experienced significant decreases in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition 
each of our allowance components is supplemented by an amount that represents management s qualitative judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance 
management s judgment involves an assessment of subjective factors  such as process risk  modeling assumption and adjustment risks and probable internal and external events that will likely impact losses 
our consumer loan portfolio consists of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  divided into four primary portfolio segments credit card loans  auto loans  residential home loans and retail banking loans 
each of these portfolios is further divided by our business units into pools based on common risk characteristics  such as origination year  contract type  interest rate and geography  which are collectively evaluated for impairment 
the commercial loan portfolio is primarily composed of larger balance  non homogeneous loans 
these loans are subject to individual reviews that result in internal risk ratings 
in assessing the risk rating of a particular loan  among the factors we consider are the financial condition of the borrower  geography  collateral performance  historical loss experience  and industry specific information that management believes is relevant in determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
these factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information  and involve subjective assessment and interpretation 
emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned to that loan 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued the component of the allowance for credit card and other consumer loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on a statistical calculation  which is supplemented by management judgment as described above 
because of the homogenous nature of our consumer loan portfolios  the allowance is based on the aggregated portfolio segment evaluations 
the allowance is established through a process that begins with estimates of incurred losses in each pool based upon various statistical analyses 
loss forecast models are utilized to estimate incurred losses and consider several portfolio indicators including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  account seasoning  the value of collateral underlying secured loans  estimated foreclosures or defaults based on observable trends  delinquencies  bankruptcy filings  unemployment  credit bureau scores and general economic and business trends 
management believes these factors are relevant in estimating incurred losses and also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on indicators such as changes in our credit evaluation  underwriting and collection management policies  changes in the legal and regulatory environment  general economic conditions and business trends and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance 
we update our consumer loss forecast models and portfolio indicators on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment 
the component of the allowance for commercial loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on our historical loss experience for loans with similar risk characteristics and consideration of the current credit quality of the portfolio  which is supplemented by management judgment as described above 
we apply internal risk ratings to commercial loans  which we use to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate based on an estimated probability of default default rate and loss given default loss severity 
we generally use the prior three year actual portfolio credit loss experience to develop our estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
management may also apply judgment to adjust the loss factors derived  taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors  including general economic conditions  specific industry and geographic trends  portfolio concentrations  trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates 
the asset specific component of the allowance covers smaller balance homogenous credit card and other consumer loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr and larger balance nonperforming  non homogenous commercial loans 
as discussed above under impaired loans  we generally measure the asset specific component of the allowance based on the difference between the recorded investment of individually impaired loans and the present value of expected future cash flows 
when the present value is lower than the carrying value of the loan  impairment is recognized through the provision for credit losses 
if the loan is collateral dependent  we measure impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral  which we determine based on the current fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
the asset specific component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets 
the asset specific component of the allowance for larger balance commercial loans is individually calculated for each loan 
key considerations in determining the allowance include the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment history  prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors  and when applicable  the estimated realizable value of any collateral 
we record purchased loans at fair value at acquisition 
applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for impaired loans acquired in a transfer 
subsequent to acquisition  decreases in expected principal cash flows of acquired loans would trigger the recognition of impairment through our provision for credit losses 
subsequent increases in expected cash flows would first result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses  to the extent applicable  and then increase the accretable yield 
write downs on purchased impaired loans in excess of the nonaccretable difference are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
see note loans for information on loan portfolios associated with acquisitions 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses  we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and financial guarantees  and binding unfunded loan commitments 
the provision for unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses on our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
we assess these risk classifications  in conjunction with historical loss experience  utilization assumptions  current economic conditions  performance trends within specific portfolio segments and other pertinent information to estimate the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of the factors then prevailing  may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments in future periods 
securitization of loans we primarily securitize credit card loans  auto loans and home loans 
securitizations have historically been utilized for liquidity and funding purposes 
see note variable interest entities and securitizations for additional details 
loan securitization involves the transfer of a pool of loan receivables from our portfolio to a trust from which the trust sells an undivided interest in the pool of loan receivables to third party investors through the issuance of debt securities 
the debt securities are collateralized by the transferred receivables from our portfolio  and we receive proceeds from the third party investors in consideration for the loans transferred 
we remove loans from our consolidated balance sheet when securitizations qualify as sales to non consolidated vies  recognize assets retained and liabilities assumed at fair value and record a gain or loss on the transferred loans 
alternatively  when the transfer does not qualify as a sale but instead is considered a secured borrowing or when the sale is to a consolidated vie  the asset will remain on our consolidated financial statements with an offsetting liability recognized for the amount of proceeds received 
premises and equipment land is carried at cost 
properties and equipment  including leasehold improvements  are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we capitalize direct costs including external costs for purchased software  contractors  consultants and internal staff costs for internally developed software projects that have been identified as being in the application development stage 
depreciation and amortization expenses are computed generally by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives for premises and equipment are estimated as follows premises equipment useful lives buildings and improvement years furniture and equipment years computers and software years leasehold improvements lesser of useful life or the remaining fixed non cancelable lease term expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred 
gains or losses upon disposition are reflected in earnings as realized 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with accounting guidance  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is at the operating segment level or one level below an operating segment 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances change  such as adverse changes in the business climate  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units at the date of acquisition 
our reporting units are domestic credit card  international credit card  auto finance  other consumer banking and commercial banking 
the goodwill impairment test  performed at october of each year  is a two step test 
the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our consolidated balance sheets 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized either on a straight line or on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets for additional detail 
foreclosed property and repossessed assets foreclosed property and repossessed assets are comprised of any asset or property acquired through loan restructurings  workouts  foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
acquired property may include commercial and residential real estate properties or personal property  such as autos 
upon repossession of property obtained in satisfaction of a loan  we reclassify the loan to repossessed assets and record the acquired property at the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs 
we estimate fair values primarily based on appraisals  when available 
we regularly evaluate the fair value of acquired property and subsequently record adjustments to reflect the property at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition or the current fair value less estimated selling costs 
any valuation adjustments on acquired property and any gains or losses realized from disposition of the property are reflected in non interest expense 
foreclosed property and repossessed assets  which we report in our consolidated balance sheet under other assets  totaled million and million  respectively  as of december   compared with million and million  respectively  as of december  restricted equity investments we had investments in federal home loan bank fhlb stock  which totaled billion and million as of december  and  respectively  and our investment in federal reserve stock  which totaled billion and million  as of december  and  respectively 
these investments  which are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets  deemed restricted and are carried at cost 
we assess these investments for other than temporary impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for evaluating impairment 
we did not recognize any impairment on these investments in or representation and warranty reserve in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan  indemnify the investor or insurer  or reimburse the investor for loan and lease losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors  depending on the category of purchaser and rely on historical data 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 
losses incurred on loans that we are required to either repurchase or make payments to the investor under the indemnification provisions are charged against the representation and warranty reserve 
the representation and warranty reserve is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes to the representation and warranty reserve related to greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees for additional information related to our representation and warranty reserve 
customer rewards reserve we offer products  primarily credit cards  which include programs that allow members to earn rewards  such as cash  airline tickets or merchandise  based on account activity 
customer rewards costs are generally recorded as an offset to interchange income when the rewards are earned by the customer and record the corresponding customer rewards reserve 
the customer rewards reserve is computed based on estimated future cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed and the average cost per point redeemed 
the customer rewards reserve is reduced as points are redeemed 
in estimating the customer rewards reserve  we consider historical rewards redemption behavior  the terms of the current rewards programs and card purchase activity 
the customer rewards reserve is sensitive to changes in the reward redemption type and redemption rate  which is based on the expectation that the vast majority of all points earned will eventually be redeemed 
the customer rewards reserve  which is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
revenue recognition interest income and fees we recognize interest income  including finance charges  and fees on loans in interest and non interest income in our consolidated statements of income in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements 
loan origination fees and costs and premiums and discounts are generally deferred and amortized over the average life of the related loans using the effective interest method  except for credit card  which are amortized over one year on a straight line basis 
direct loan origination costs consist of both internal and external costs associated with the origination of a loan 
as discussed above under loans delinquent and nonperforming loans  interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status  if applicable 
interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued finance charges and fees on credit card loans  except for annual membership fees  are included in loan receivables when the amounts are billed to the customer 
annual membership fees are deferred and amortized into income over one year on a straight line basis 
we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off 
however  when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue 
our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables 
revenue was reduced by million  million and million in  and  respectively  for the estimated uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees 
the finance charge and fee reserve totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  interchange income interchange income represents merchant fees for credit card transactions processed through the interchange network due to the customer s card issuing bank  which is net of the fee retained by the merchant s processing bank 
the levels and structure of interchange rates are set by mastercard international inc mastercard and visa usa inc visa and are based on cardholder purchase volumes 
we recognize interchange income as earned at the time of purchase 
same as cash promotions as part of certain retail partnership agreements  we offer borrowers a same as cash sac promotional period 
sac programs generally require a minimum monthly payment during the promotional period 
as part of a sac promotional program  a borrower has a period of time  typically ranging from six months to three years  to pay the principal balance in full 
if the borrower pays the principal balance in full before the expiration date of the sac promotional period  the borrower is not subject to any interest 
if the borrower does not pay the principal balance in full prior to the expiration date of the sac promotional period  interest charges are applied retroactive to the purchase date 
we accrue sac interest income on a monthly basis throughout the term of the sac period based on the amount we expect to collect 
accordingly  we do not accrue interest income for borrowers who we expect will pay their principal balance in full prior to the expiration of the sac period or for borrowers who we expect will be unable to pay the full amount 
card partnership agreements our partnership agreements relate to alliances with retailers and other partners to provide lending and other services to mutual customers 
we primarily issue private label and co branded credit card loans to these customers over the term of these arrangements  which typically range from two to ten years 
certain partners assist in or perform marketing activities on our behalf and promote our products and services to their customers 
as compensation for providing these services  we often pay royalties  bounties  or other special bonuses to these partners 
depending upon the nature of the payments  they are recorded as a reduction of revenue  marketing expenses or other operating expenses 
if a partnership agreement provides for profit  revenue or loss sharing payments  we must determine whether to report those payments on a gross or net basis in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate the 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued contractual provisions of each transaction and applicable accounting guidance to determine the manner in which to report the impact of shared payment provisions in our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated net income is the same regardless of whether revenue and loss sharing arrangements are reported on a gross or net basis 
collaborative arrangements a collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity between two or more parties that are active participants in the activity 
these parties are exposed to significant risks and rewards based upon the economic success of the joint operating activity 
we assess each of our partnership agreements with profit  revenue or loss sharing payments to determine if a collaborative arrangement exists and  if so  how revenue generated from third parties  costs incurred and transactions between participants in the collaborative arrangement should be accounted for and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we acquired kohl s department stores kohl s existing private label credit card loan portfolio from jpmorgan chase co 
pursuant to a partnership agreement we entered into in august with kohl s 
the existing portfolio  which consisted of more than million kohl s customer accounts  had an outstanding principal and interest balance of approximately billion at acquisition 
the partnership agreement has an initial seven year term and an automatic one year renewal thereafter 
we accounted for the purchase as an asset acquisition 
under the terms of the partnership agreement and in conjunction with the acquisition  we began issuing kohl s branded private label credit cards to new and existing kohl s customers on april  risk management decisions are jointly managed by kohl s and us  but we retain final authority over risk management decisions 
kohl s has primary responsibility for handling customer service functions and advertising and marketing related to credit card customers 
based on our assessment  we determined that the kohl s partnership agreement meets the definition of a collaborative arrangement 
none of our other partnership agreements are considered to be collaborative arrangements 
we share a fixed percentage of revenues  consisting of finance charges and late fees  with kohl s  and kohl s is required to reimburse us for a fixed percentage of credit losses incurred 
revenues and losses related to the kohl s credit card program and partnership agreement are reported on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements 
revenue sharing amounts attributable to kohl s are recorded as an offset against total net revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
the loss sharing amounts due from kohl s are recorded as a reduction in our provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to the kohl s portfolio is reduced by the loss sharing amount due from kohl s 
interest income was reduced by million and million in and  respectively  for amounts earned by kohl s as part of the revenue sharing agreement 
loss sharing amounts attributable to kohl s reduced charge offs by million and million in and  respectively 
the reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses attributable to kohl s was million and million in and  respectively 
the expected reimbursement from kohl s  which is netted against our allowance for loan and lease losses  was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued stock based compensation we reserve common shares for issuance to employees  directors and third party service providers  in various forms  including incentive stock options  nonstatutory stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock awards and units and performance share awards and units 
in addition  we also issue cash equity units and cash settled restricted stock units which are not counted against the common shares reserved for issuance or available for issuance because they are settled in cash 
we generally recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the award s service period  however  we recognize compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method when the award contains a performance condition with graded vesting 
in addition  our cash equity units and cash settled restricted stock units are accounted for as liability awards pursuant to which the expense fluctuates with changes in our stock price until the awards are settled 
awards that continue to vest after retirement are expensed over the shorter of the period of time between the grant date and the final vesting period or between the grant date and when the participant becomes retirement eligible  awards to participants who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to immediate expensing upon grant 
compensation expense is included in salaries and associate benefits on the consolidated statements of income 
stock based compensation expense for stock options is based on fair value  which is estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock options  the expected volatility of our common stock price and our expected dividend yield 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the number of options that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or if there is a change in key assumptions  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
generally  the fair value of restricted stock awards and units  performance share awards and units  cash equity units and cash settled restricted stock units will equal the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in addition  prior to vesting  the compensation expense related to cash settled restricted stock units is adjusted quarterly for any change in fair value based on changes in our common stock price 
upon vesting of the cash settled restricted stock units  compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the actual cash payment  which is based upon the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the trading days preceding the vesting date or the closing price on vesting date 
marketing expense we expense marketing costs as incurred 
television advertising costs are expensed during the period in which the advertisements are aired 
we recognized marketing expense of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
fraud losses we experience fraud losses from the unauthorized use of credit cards  debit cards and customer bank accounts 
additional fraud losses may be incurred when loans are obtained through fraudulent means 
transactions suspected of being fraudulent are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non interest expense after the investigation period has completed 
recoveries of fraud losses are also included in non interest expense 
see note other non interest expense for additional information 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes  recognizing the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
see note income taxes for additional detail 
earnings per share earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income  after deducting dividends on preferred stock and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities  by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period  net of any treasury shares 
we calculate diluted earnings per share by dividing net income  after deducting dividends on preferred stock and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities  by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period  net of any treasury shares  after consideration of the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents for example  stock options  restricted stock awards and units and performance share awards and units 
common stock equivalents are calculated based upon the treasury stock method using an average market price of common shares sold during the period 
dilution is not considered when the company is in a net loss position 
common stock equivalents that have an antidilutive effect are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share 
we have unvested share based payment awards which have a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
these share based payment awards are deemed to be participating securities 
as a result  earnings per share is calculated under the two class method 
the two class method is an earnings allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period 
derivative instruments and hedging activities all derivative financial instruments  whether designated for hedge accounting or not  are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities 
we report derivatives in a gain position  or derivative assets  in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets 
we report derivatives in a loss position  or derivative liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities 
we report derivative asset and liability amounts on a gross basis based on individual contracts  which does not take into consideration the effects of master counterparty netting agreements or collateral netting 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities for additional detail on the accounting for derivative instruments  including those designated as a qualifying accounting hedge 
fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
the fair value accounting guidance provides a three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments 
this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level unobservable inputs the accounting guidance for fair value requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value 
accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect  on a contract by contract basis  to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value into earnings 
we have not made any material fair value option elections as of and for the years ended december  and see note fair value of financial instruments for additional information 
accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations 
under the guidance for business combinations  the accounting differs depending on whether the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business 
a business is considered to be an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing economic benefits directly to investors or other owners  members  or participants 
if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business  the transaction is accounted for as a business combination 
otherwise  it is accounted for as an asset acquisition 
in a business combination  identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date  with limited exceptions 
transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are generally expensed as incurred 
goodwill is recognized as the excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
likewise  if the fair value of the net assets acquired is greater than the acquisition price  a bargain purchase gain is recognized and recorded in non interest income 
the operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of the merger or acquisition 
in an asset acquisition  the assets acquired are recorded at the purchase price plus any transaction costs incurred 
goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition 
accounting standards adopted in subsequent accounting for an indemnification asset recognized at the acquisition date as a result of a government assisted acquisition of a financial institution in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance explaining how to account for the subsequent decrease in cash flows associated with an indemnification asset arising from a government assisted acquisition of a financial institution 
although we have not participated in a government assisted acquisition  we have applied this guidance  by analogy  to indemnification assets recognized in conjunction with other business combinations 
the guidance explains that any subsequent decrease in cash flows associated with an indemnification asset should be amortized over the shorter of the life of the covered loans or 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued the remaining contractual life of the indemnification agreement 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  the guidance will be applied prospectively to existing indemnification assets as well as to those that arise from future business combinations 
we elected to early adopt the guidance and began amortizing the decrease in cash flows associated with existing indemnification assets as of december  goodwill impairment in september  the fasb issued guidance that is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by providing entities with the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative analysis currently required 
if an entity chooses to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
otherwise  goodwill is deemed to be not impaired and no further analysis would be necessary 
the amended goodwill impairment guidance does not affect the manner in which a company estimates fair value 
the amended guidance was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the amended guidance on january  we had billion in goodwill as of december   the value of which was not affected by the adoption of this standard 
presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that revises the manner in which comprehensive income is required to be presented in financial statements 
the new guidance requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
the guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
it does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
the guidance requires retrospective application and was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we adopted the guidance in the first quarter of and elected to present other comprehensive income in a separate statement immediately following our consolidated statements of income 
our adoption of the guidance had no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity since it impacts presentation only 
fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs in may  the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value that is intended to provide a converged fair value framework for us gaap and ifrs 
while the amended guidance continues to define fair value as an exit price  it changes some fair value measurement principles and expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the amended guidance was effective for public entities during interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the new guidance requires prospective application and disclosure in the period of adoption of the change  if any  in valuation techniques and related inputs resulting from application of the amendments and quantification of the total effect  if practicable 
we adopted the amended guidance in the first quarter of the change in fair value measurement principles did not result in any changes to the fair value of our assets or liabilities carried at fair value and thus  had no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the new disclosures required by the amended guidance are included in note fair value of financial instruments 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued transfers and servicing reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements in april  the fasb issued an amendment to the guidance for transfers and servicing with regard to repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity 
this amendment removes the criterion related to collateral maintenance from the transferor s assessment of effective control 
it focuses the assessment of effective control on the transferor s rights and obligations with respect to the transferred financial assets and not on whether the transferor has the practical ability to perform in accordance with those rights or obligations 
our adoption of the amended guidance on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
issued but not yet adopted accounting standards comprehensive income reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued new guidance requiring an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the new guidance does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
the information must be presented either on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or in the notes 
the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  our adoption of the guidance on january  will have no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity since it impacts disclosures only 
offsetting financial assets and liabilities in december  the fasb issued guidance intended to enhance current disclosure requirements on offsetting financial assets and liabilities 
the new disclosures will enable financial statement users to compare balance sheets prepared under us gaap and ifrs  which are subject to different offsetting models 
upon adoption  entities will be required to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the disclosures will be required irrespective of whether such instruments are presented gross or net on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after january   with comparative retrospective disclosures required for all periods presented 
our adoption of the guidance will have no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity since it impacts disclosures only 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued note acquisitions we regularly explore opportunities to enter into strategic partnership agreements or acquire financial services companies and businesses to expand our distribution channels and grow our customer base 
we may structure these transactions with both an initial payment and subsequent contingent payments tied to future financial performance 
in some partnership agreements  we may enter into collaborative risk sharing arrangements that provide for revenue and loss sharing 
acquisitions ing direct on june   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the ing sellers  under which we would acquire ing direct 
on february   we closed the acquisition of ing direct  which included i the acquisition of all the equity interests of ing bank  fsb ii the acquisition of all equity interests of each of ws realty llc and ing direct community development llc and iii the acquisition of certain other assets and the assumption of certain other liabilities of ing direct bancorp 
headquartered in wilmington  delaware  ing direct was the largest direct bank in the united states 
the ing direct acquisition strengthened our customer franchise and added over seven million customers and approximately billion in deposits to our consumer banking segment 
the aggregate consideration paid by us in the ing direct acquisition was approximately billion in cash and  shares of capital one common stock with a fair value of approximately billion as of the acquisition date 
we used current liquidity sources as well as proceeds from public debt and equity offerings described below to fund the cash consideration 
in the third quarter of  we closed a public offering of four different series of our senior notes for total cash proceeds of approximately billion and a public underwritten offering of million shares of our common stock  subject to forward sale agreements 
we settled the forward sale agreements entirely by physical delivery of shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds from the forward purchasers of approximately billion on february  we also incurred transaction costs related to the ing direct acquisition totaling million as of december   of which million was recognized in and reported in our consolidated statement of income as a component of non interest expense 
these transaction costs do not include other merger related expenses  such as integration costs 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued accounting for ing direct acquisition the ing direct acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting  which requires  among other things  that we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
the following table summarizes our allocation of the ing direct acquisition purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the cash and non cash consideration included in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
dollars in millions fair value purchase price cash fair value of capital one common stock issued as non cash consideration  shares aggregate consideration transferred allocation of purchase price to net assets acquired assets cash and due from banks investments loans held for investment loans held for sale premises and equipment accrued interest receivable identifiable intangible assets other assets total assets liabilities interest payable interest bearing deposits other borrowings other liabilities total liabilities net assets acquired bargain purchase gain includes million of accrued interest receivable attributable to loans held for investment 
other assets include million of deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance of million  as of the acquisition date 
other liabilities include million of deferred tax liabilities as of the acquisition date 
at acquisition  the fair value of the net assets acquired from ing direct of billion exceeded the purchase price of billion  resulting in the recognition of a bargain purchase gain of million  which was reported as a component of non interest income on our consolidated statement of income for the first quarter of a substantial portion of the assets acquired from ing direct were mortgage related assets  which generally decrease in value as interest rates rise and increase in value as interest rates fall 
the bargain purchase gain was driven largely by a substantial decline in long term interest rates between the period shortly after our announcement of the ing direct acquisition and its closing  which resulted in an increase in the fair value of the acquired mortgage assets and the overall net fair value of assets acquired 
further  the purchase and sale agreement did not include a mechanism to adjust the purchase price to reflect the increase to the fair value of the net assets acquired 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued us card acquisition on may   we completed the previously announced acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities of the credit card and private label credit card business in the united states other than the hsbc bank usa  national association consumer credit card program and certain other retained assets and liabilities of hsbc finance corporation  hsbc usa inc and hsbc technology services usa inc 
collectively  the hsbc sellers  pursuant to the purchase and assumption agreement  dated as of august  by and among capital one and each of the hsbc sellers the us card acquisition 
we acquired approximately billion of outstanding credit card receivables as well as million in other net assets in exchange for consideration of approximately billion in cash to the hsbc sellers  net of a million receivable 
we financed the acquisition through a combination of existing cash  cash acquired from the ing direct acquisition  the sale of securities held as available for sale  as well as the public debt and equity offerings described below 
the us card acquisition enhanced the existing franchise and scale in the domestic card business and accelerated our achievement of a leading position in retail credit card partnerships 
in the first quarter of  we closed a public offering of  shares of our common stock which we sold to the underwriters at a per share price of for net proceeds of approximately billion 
in addition  we issued billion of our senior notes due in a public offering which also closed in the first quarter for net proceeds of approximately billion 
direct costs of approximately million paid to third parties in connection with this debt issuance were capitalized as deferred charges in the balance sheet and are amortized over the term of the debt as a component of interest expense using the effective interest method 
we also incurred transaction costs related to the us card acquisition totaling million as of december  of which all but million was recognized and reported in our consolidated statement of income as a component of non interest expense 
these costs do not include other merger related expenses such as integration costs 
accounting for the us card acquisition the us card acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting  which requires  among other things  that we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
the following table summarizes the final accounting for the us card acquisition  which is based on fair value assessments recorded in the second quarter along with fair value adjustments recorded during the measurement period 
adjustments recorded through the end of the measurement period on september  resulted in the following a million decrease in other assets  a net decrease of million in intangible assets and a net million increase in other liabilities 
together  these adjustments resulted in an increase of million to the preliminary goodwill recognized as of the acquisition date 
as presented below  the purchase price of assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of these items and resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill which was assigned to our credit card segment 
goodwill resulted from expertise gained through an enhanced retail partnership business as well as economies of scale obtained through infrastructure enhancements and additions to our current staff 
for tax reporting purposes  the us card acquisition was treated as a taxable purchase of assets 
as such  the total amount of goodwill recognized is amortizable for tax purposes over years

yields of tax exempt securities are calculated on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis 
other than temporary impairment we evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position at least quarterly  and more often as market conditions require  to assess whether the impairment is other than temporary 
our otti assessment is a subjective process requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
accordingly  we consider a number of qualitative and quantitative criteria in our assessment  including the extent and duration of the impairment  recent events specific to the issuer and or industry to which the issuer belongs  the payment structure of the security  external credit ratings and the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments  the value of underlying collateral  our intent and ability to hold the security  and current market conditions 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued we assess  measure and recognize otti in accordance with the accounting guidance for recognition and presentation of otti 
under this guidance  if we determine that impairment on our debt securities is other than temporary and we have made the decision to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  we recognize the entire portion of the impairment in earnings 
if we have not made a decision to sell the security and we do not expect that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis  we recognize only the credit component of otti in earnings 
the remaining unrealized loss due to factors other than credit  or the non credit component  is recorded in aoci 
we determine the credit component based on the difference between the security s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows  discounted based on the effective yield 
the non credit component represents the difference between the security s fair value and the present value of expected future cash flows 
the following table summarizes other than temporary impairment losses on debt securities recognized in earnings for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in millions total otti losses portion of other than temporary losses recorded in aoci net otti losses recognized in earnings we recognized million of otti losses in earnings for securities sold during in  based on our ongoing otti assessments  we determined that the projected cash flows on certain acquired investment securities were less than their initial fair value at acquisition and the difference was therefore recognized in earnings 
as indicated in the table above  we recorded net otti in earnings totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the cumulative non credit related portion of otti on these securities recorded in aoci totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we estimate the portion of losses attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model and we estimate the expected cash flows from the underlying collateral using industry standard third party modeling tools 
these tools take into consideration security specific delinquencies  product specific delinquency roll rates and expected severities 
key assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows include default rates  loss severity and prepayment rates 
assumptions used can vary widely based on the collateral underlying the securities and are influenced by factors such as collateral type  loan interest rate  geographical location of the borrower  and borrower characteristics 
we believe the gross unrealized losses related to securities for which we have not recognized an otti on of million and million as of december  and  respectively  are attributable to issuer specific credit spreads and changes in market interest rates and asset spreads 
therefore  we currently do not expect to incur credit losses related to these securities 
in addition  we have no intent to sell these securities with unrealized losses and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost 
accordingly  we have concluded that the impairment on these securities is not other than temporary

we concluded that certain of these securities  which had an estimated fair value of billion and contractually required principal and interest payments of billion at acquisition  were credit impaired because there was evidence of credit deterioration and it was probable that we would not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments due 
in accounting for acquired credit impaired debt securities  we first determine the contractually required payments due  which represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments  adjusted for the effect of estimated prepayments 
we then estimate the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect 
the difference between the contractually required payments due and the cash flows we expect to collect at 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued acquisition  considering the impact of prepayments  is referred to as the nonaccretable difference 
the nonaccretable difference  which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  reflects estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the security 
the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of credit impaired debt securities at acquisition is referred to as the accretable yield  which is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the security using the effective interest method 
subsequent to acquisition  we complete quarterly evaluations of expected cash flows 
decreases in expected cash flows attributable to credit result in the recognition of other than temporary impairment 
increases in expected cash flows are recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the security as an adjustment to the accretable yield 
in accounting for the acquired investments in debt securities that we did not consider to be credit impaired at acquisition  any premium or discount at acquisition is recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the effective interest method

note loans loan portfolio composition our total loan portfolio consists of loans we own and loans underlying our securitization trusts 
our loan portfolio consists of credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking loans 
credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans as well as installment loans 
consumer banking loans consist of auto  home  and retail banking loans 
commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate  commercial and industrial  and small ticket commercial real estate loans 
loans acquired in business acquisitions our portfolio of loans held for investment includes loans acquired in the ccb  ing direct and us card acquisitions 
these loans were recorded at fair value as of the date of each acquisition 
acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows we use the term acquired loans to refer to a limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the us card acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ing direct and ccb acquisitions  which are accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected 
acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected was billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  the increase was largely due to the acquired loans from the ing direct acquisition 
we regularly update our estimate of the amount of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results on an aggregated pool basis for loans with common risk characteristics 
probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through our provision for credit losses 
probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition  with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans 
we increased the allowance and recorded a provision for credit losses of 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued million for year ended december  related to certain pools of acquired loans 
the cumulative impairment recognized on acquired loans totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the credit performance of the remaining pools has generally been in line with our expectations  and  in some cases  more favorable than expected  which has resulted in the reclassification of amounts from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield 
loans acquired and accounted for based on contractual cash flows of the loans acquired in the us card acquisition  there were loans of billion designated as held for investment that had existing revolving privileges at acquisition and were  therefore  excluded from the accounting guidance applied to the acquired loans described in the paragraphs above 
these loans were recorded at a fair value of billion  resulting in a net premium of million at acquisition 
fair value was determined by discounting all expected cash flows contractual principal  interest  finance charges and fees of billion less those amounts not expected to be collected of billion at a market discount rate 
under applicable accounting guidance  we are required to amortize the net premium of million over the contractual principal amount as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining life of the loans 
given the guidance applicable to acquired revolving loans  it is necessary to record an allowance through provision expense to properly recognize an estimate of incurred losses on the existing principal balances  which represents a portion of the total amounts not expected to be collected described above 
at acquisition  we recorded a provision for credit losses of billion to establish an initial allowance primarily related to these loans 
the allowance was calculated using the same methodology utilized for determining the allowance for our existing credit card portfolio 
the provision for credit losses of billion is included in the total provision for credit losses of billion recorded during as indicated in note allowance for loan and lease losses 
excluded from the amounts above were acquired revolving loans from the us card acquisition with a fair value of million that we designated as held for sale at acquisition 
we closed on the sale of these receivables early in the third quarter

the significant increase in loans held for investment was attributable to the addition of billion of loans from the ing direct acquisition and billion of loans classified as held for investment from the us card acquisition  which was partially offset by the continued expected run off of loans in businesses we exited or repositioned  other loan pay downs and charge offs 
credit quality we closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk 
trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator  among other considerations  of credit risk within our loan portfolios 
the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses 
accordingly  key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates  as well as charge off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance  commercial loans

acquired loans are excluded from loans reported as days and still accruing interest and nonperforming loans 
credit card our credit card loan portfolio is generally highly diversified across millions of accounts and multiple geographies without significant individual exposures 
we therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis 
the risk in our credit card portfolio is correlated with broad economic trends  such as unemployment rates  gross domestic product gdp  and home values  as well as customer liquidity  which can have a material effect on credit performance 
the primary factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge off trends  including an analysis of the migration of loans between delinquency categories over time 
the table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio and delinquency statistics as of december  and we also present comparative net charge offs for the years ended december  and

calculated by dividing net charge offs by average loans held for investment during and home loan our home loan portfolio consists of both first lien and second lien residential mortgage loans 
in evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio  we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on our overall home loan portfolio  such as vintage  geographic concentrations  lien priority and product type 
certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices since the home price peak in and the rise in unemployment 
these loan concentrations include loans originated between and in an environment of decreasing home sales  broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards and loans on properties in arizona  california  florida and nevada  which have experienced the most severe decline in home prices

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued commercial banking we evaluate the credit risk of commercial loans individually and use a risk rating system to determine the credit quality of our commercial loans 
we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt 
in determining the risk rating of a particular loan  among the factors considered are the borrower s current financial condition  historical credit performance  projected future credit performance  prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors  the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends 
the ratings scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows noncriticized loans that have not been designated as criticized  frequently referred to as pass loans 
criticized performing loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed  affecting earnings  cash flows or collateral values 
the borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near term obligations  however  the stress  left unabated  may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date 
criticized nonperforming loans that are not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any 
loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well defined weakness  or weaknesses  which jeopardize the repayment of the debt 
these loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status 
we use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting  determining the frequency of review of the credit exposures and evaluation and determination of the allowance for commercial loans 
loans of million or more designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified graded and whether impairment exists 
noncriticized loans greater than million are specifically reviewed  at least annually  to determine the appropriate loan grading 
in addition  during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due  we evaluate the risk rating

unfunded lending commitments we manage the potential risk in credit commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements  both by individual customer and in total  by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and by applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities 
unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
while these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines  we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time 
in addition to available unused credit card lines  we enter into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards 
collateral requirements and loan to value ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
these commitments may expire without being drawn upon  therefore  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements 
the outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit  other than credit card lines  were approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively

historically  our primary involvement with vies has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts 
these securitization trusts typically meet the definition of a vie 
we have generally securitized credit card loans  auto loans  home loans and installment loans  which have provided a source of funding for us and as a means of transferring a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties 
the entity that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 
the vast majority of the vies in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements 
summary of consolidated and unconsolidated vies the table below presents a summary of vies  aggregated based on vies with similar characteristics  in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest as of december  and we separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated vies 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued for consolidated vies  we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
the assets of consolidated vies primarily consist of cash and loans  which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors and restricted loans for securitization investors  respectively 
the assets of a particular vie are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations 
the creditors of the vies typically do not have recourse to the general credit of our company 
the liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the vies  which we report under securitized debt obligations 
for unconsolidated vies  we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss 
our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the vies became worthless and we were required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued represents the gross assets and liabilities owned by the vie  which includes seller s interest and retained and repurchased notes held by other related parties 
the carrying amount of assets of unconsolidated securitization related vies consists of retained interests and letters of credit related to manufactured housing securitizations and are reported on our consolidated balance sheets under accounts receivable from securitizations 
the carrying amount of liabilities of securitization related vies is comprised of obligations to fund negative amortization bonds associated with the securitization of option adjustable rate mortgage loans option arms and obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitization of manufactured housing loans 
the maximum exposure to loss represents the amount of loss we would incur in the unlikely event that all of our assets in the vie become worthless and we were required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations 
securitization related vies we historically have securitized credit card loans  auto loans  home loans and installment loans 
in a securitization transaction  assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust we establish  which typically meets the definition of a vie 
the trust then issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors 
we typically receive cash proceeds and or other interests in the securitization trust for the assets we transfer 
if the transfer of the assets to an unconsolidated securitization trust qualifies as a sale  we remove the assets from our consolidated balance sheet and recognize a gain or loss on the transfer 
alternatively  if the transfer does not qualify as a sale but instead is considered a secured borrowing or the transfer of assets is to a consolidated vie  the assets remain on our consolidated balance sheets and we record an offsetting liability for the proceeds received 
our continuing involvement in the majority of our securitization transactions consists primarily of holding certain retained interests and acting as the primary servicer 
we also may be required to repurchase receivables from the trust if the outstanding balance of the receivables falls to a level where the cost exceeds the benefits of servicing such receivables 
we also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties 
see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees for information related to reserves we have established for our potential mortgage representation and warranty exposure

see the information below regarding our on going involvement in the greenpoint home equity line of credit heloc securitizations 
the manufactured housing securitizations are serviced by a third party 
for two of the deals  that third party works in the capacity of subservicer with capital one being the master servicer 
amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics such as charge off rates or delinquency rates below certain predetermined thresholds 
generally  the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust related cash flows to the benefit of senior noteholders 
non mortgage securitizations as of december  and  we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of all of our non mortgage securitization trusts 
accordingly  all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements 
mortgage securitizations option arm loans we had previously securitized option arm mortgage loans by transferring the mortgage loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage backed securities to investors 
the outstanding balance of debt securities held by third party investors related to our mortgage loan securitization trusts was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we continue to service some of the outstanding balance of securitized mortgage receivables 
we also retain rights to future cash flows arising from the receivables  the most significant being certificated interest only bonds issued by the trusts 
we generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows from securitized and sold receivables  using our best estimates of the 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued key assumptions which include credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
we do not consolidate these trusts because we do not have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts 
in connection with the securitization of certain option arm loans  a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any negative amortization resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period 
we have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement 
the amount advanced is tracked through mortgage backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction 
as the borrowers make principal payments  these securities receive their net pro rata portion of those payments in cash and advances of negative amortization are refunded accordingly 
as advances occur  we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds  which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
we have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities 
these are classified as free standing derivatives  with fair value adjustments recorded in non interest income 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities for further details on these derivatives 
greenpoint mortgage helocs our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit  greenpoint  previously sold home equity lines of credit in whole loan sales and subsequently acquired a residual interest in certain trusts which securitized some of those loans 
as the residual interest holder  greenpoint is required to fund advances on the home equity lines of credit when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance 
we had funded million in advances through december   all of which were expensed as funded 
our unfunded commitment related to these residual interests was million as of december  as a result of changes in facts and circumstances related to our involvement in vies during the fourth quarter of  the assets and liabilities and results of operations and cash flows related to that entity have been incorporated into our consolidated financial from the date of initial consolidation in the fourth quarter of the carrying amount of the entity s assets and liabilities are included in the december  consolidated home loan securitizations amounts shown in the table above 
greenpoint mortgage manufactured housing we retain the primary obligation for certain provisions of corporate guarantees  recourse sales and clean up calls related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of greenpoint credit llc gpc  which was sold to a third party in although we are the primary obligor  recourse obligations related to former gpc whole loan sales  commitments to exercise mandatory clean up calls on certain gpc securitization transactions and servicing were transferred to a third party in the sale transaction 
we do not consolidate the trusts used for the securitization of manufactured housing loans because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts since we no longer service the loans 
we were required to fund letters of credit in to cover losses and are obligated to fund future amounts under swap agreements for certain transactions 
we have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released 
the amount available under the letters of credit was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the expected residual balances on the funded letters of credit was million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
in the event the 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued third party sevicer does not fulfill on its options to exercise the clean up calls on certain transactions  the obligation reverts to us and we would assume approximately million of loans receivable upon our execution of the clean up call with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loans receivable 
there have been no instances of non performance to date by the third party 
we monitor the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and review the purchaser s financial strength as well as servicing performance 
these factors are considered in assessing the adequacy of the liabilities established for these obligations and the valuations of the assets 
other vies affordable housing entities as part of our community reinvestment initiatives  we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi family affordable housing properties 
we receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments

impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances change  such as adverse changes in the business climate  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units at the date of acquisition 
our reporting units are domestic credit card  international credit card  auto finance  other consumer banking and commercial banking 
as of december  and  goodwill of billion and billion  respectively  was included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the goodwill impairment test  performed at october of each year  is a two step test 
the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
during the second quarter of  we acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the credit card and private label credit card business of hsbc 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded goodwill of million representing the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the goodwill was assigned to the credit card segment 
see note acquisitions for information regarding the us card acquisition 
for the annual impairment test  the fair value of reporting units was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis  a form of the income approach  using each reporting unit s internal forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate reflecting the nominal growth rate of the economy as a whole and appropriate discount rates for the respective reporting units 
cash flows were adjusted  as necessary  in order to maintain each reporting unit s equity capital requirements 
our discounted cash flow analysis required management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth  revenue growth  credit losses  and capital rates 
the cash flows were discounted to present value using reporting unit specific discount rates that are largely based on our 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit 
discount rates used for the reporting units ranged from to 
the key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were corroborated with market data  where available  indicating that assumptions used were within a reasonable range of observable market data 
based on the comparison of fair value to carrying amount  as calculated using the methodology summarized above  fair value exceeded the carrying amount for all reporting units as of our annual testing date 
therefore  the goodwill of our reporting units was considered not impaired  and the second step of impairment testing was unnecessary 
as part of the annual goodwill impairment test  we assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined that any excess fair value in our reporting units at that time could be attributed to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry 
we calculate the carrying values of our reporting units using an economic capital approach based on each reporting unit s specific capital requirements and risks 
total reporting unit carrying values for the october  annual goodwill impairment test were billion  compared to total company equity of billion as of september  as reported in our third quarter form q filed with the sec 
the billion remaining equity is primarily attributable to the following items capital allocated to our other operations  which are discussed in note business segments  preferred stock and unrealized gains in aoci related to available for sale securities  and capital that is reserved for building up to future capital requirements related to our reporting units and our other operations 
the remaining equity  which represented approximately of our total equity  is reserved for future capital needs such as balance sheet growth  acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases and one time events subject to regulatory approvals 
the capital reserved for our reporting units future capital requirements is not included in our reporting unit carrying values for our annual goodwill impairment test  since it does not represent capital allocated to and used in our reporting units businesses as of october   however  if the reserved capital was allocated to our reporting units carrying values for our annual goodwill impairment test  the reporting units fair values would continue to exceed their carrying values  resulting in no goodwill impairment 
we will continue to regularly monitor our market capitalization and capital allocations in  overall economic conditions and other events or circumstances that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued note derivative instruments and hedging activities use of derivatives we manage our asset liability position and market risk exposure in accordance with prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our asset liability management committee and approved by our board of directors 
our primary market risk stems from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates  and to a lesser extent  changes in foreign exchange rates 
we manage our interest rate sensitivity through several approaches  which include  but are not limited to  changing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of various balance sheet categories and by entering into interest rate derivatives 
derivatives are also utilized to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts  which are often referred to as over the counter otc derivatives  or they may be listed and traded on an exchange 
we execute our derivative contracts in both the otc and exchange traded derivative markets 
in addition to interest rate swaps  we use a variety of other derivative instruments  including caps  floors  options  futures and forward contracts  to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk 
on a regular basis  we enter into customer derivative transactions 
we engage in these transactions as a service to our commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management objectives 
we typically offset the market risk exposure to our customer accommodation derivatives through derivative transactions with other counterparties 
accounting for derivatives we account for derivatives pursuant to the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging activities 
the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  the decrease was due primarily to the termination of hedges associated with the ing direct acquisition 
the notional amount provides an indication of the volume of our derivatives activity and is used as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined  however  it is generally not the amount exchanged 
derivatives are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of a derivative represents our estimate of the amount at which a derivative could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we report derivatives in a gain position  or derivative assets  in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets 
we report derivatives in a loss position  or derivative liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities 
we report derivative asset and liability amounts on a gross basis based on individual contracts  which does not take into consideration the effects of master counterparty netting agreements or collateral netting 
the fair value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets was billion and million  respectively  as of december   compared with billion and million  respectively  as of december  our derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free standing derivatives 
free standing derivatives consist of customer accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that we enter into for risk management purposes that are not linked to specific assets or liabilities or to forecasted transactions and  therefore  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges  cash flow hedges or net investment hedges 
fair value hedges we designate derivatives as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities  which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates 
changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness 
our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed rate senior notes  subordinated notes  securitization debt  and brokered 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued certificates of deposits 
these hedges have maturities through and have the effect of converting some of our fixed rate debt  deposits and investments to variable rate 
cash flow hedges we designate derivatives as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions 
changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of aoci  to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective  and amounts are reclassified from aoci to earnings as the forecasted transactions occur 
to the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships  the amounts are recorded in current period earnings 
our cash flow hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to hedge the variability in interest payments on some of our variable rate debt issuances and assets through these hedges have the effect of converting some of our variable rate debt and assets to a fixed rate 
we also have entered into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency denominated debt 
free standing derivatives we use free standing derivatives  to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights msrs  mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held 
we also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free standing derivatives 
changes in the fair value of free standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non interest income 
balance sheet presentation the following table summarizes the fair value and related outstanding notional amounts of derivative instruments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and the fair value amounts are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not  and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories

we expect to reclassify net after tax gains of million recorded in aoci as of december   related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to earnings over the next months  which we expect to offset against the cash flows associated with the hedged forecasted transactions 
the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was five years as of december  the amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy 
credit risk related contingency features certain of our derivative contracts include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies 
in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade  some of our derivative counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions 
other derivative contracts include provisions that would  in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade  allow our derivative counterparties 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued to demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position 
certain of our derivative contracts may allow  in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating of any kind  our derivative counterparties to demand additional collateralization on such derivative instruments in a net liability position

we were required to post collateral  consisting of a combination of cash and securities  totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
if our debt credit rating had fallen below investment grade  we would have been required to post additional collateral of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
derivative counterparty credit risk derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the contractual terms of the contract 
our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk  at any point in time  is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position  or derivative assets  assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral 
to mitigate the risk of counterparty default  we maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties 
these agreements typically require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative financial instruments exceed established thresholds 
we received cash collateral from derivatives counterparties totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we also received securities from derivatives counterparties totaling million as of december   which we have the ability to repledge 
we posted cash collateral in accounts maintained by derivative counterparties totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our derivative assets to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty 
we consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment  which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contract  collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty 
the cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative asset balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we also adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our credit quality 
we calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve 
the cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our credit quality recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative liability balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively

the capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of their assets and off balance sheet items 
under the capital adequacy standards  bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage capital ratio of at least for banks that meet certain specified criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating in order to be considered adequately capitalized 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued national banks also are subject to prompt corrective action capital regulations 
under prompt corrective action regulations  a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a tier risk based capital ratio of at least basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard  a total risk based capital ratio of at least basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and is not subject to any supervisory agreement  order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital reserve 
a bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it meets these minimum capital ratios and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition 
currently  prompt corrective action capital requirements do not apply to bank holding companies 
we also disclose a tier common ratio for our bank holding company 
there is currently no mandated minimum or well capitalized standard for tier common  instead the risk based capital rules state that voting common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier common capital 
while this regulatory capital measure is widely used by investors  analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies  it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we are also subject to minimum cash reserve requirements by the federal reserve totaling approximately billion as of december  the federal reserve  occ and fdic released in june proposed rules that would increase the general risk based capital ratio minimum requirements  modify the definition of regulatory capital  establish a minimum tier common ratio requirement  introduce a new capital conservation buffer requirement  and update the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums 
the table below provides a comparison of our capital ratios under the federal reserve s capital adequacy standards and the capital ratios of the banks under the occ s capital adequacy standards as of december  and as of december  and  we exceeded minimum capital requirements and would meet the well capitalized ratio levels specified under prompt corrective action for total risk based capital and tier risk based capital under federal reserve standards for bank holding companies

the company currently has tax refund claims pending with the irs for the tax years through that are under review by the irs 
the irs began its examination of the company s federal income tax returns for the years and in april and this examination is ongoing 
it is reasonably possible that further adjustments to the company s unrecognized tax benefits may be made within twelve months of the reporting date as a result of the above referenced pending matters 
at this time  an estimate of the potential change to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made 
as of december   us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us  in accordance with the guidance for accounting for income taxes in special areas 
these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely 
upon repatriation of these earnings  we could be subject to both us income taxes subject to possible adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability and foreign 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued withholding tax on these unremitted earnings is not practicable at this time because such liability is dependent upon circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 
as of december   us income taxes have not been provided for approximately million of previously acquired thrift bad debt reserves created for tax purposes as of december  these amounts  acquired as a result of the merger with north fork bancorporation  inc and the acquisition of chevy chase bank  fsb  are subject to recapture in the unlikely event that cona  as successor to north fork bank and chevy chase bank fsb  makes distributions in excess of earnings and profits  redeems its stock  or liquidates 
note fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
the fair value accounting guidance provides a three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments 
this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level unobservable inputs the accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value 
the accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect  on a contract by contract basis  to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value into earnings 
we have not made any material fair value option elections as of and for the years ended december  and level  and valuation techniques financial instruments are considered level when the valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level financial instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
financial instruments are considered level when their values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable and when the determination of the fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
the following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  and

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued we do not offset the fair value of derivative contracts in a loss position against the fair value of contracts in a gain position 
we also do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement 
does not reflect million and million recognized as a net valuation allowance on derivative assets and liabilities for non performance risk as of december  and  respectively 
non performance risk is reflected in other assets liabilities on the balance sheet and offset through the income statement in other income 
the determination of the classification of financial instruments in level or level of the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period 
we consider all available information  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs 
based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category  judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
during  we had minimal movements between levels and level instruments only financial instruments are considered level when their values are determined using pricing models  which include comparison of prices from multiple sources  discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable or there is significant variability among pricing sources 
level financial instruments also include those for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
the tables below present a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level 
when assets and liabilities are transferred between levels  we recognize the transfer as of the end of the period

gains losses related to level derivative receivables and derivative payables are reported in other non interest income  which is a component of non interest income 
gains losses related to level retained interests in securitizations are reported in servicing and securitizations income  which is a component of non interest income 
the transfers out of level for the years ended december  and was primarily driven by greater consistency among multiple pricing sources 
the transfers into level were primarily driven by less consistency among vendor pricing on individual securities 
the amount presented for unrealized gains loss for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments for available for sale securities  accretion on certain fixed maturity securities  and change in fair value of derivative instruments 
the impairments are reported in total other than temporary losses as a component of non interest income 
significant level fair value asset and liability input sensitivity changes in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value 
certain of these unobservable inputs will in isolation have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input 
alternatively  the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input 
in general  an increase in the discount rate  default rates  loss severity and credit spreads  in isolation  would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement 
in addition  an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates  slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued fair value governance and control we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable 
our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties 
our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types  price verification and review of valuation judgments  methods  models  process controls and results 
groups independent from our trading and investing functions  including our valuations group  model validation group and fair value committee fvc  participate in the review and validation process 
the fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved at the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee vac for resolution 
the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer 
membership of the vac includes the chief risk officer 
our valuations group performs periodic independent verification of fair value measurements by using independent analytics and other available market data to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable 
for example  in cases where we rely on third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures  we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources  including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources  where necessary 
additional validation procedures performed by the valuations group include reviewing either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values valuation inputs and assumptions  and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices 
the validation group periodically evaluates alternative methodologies and recommends improvements to valuation techniques 
we perform due diligence reviews of the third party pricing services by comparing their prices with prices from other sources and reviewing other control documentation 
additionally  when necessary  we challenge prices from third party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process 
this may include a request for a transparency of the assumptions used by the third party 
the fvc  which includes representation from business areas  our risk management division and our finance division  is a forum for discussing fair valuations  inputs  assumptions  methodologies  variance thresholds  valuation control environment and material risks or concerns related to fair valuations 
additionally  the fvc is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the valuations control group 
it provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment 
the fvc regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance 
the chief financial officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the audit and risk committee or other delegated committee of the board of directors 
we have a model policy  established by an independent model risk office  which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following table presents the significant unobservable inputs relied upon to determine the fair values of our recurring level financial instruments 
we utilize multiple third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for our securities 
several of our third party pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions 
other third party pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation 
as a result  the unobservable input information for the available for sale securities presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain for a majority of our securities 
the unobservable input information for all other level financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis we are required to measure and recognize certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets 
these financial assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances for example  when we evaluate impairment 
loans held for sale loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost  net of deferred fees and deferred origination costs  or fair value 
the fair value of loans held for sale is determined using a discounted cash flow model or the fair value of the underlying collateral  less the estimated cost to sell 
held for sale loans that are valued using a discounted cash flow model are classified as level loans that are valued using fair value less the estimated cost to sell have significant unobservable inputs and are classified as level under the fair value hierarchy 
fair value adjustments to loans held for sale are recorded in other non interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
loans held for investment  net loans held for investment that are individually assessed for impairment are carried at the fair value of the underlying collateral  less the estimated cost to sell 
due to the use of unobservable inputs  loans held for investment are classified as level under the fair value hierarchy 
fair value adjustments for loans held for investment are recorded in provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income 
foreclosed property and other repossessed assets foreclosed property and other repossessed assets are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
due to the use of significant unobservable inputs  foreclosed property is classified as level under the fair value hierarchy 
fair value adjustments for foreclosed property are recorded in other non interest expense in the consolidated statement of income 
other assets nonrecurring other assets measured at fair value consist of long lived assets held for sale 
these assets are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
these assets are carried at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
due to the use of unobservable inputs  long lived assets held for sale are classified as level under the fair value hierarchy 
fair value adjustments for other assets are recorded in other non interest expense in the consolidated statement of income

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued the following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments as of december  and we applied the fair value provisions  to the financial instruments not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value  which include loans held for investment  interest receivable  non interest bearing and interest bearing deposits  other borrowings  senior and subordinated notes  and interest payable 
the provisions requiring us to maximize the use of observable inputs and to measure fair value using a notion of exit price were factored into our selection of inputs of our established valuation techniques 
financial assets cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest bearing deposits with banks approximate fair value 
restricted cash for securitization investors the carrying amounts of restricted cash for securitization investors approximate their fair value due to their relatively short term nature 
securities available for sale quoted prices in active markets are used to measure the fair value of us treasury securities 
for other investment categories  we utilize multiple third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for the large majority of our securities 
a pricing service may be considered as the primary pricing provider for certain types of securities  and the designation of the primary pricing provider may vary depending on the type of securities 
the determination of the primary pricing provider is based on our experience and validation benchmark of the pricing service s performance in terms of providing fair value measurement for the various types of securities 
certain securities available for sale are classified as level and  the majority of which are collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities 
level and classifications indicate that significant valuation assumptions are not consistently observable in the market 
when significant assumptions are not consistently observable  fair values are derived using the best available data 
such data may include quotes provided by a dealer  the use of external pricing services  independent pricing models  or other model based valuation techniques such as calculation of the present values of future cash flows incorporating assumptions such as benchmark yields  spreads  prepayment speeds  credit ratings  and losses 
the techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available 
pricing models may be used  which can vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade  bid and other market information 
across asset classes  information such as trader dealer input  credit spreads  forward curves  and prepayment speeds are used to help determine appropriate valuations 
because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis  the evaluated pricing applications may apply available information through processes such as benchmarking curves  like securities  sector groupings  and matrix pricing to prepare valuations 
in addition  model processes are used by the pricing services to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
we validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing providers through comparison of pricing to additional sources  including other pricing services  dealer pricing indications in transaction results  and other internal sources 
pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated 
additionally  on an on going basis we may select a sample of securities and test the third party valuation by obtaining more detailed information about the pricing methodology  sources of information  and assumptions used to value the securities 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our residential  asset backed and commercial securities include yield  prepayment rate  default rate and loss severity in the event of default 
significant increases decreases in any of those inputs in isolation or combination would result in a significant change in fair value measurement 
generally  an increase in the yield assumption will result in a decrease in fair value measurement  however  an increase or decrease in prepayment rate  default rate or loss severity may have a different impact on the fair value given various characteristics of the security including the capital structure of the deal  credit enhancement for the security or other factors 
as of december   we saw further improvements in the market value of our portfolio holdings driven by lower interest rates and reduced risk premiums as compared to the increase in the amount of level securities was primarily driven by the increase in non agency mbs securities due to acquisition of ing direct securities portfolio 
loans held for sale the fair value of loans held for sale is determined using current secondary market prices for portfolios with similar characteristics 
the carrying amounts as of december  and approximate fair value 
loans held for investment  net the fair values of credit card loans  installment loans  auto loans  home loans and commercial loans were estimated using a discounted cash flow method  a form of the income approach 
discount rates were determined considering rates at which similar portfolios of loans would be made under current conditions and considering liquidity spreads applicable to each loan portfolio based on the secondary market 
the fair value of credit card loans excluded any value related to customer account relationships 
the increase in fair value above carrying amount as of december  was primarily due to a tightening of liquidity spreads and improved credit performance noted in our mortgage and commercial loan portfolios 
interest receivable the carrying amount of interest receivable approximates the fair value of this asset due to its relatively short term nature 
derivative receivables and payables we use both exchange traded derivatives and over the counter otc derivatives to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk exposure 
quoted market prices are available and used for our exchange traded derivatives  which we classify as level however  substantially all of our derivatives are traded in otc markets where quoted market prices are not always readily available 
therefore  we value most otc derivatives using valuation techniques  which include internally developed models 
we primarily rely on market observable inputs for our models  such as interest rate yield curves  credit curves  option volatility and currency rates  that vary depending on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate  price or index upon which the derivative s value is based 
where model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model does not require significant judgment  such derivatives are typically classified as level of the fair value hierarchy 
when instruments are traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable  such as interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves  the derivatives are classified as level 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued the impact of counterparty non performance risk is considered when measuring the fair value of derivative receivables 
these derivatives are included in other assets on the balance sheet 
we validate the pricing obtained from the internal models through comparison of pricing to additional sources  including external valuation agents and other internal sources 
pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices 
accordingly  we determine the fair value of msrs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
the model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income  including estimates of prepayment spreads  discount rate  cost to service  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income and late fees 
we record msrs at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value measurements of msrs use significant unobservable inputs and  accordingly  are classified as level financial liabilities non interest bearing deposits the carrying amount of non interest bearing deposits approximates fair value 
interest bearing deposits the fair value of interest bearing deposits was determined based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates consistent with current market rates for similar products with similar remaining terms 
securitized debt obligations we utilized multiple third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for the large majority of our securitized debt obligations 
the techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available  and pricing models may be used which incorporate available trade  bid and other market information as described in the above section 
we used internal pricing models  discounted cash flow models or similar techniques to estimate the fair value of certain securitization trusts where third party pricing was not available 
senior and subordinated notes we engage multiple third party pricing services in order to estimate the fair value of senior and subordinated notes 
the pricing service utilizes a pricing model that incorporates available trade  bid and other market information 
it also incorporates spread assumptions  volatility assumptions and relevant credit information into the pricing models 
federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings the carrying amount of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements approximates fair value 
the fair value of fhlb advances was determined based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued consistent with current market rates for fhlb advances with similar remaining terms 
we engage multiple third party pricing services in order to estimate the fair value of junior subordinated borrowings 
the pricing service utilizes a pricing model that incorporates available trade information 
it also incorporates available market and credit information into the pricing process 
the increase in fair value of our other borrowings above carrying values at december  was primarily due to market interest rates being slightly lower than the interest rates on the debt we own 
interest payable the carrying amount of interest payable approximates the fair value of this liability due to its relatively short term nature 
commitments we provide commitments that include extending credit and letters of credit 
these financial instruments are generally not sold or traded 
the fair values of the financial guarantees outstanding and included in other liabilities as of december  and that have been issued since january  were million 
the estimated fair values of extensions of credit and letters of credit are not readily available 
however  the fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with comparable credit risks and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties 
commitments to extend credit issued by us are generally short term in nature and  if drawn upon  are issued under current market terms and conditions for credits with comparable risks 
as of december  and  there was no material unrealized appreciation or depreciation on these financial instruments 
note business segments our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three primary business segments  which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking 
the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments 
the acquired ing direct business is primarily reflected in our consumer banking business  while the business acquired in the us card acquisition is reflected in our credit card business 
certain activities that are not part of a segment are included in the other category 
credit card consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending  national small business lending  national closed end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in canada and the united kingdom 
consumer banking consists of our branch based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses  national deposit gathering  national auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities 
commercial banking consists of our lending  deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers 
our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between million to billion 
other category includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized corporate treasury group activities  such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset liability management  to our business segments 
accordingly  net gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities are included in the other category 
the other category also includes foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the revaluation of foreign currency denominated investments  certain gains losses 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued on the sale and securitization of loans  unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance  such as acquisition and restructuring charges  provisions for representation and warranty reserves related to continuing operations  certain material items that are non recurring in nature  and offsets related to certain line item reclassifications 
basis of presentation we report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis 
see note discontinued operations for a discussion of discontinued operations 
the results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources 
we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results 
we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation  which differs in some cases  as described below  from our reported results prepared based on us gaap 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to us gaap  therefore  the managed basis presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies 
in addition  our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with us gaap 
business segment reporting methodology the results of our business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business 
our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies  including funds transfer pricing  to assign certain balance sheet assets  deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment 
total interest income and net fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported 
the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process  which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration market rates 
our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds  such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses  and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment 
the allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses 
due to the integrated nature of our business segments  estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items 
transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third party rates 
we regularly assess the assumptions  methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting  which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods 
following is additional information on the principles and methodologies used in preparing our business segment results 
net interest income interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense from deposits and other interest bearing liabilities are reflected within each applicable business segment 
because funding and asset liability management are managed centrally by our corporate treasury group  net interest income for our business segments also includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that is intended to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business segment assets and liabilities  respectively  using a matched funding concept 
also  taxable equivalent benefit of tax exempt products is allocated to each business unit with a corresponding increase in income tax expense 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued non interest income non interest fees and other revenue associated with loans or customers managed by each business segment and other direct revenues are accounted for within each business segment 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses is directly attributable to the business segment in which the loans are managed 
non interest expense non interest expenses directly managed and incurred by a business segment are accounted for within each business segment 
we allocate certain non interest expenses indirectly incurred by business segments  such as corporate support functions  to each business segment based on various factors  including the actual cost of the services from the service providers  the utilization of the services  the number of employees or other relevant factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to business segments based on the relative fair value of each segment 
intangible amortization is included in the results of the applicable segment 
income taxes income taxes are assessed for each business segment based on a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in the other category 
loans held for investment loans are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type 
deposits deposits are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type 
segment results and reconciliation we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment 
in the first quarter of  we re aligned the loan categories reported by our commercial banking business and the loan customer and product types included within each category 
as a result of this re alignment  we now report three product categories commercial and multifamily real estate  commercial and industrial loans and small ticket commercial real estate  which is a run off portfolio 
we previously reported four categories within our commercial banking business commercial and multifamily real estate  middle market  specialty lending and small ticket commercial real estate 
middle market and specialty lending related products are included in commercial and industrial loans 
all affordable housing tax related investments  some of which were previously included in the other segment  are now included in the commercial and multifamily real estate category of our commercial banking business

standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement 
commercial letters of credit are short term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client 
collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer

our contingent payment arrangements are generally based on the difference between the expected credit performance of specified loan portfolios as of the date of the applicable agreement and the actual future performance 
to the extent that actual losses associated with these portfolios are less than the expected level  we agree to share a portion of the benefit with the seller 
the maximum contingent payment amount related to our acquisitions totaled million as of december  the actual payment amount related to million of this balance will be determined as of september  the actual payment amount related to the remaining million of this balance was determined as of december  we recognized an expense related to contingent payment arrangements of million during as such  we had a liability for contingent payments related to these arrangements of million and million as of december  and  respectively

payment protection insurance in the uk  we previously sold payment protection insurance ppi 
in response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry  heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups  the uk financial services authority fsa investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies 
in connection with this matter  we have established a reserve related to ppi  which totaled million as of december  potential mortgage representation warranty liabilities in recent years  we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold them to various purchasers  including purchasers who created securitization trusts 
these subsidiaries are capital one home loans  which was acquired in february  greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint  which was acquired in december as part of the north fork acquisition  and ccb  which was acquired in february and subsequently merged into cona 
in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
the representations and warranties do not address the credit performance 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued of the mortgage loans  but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty 
each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties 
in the event of a repurchase  the subsidiary is typically required to pay the then unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses including  in certain cases  legal costs incurred by the purchaser and or others 
the subsidiary then recovers the loan or  if the loan has been foreclosed  the underlying collateral 
the subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral 
in some instances  rather than repurchase the loans  a subsidiary may agree to make a cash payment to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims 
in addition  our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties 
in some cases  the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans 
these subsidiaries  in total  originated and sold to non affiliates approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between and  which are the years or vintages with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase requests and other related claims 
the following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations  by vintage for through  for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the outstanding principal balance as of december  and unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to third parties based on category of purchaser unpaid principal balance december  original unpaid principal balance dollars in billions total government sponsored enterprises gses insured securitizations uninsured securitizations and other total gses include fannie mae and freddie mac 
between and  our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the gses 
of the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance insured securitizations  approximately billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries active insured securitizations  and the remaining approximately billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries inactive insured securitizations 
insured securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors 
bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers  and they often have super majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase requests without coordination with other investors 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others  we do not have complete information about the current ownership of the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to gses or placed in insured securitizations 
we have determined based on information obtained from third party databases that about billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans are currently held by private label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance uninsured securitizations 
in contrast with the bond insurers in insured securitizations  investors in uninsured securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can force a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases  including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes 
despite these legal and logistical hurdles  there is a risk that securitization trustees will pursue mortgage repurchase litigation unilaterally or in coordination with investors 
there is also a risk that investors will be able to successfully pursue repurchase litigation independently and without the involvement of the trustee as a party 
an additional approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans 
of this amount  we believe approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were ultimately purchased by gses 
for purposes of our reserves setting process  we consider these loans to be private label loans rather than gse loans 
various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in this category 
with respect to the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between and  we estimate that approximately billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of december   approximately billion in losses have been realized and approximately billion in unpaid principal balance is at least days delinquent 
because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others  we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans 
these amounts reflect our best estimates  including extrapolations where necessary 
these extrapolations occur on the approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans for which we do not have complete information about the current holders or the underlying credit performance 
these estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis 
the subsidiaries had open repurchase requests relating to approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as of december   compared with billion as of december  as of december   the majority of new repurchase demands received over the last year and  as discussed below  the majority of our million reserve relates to the billion of original principal balance of mortgage loans originally sold to the gses or to active insured securitizations 
currently  repurchase demands predominantly relate to the and vintages 
we have received relatively few repurchase demands from the and vintages  mostly because greenpoint ceased originating mortgages in august 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued the following table presents information on pending repurchase requests by counterparty category and timing of initial repurchase request 
the amounts presented are based on original loan principal balances 
open pipeline all vintages all entities dollars in millions all amounts are original principal balance gses insured securitizations uninsured securitizations and other total open claims as of december  gross new demands received loans repurchased made whole demands rescinded reclassifications open claims as of december  gross new demands received loans repurchased made whole demands rescinded reclassifications open claims as of december  the open pipeline includes all repurchase requests ever received by our subsidiaries where either the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase request and where our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses 
accordingly  repurchase requests denied by our subsidiaries and not pursued by the counterparty remain in the open pipeline 
moreover  repurchase requests submitted by parties without contractual standing to pursue repurchase requests are included within the open pipeline unless the requesting party has formally rescinded its repurchase request 
finally  the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans 
represents adjustments to correct the counterparty category as of december  and for amounts that were misclassified 
the reclassification had no impact on the total pending repurchase requests  however  it resulted in an increase in open claims attributable to gses and insured securitizations and a decrease in open claims attributable to uninsured securitizations and other 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
these reserves are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 
we build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses  which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non interest income for loans originated and sold by ccb and capital one home loans and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by greenpoint 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser 
in establishing reserves for the billion original principal balance of gse loans  we rely on the historical relationship between gse loan losses and repurchase outcomes for each gse  adjusted for any bulk settlements  to estimate the percentage of current and future gse loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests from the gses over the lifetime of the gse loans  and the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases 
we also rely on estimated collateral valuations and loss forecast models to estimate our lifetime liability on gse loans 
this reserving approach to the gse loans reflects the historical interaction with the gses around repurchase requests  and also includes anticipated repurchases resulting from mortgage insurance rescissions 
the gses typically have stronger contractual rights than non gse counterparties because gse contracts typically do not contain prompt notice requirements for repurchase requests or materiality qualifications to the representations and warranties 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued moreover  for the potential gse repurchase liability remaining after bulk settlements  we have established a negotiation pattern whereby the gses and our subsidiaries continually negotiate around individual repurchase requests  leading to the gses rescinding some repurchase requests and our subsidiaries agreeing in some cases to repurchase some loans or make the gses whole with respect to losses 
our lifetime representation and warranty reserves with respect to gse repurchase liability remaining after bulk settlements are grounded in this history 
one of our subsidiaries entered into a bulk settlement with a gse to resolve present and future repurchase claims in the first quarter of  and our reserves allocated to the gse segment reflect the amount of that settlement 
for the billion original principal balance in active insured securitizations  our reserving approach also reflects our historical interaction with monoline bond insurers around repurchase requests 
typically  monoline bond insurers allege a very high repurchase rate with respect to the mortgage loans in the active insured securitization category 
in response to these repurchase requests  our subsidiaries typically request information from the monoline bond insurers demonstrating that the contractual requirements around a valid repurchase request have been satisfied 
in response to these requests for supporting documentation  monoline bond insurers typically initiate litigation 
accordingly  our reserves within the active insured securitization segment are not based upon the historical repurchase rate with monoline bond insurers  but rather upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers 
every bond insurer within this category is pursuing a substantially similar litigation strategy either through active or probable litigation 
accordingly  our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves 
in establishing litigation reserves for this category  we consider current and future losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the anticipated factual and legal record to estimate the lifetime legal liability for each securitization 
our estimated legal liability for each securitization within this category assumes that we will be responsible for only a portion of the losses inherent in each securitization 
our litigation reserves with respect to the us bank litigation  the dbsp litigation  and the ambac litigation  in each case as referenced below  are contained within the active insured securitization reserve category 
further  our litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third party securitizations sponsors  where one of our subsidiaries provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation  are also contained within this category 
for the billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the inactive insured securitizations category and the billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the uninsured securitizations and other whole loan sales categories  we establish reserves by relying on our historical activity and repurchase rates to estimate repurchase liabilities over the next twelve months 
we do not believe we can estimate repurchase liability for these categories for a period longer than twelve months because of the relatively irregular nature of repurchase activity within these categories 
some uninsured securitization investors from this category who have not made repurchase requests or filed representation and warranty lawsuits are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and or state securities laws 
although we face some direct and indirect indemnity risks from these litigations  we generally have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities 
the aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  we recorded a total provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses for our representation and warranty repurchase exposure of million in  which was primarily driven by updated estimates of anticipated outcomes from various litigation and threatened litigation in the insured securitization segment based on relevant factual and legal developments and an increased reserve associated with a settlement in the first quarter of between a subsidiary and a gse to resolve present and future repurchase claims 
the decrease in the reserve in was driven primarily by the settlement of claims 
during  we had settlements of repurchase requests totaling million that were charged against the reserve

as part of our business planning processes  we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards 
our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims as of december  beyond what is in our reserve is approximately billion 
as of september  and december   estimates of reasonably possible losses were billion and billion  respectively 
the estimate as of december  covers all reasonably possible losses relating to relating to the representation and warranty claim activity including those relating to the us bank litigation  the dbsp 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated financial statements continued litigation  the ambac litigation  the fhfa litigation  and the fhlb of boston litigation 
the increase since september  is attributable to updated assessments of reasonably possible future losses based primarily on increased securitization trustee activity and adverse legal developments in litigation in which our subsidiaries are not parties  but which could influence litigation in which our subsidiaries are parties  in each case occurring after the end of notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future loss beyond our current accrual levels based on current information  it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses 
this estimate involves considerable judgment  and reflects that there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels  including  but not limited to  anticipated litigation outcomes  future repurchase and indemnification claim levels  ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates  future mortgage loan performance levels  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
in light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters  an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period 
litigation in accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies  we establish reserves for litigation related matters when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance 
below we provide a description of material legal proceedings and claims 
for some of the matters disclosed below  we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build  but which are reasonably possible outcomes 
for other disclosed matters  such an estimate is not possible at this time 
for those matters below where an estimate is possible  excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the us bank litigation  the dbsp litigation  the ambac litigation  the fhfa litigation  and the fhlb of boston litigation because reasonably possible losses with respect to those litigations are included within the reasonably possible representation and warranty liabilities discussed above  management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses could be approximately million 
notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information  it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here 
given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters  and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters  there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period
