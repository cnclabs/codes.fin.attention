item selected financial data not required for smaller reporting companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties 
at january   the innsuites system included five moderate and full service hotels with hotel suites 
four of our hotels are branded through membership agreements with best western 
all five hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants  meeting banquet room rentals and the operation of a reservation system 
our operations consist of one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  we receive management fees and reservation fees from three hotels owned by mr 
wirth and his affiliates  trademark license fees from one hotel owned by a non related third party and reservation fees from sixty one hotels owned by non related third parties 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing  which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
management expects greater demand and steady supply to continue 
however  either a further increase in supply or a further decline in demand could result in increased competition  which could have an adverse effect on the revenue of the hotels in their respective markets 
weak economic conditions  both generally and specifically in the travel industry  had a negative impact on our operations in fiscal years and we anticipate moderate improvement in these conditions during fiscal year we expect moderate improvements in overall economic conditions to result in improved business and leisure travel and relatively steady room rates 
we expect the major challenge for fiscal year to be the continuation of strong competition for corporate leisure group and government business in the markets in which we operate  which may affect our ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we believe that we have positioned the hotels to remain competitive through selective refurbishment  by carrying a relatively large number of two room suites at each location and by maintaining a robust guest internet access system 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
at january   through our sole general partner s interest in the partnership  we owned a interest in a hotel tucson  arizona  direct interest in the albuquerque  new mexico hotel  and a direct interest in the yuma  arizona hotel 
additionally  at january   we together with the partnership owned a interest in another hotel located in tucson  arizona and a interest in a hotel located in ontario  california 
at january   through our sole general partner s interest in the partnership  we owned a interest in hotels in ontario  california and tucson  arizona  direct interest in the albuquerque  new mexico hotel  interest in another tucson  arizona hotel  and a direct interest in the yuma  arizona hotel 
we purchased  partnership class a units during the year ended january  we purchased  partnership class a units during the year ended january  our expenses consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels and hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist primarily of payroll  guest and maintenance supplies  marketing and utilities expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse us for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  which is calculated as rooms sold divided by total rooms available  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the hotels 
in fiscal year  occupancy increased to from in the prior year 
adr decreased by or to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the reduced adr resulted in a decrease in revpar of or to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increased occupancy and continued pressure on rates reflect the slowly improving economy and travel industry during fiscal year we have accepted slightly reduced rates to increase our occupancy 
the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the years ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that occupancy  adr and revpar will not increase or decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions 
we enter into transactions with certain related parties from time to time

results of operations of the trust for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  overview a summary of operating results for the fiscal years ended january is changes change total revenues less payroll reimbursements from related parties total revenues operating expenses without payroll costs related to management contracts operating income loss without payroll costs related to management contracts interest income interest expense consolidated loss before payroll costs related to management contracts our overall results in fiscal year were positively affected by the improving economic environment and the hospitality industry in particular 
revenue for the twelve months ended january   we had total revenue of million compared to million for the twelve months ended january   a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease in total revenue is primarily due to the management agreements with the three affiliated hotels being amended 
during fiscal year  the trust did not provide the personnel for the three hotels and therefore did not recognize payroll reimbursement revenue 
these agreements were discontinued and the trust does not expect to realize such revenue in the future 
during fiscal year  the trust recognized income of million related to personnel reimbursements 
total revenue for fiscal year was million without these reimbursements 
when compared to this adjusted total  fiscal year revenues increased  or 
during fiscal year  we expect improvements in occupancy and modest improvements in rates 
expenses total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  reflect a decrease of approximately million compared to total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to the amendments to the management contracts mentioned above resulting in no payroll expenses related to those three hotels 
total expenses for fiscal year were million without these payroll expenses 
when compared to this adjusted total  fiscal year total expenses decreased room expense consisting of salaries and related taxes for property management  front office  housekeeping personnel  reservation fees and room supplies increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to million in the prior year period for approximately an increase in costs 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in occupancy rate 
general and administrative expenses include overhead charges for management  accounting  shareholder and legal services 
general and administrative expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  decreased  from million for the twelve months ended january  primarily due to decreased payroll and professional fees at the corporate office 
sales and marketing expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  were consistent with the prior year as were most other expense categories 
total operating expenses were million for the twelve months ended january   a decrease of million from the prior year total of million 
this was primarily due to the amendments to the management agreements with the affiliated hotels resulting in no payroll costs related to management contracts in fiscal year total operating expenses for fiscal year were million without these payroll expenses 
when compared to this adjusted total  fiscal year operating expenses increased  the increase was primarily due to increased room expenses due to higher occupancy and higher food and beverage expenses due to higher revenues in that department 
total interest expense for the twelve months ended january  was  a decrease of  from million for the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to the restructuring of the ontario mortgage note payable 
net loss we had a consolidated net loss before income taxes of million for the twelve months ended january   compared to million in the prior year 
after deducting the loss allocated to the non controlling interest of  we had a net loss attributable to controlling interests of approximately million for fiscal year  which represented approximately  in additional income attributable to controlling interests  as compared to the twelve months ended january  basic and diluted net loss per share was for the twelve months ended january   compared to for fiscal year the change from the prior year is primarily attributable to reduced interest expenses due to the restructure of the ontario mortgage note payable 
overall  our non controlling interest has decreased in the current fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to our shareholders  is our share of the partnership s cash flow  quarterly distributions from albuquerque  new mexico property and through the partnership and our direct ownership of the yuma  arizona property 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is hotel operations for the one hotel property it owns and quarterly distributions from the tucson  arizona and ontario  california properties 
our liquidity  including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders  will depend upon our ability  and the partnership s ability  to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations and to service our debt 
hotel operations are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels 
we anticipate occupancy and adr will be improved in the coming year  capital improvements are expected to be reduced by approximately  from the prior year and we expect increased cash flow from the reduction of principal and interest payments on the ontario property 
additionally  we have extended and increased our bank line of credit from  to  which matures on june  as of january   the trust had  drawn on this line of credit 
we are currently in discussions with the bank and anticipate a renewal of at least an additional year on this line of credit 
as of april   the outstanding balance on the line of credit was with the expected decrease in capital improvements  the availability of the  bank line of credit which management expects to renew and increased cash flow from the reduction of principal and interest payments on the ontario property  management believes that it will have enough cash on hand to meet all of our financial obligations as they become due 
management is actively discussing with the bank an extension of the line of credit 
in addition  our management is analyzing other strategic options available to us  including the refinancing of another property or raising additional funds through additional non controlling interest sales 
we anticipate a moderate improvement in the weak overall economic situation that negatively affected results in fiscal year and  which could result in higher revenues and operating margins 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for all types of business in the markets in which we operate and our ability to maintain room rates while maintaining market share 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to the large decrease in prepaid balances and increase in payables in fiscal year  which offset the  improvement in consolidated net loss in fiscal year compared to fiscal year net cash used in investing activities totaled million and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increase in funds used in was due to increased capital refurbishment projects 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended january   compared to cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended january  the decrease was primarily due to the million additional principal pay down of the mortgage note payable on the ontario  california property  which was partially offset by net borrowings of  on the trust s bank line of credit during fiscal year as of january   we had no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements that is set aside annually  as described below 
we continue to contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund an amount equal to of the innsuites hotels revenues from operation of the hotels 
the fund is restricted by the mortgage lender for three of our properties 
as of january    was held in these accounts and is reported on our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and  respectively  for capital expenditures 
we consider the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
we plan to spend approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year the hotels also spent approximately million during both fiscal years and on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
we have minimum debt payments of approximately million and approximately million due during fiscal years and  respectively 
on november   we established a revolving bank line of credit  with a credit limit of  that was subsequently raised to  the line of credit bears interest at the prime rate plus per annum with a rate floor  has no financial covenants and matures on june  management is actively working with the lender to extend this line of credit 
the line is secured by a junior security interest in the yuma  arizona property and our trade receivables 
mr 
wirth is a guarantor on the line of credit 
on january   the trust had drawn  under the line of credit 
the largest outstanding balance on the line of credit during fiscal year was  as of january   we had mortgage notes payable of million outstanding with respect to the hotels   in secured promissory notes outstanding to unrelated third parties arising from the shares of beneficial interest and partnership unit repurchases   outstanding under our bank line of credit  and no principal due and payable under notes and advances payable to mr 
wirth and his affiliates

future positioning in viewing the hotel industry cycles  the board of trustees determined that may have been the high point of the current hotel industry cycle and further determined it was appropriate to actively seek buyers for our properties

our long term strategic plan is to obtain the full benefit of our real estate equity and to migrate our focus from a hotel owner to a hospitality service company by expanding our trademark license  management  reservation  and advertising services 
this plan is similar to strategies followed by internationally diversified hotel industry leaders  which over the last several years have reduced real estate holdings and concentrated on hospitality services 
we began our long term corporate strategy when we relinquished our reit income tax status in january  which had previously prevented us from providing management services to hotels 
in june  we acquired our trademark license and management agreements and began providing management  trademark and reservations services to our hotels 
the table below lists the hotel properties  their respective book values  mortgage balance and the listed asking price for the hotel properties 
hotel property asset values as of january  hotel property net book value mortgage balance listed asking price albuquerque ontario tucson foothills tucson city center yuma totals the listed asking price is the amount at which we would sell each of the hotels and is based on the original listed selling price adjusted to reflect recent hotel sales in the hotels areas of operation and current earnings of each of the hotels 
the listed asking price is not based on appraisals of the properties 
there is no assurance that the listed sales price for the individual hotel properties will be realized 
however  our management believes that these values are reasonable based on local market conditions and comparable sales 
changes in market conditions have in part resulted  and may in the future result  in our changing one or all of the listed asking prices 
we provide trademark licensing  management  reservation and advertising services to all the hotel properties listed above and expect to continue the trademark licensing services  which include the reservation and advertising services  and or continue the management services  which also include the reservation and advertising services  after the hotels are sold 
if any or all of these hotel properties are sold  our future management and or licensing fees could be reduced if the purchaser did not continue to retain innsuites hotels to provide those services 
in the past  when we have sold hotel properties to unrelated third parties  we have continued to provide management and or trademark licensing and reservation services after a sale 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so in the future 
as part of the board study for  greater emphasis has been placed on priority for additional management  trademark and reservations fee income 
we have determined that it is easier to sell management contracts when the trademark services are also provided 
as part of the emphasis on trademark services  we have developed two trademark packages 
the first is the traditional innsuites hotels suites regional package and the second is the innsuites boutique hotel collection  which now includes three affiliate hotels managed by us  the five trust hotels and sixty one unrelated hotels 
sales and marketing for the expansion of the innsuites boutique hotel collection are being handled internally

off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than lease commitments and legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the policies we follow for the valuation of our hotel properties  which constitute the majority of our assets  are our most critical policies 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued authoritative guidance related to the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  codified in asc topic  which we apply to determine when it is necessary to test an asset for recoverability 
on an events and circumstances basis  we review the carrying value of our hotel properties 
we will record an impairment loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and the current market value of the property do not support its carrying value 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for use  we will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel  as determined by a current appraisal or other acceptable valuation methods 
we did not recognize impairment loss in fiscal years or as of january   our management does not believe that the carrying values of any of its hotel properties are impaired 
for recent accounting pronouncements  see note to our consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 
inflation we rely entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general and innsuites hotels in particular can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates as fast as or faster than inflation
