the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in cautionary note on forward looking statements and item a  risk factors 
our business we are a premier provider of specialized polymer materials  services and solutions with operations in specialty polymer formulations  color and additive systems  polymer distribution and specialty vinyl resins 
we are also a highly specialized developer and manufacturer of performance enhancing additives  liquid colorants  and fluoropolymer and silicone colorants 
headquartered in avon lake  ohio  with sales of approximately billion  we have manufacturing sites and distribution facilities in north america  south america  europe and asia 
we currently employ approximately  people and offer more than  polymer solutions to over  customers across the globe 
we provide value to our customers through our ability to link our knowledge of polymers and formulation technology with our manufacturing and supply chain to provide an essential link between large chemical producers our raw material suppliers and designers  assemblers and processors of plastics our customers 
business model and key concepts the central focus of our business model is to provide specialized material and service solutions to our customers by leveraging our global footprint  product and technology breadth  manufacturing expertise  fully integrated information technology network  broad market reach and raw material procurement strength 
these resources enable us to capitalize on dynamic changes in the end markets we serve  which include appliances  building and construction materials  electrical and electronics  healthcare  industrial  packaging  transportation  and wire and cable markets 
key challenges overall  our business faces issues resulting from the recent economic downturn  especially as it relates to affected markets such as building and construction  consumer  electrical  and industrial 
maintaining profitability during periods of raw material price volatility is another critical challenge 
further  we need to capitalize on the opportunity to accelerate development of products that meet a growing body of environmental laws and regulations such as lead and phthalate restrictions included in the restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances and the consumer product safety information act of strategy and key trends to address these challenges and achieve our vision  we have implemented a strategy with four core components specialization  globalization  operational excellence and commercial excellence 
specialization differentiates us through products  services  technology  and solutions that add value 
globalization allows us to service our customers with consistency wherever their operations might be around the world 
operational excellence empowers us to respond to the voice of the customer while focusing on continuous improvement 
commercial excellence enables us to deliver value to customers by supporting their growth and profitability 
in the short term  we will maintain our focus on top line growth  improving or maintaining the cost price relationship with regard to raw materials and improving working capital efficiency 
in addition to driving top line growth  we have established margin improvement targets for all businesses 
in  our capital expenditures will be focused primarily to support sales growth  our continued investment in recent acquisitions  and other strategic investments 
we also continue to consider acquisitions and other synergy opportunities that complement our core platforms 
polyone corporation these actions will ensure that we continue to invest in capabilities that advance the pace of our transformation and continue to support growth in key markets and product offerings 
we will continue our enterprise wide lean six sigma program directed at improving profitability and cash flow by applying proven management techniques and strategies to key areas of the business  such as pricing  supply chain and operations management  productivity and quality 
long term trends that currently provide opportunities to leverage our strategy include the drive toward sustainability in polymers and their processing  the emergence of biodegradable and bio based polymers  consumer concern over the use of bisphenol a bpa in infant care products and developing legislation that bans lead and certain phthalates from toys and child care items 
recent developments on december   polyone acquired all of the outstanding equity of glasforms inc glasforms  a leading manufacturer of glass and carbon fiber reinforced polymers and advanced composite products  with annual sales of million 
the purchase marks polyone entry into advanced composite technology  an adjacency consistent with the company strategy of providing specialty solutions that deliver high value to customers 
the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred  was million  net of cash acquired of million 
glasforms results have been reflected within our statement of income and within our global specialty engineered materials segment since the date of acquisition 
on october   polyone entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which polyone will acquire spartech  a supplier of sustainable plastic sheet  compounding  and packaging solutions  based in clayton  missouri 
spartech will expand polyone specialty portfolio with adjacent technologies in attractive end markets we already serve as well as new ones such as aerospace and security 
by combining spartech leading market positions in sheet  rigid barrier packaging and specialty cast acrylics with polyone capabilities  we believe we can accelerate growth 
the proposed acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including the receipt of regulatory approvals and the approval of spartech stockholders 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  at the effective time of the acquisition  each issued and outstanding share of spartech common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive consideration equal to in cash and polyone common shares 
the final purchase price is dependent on  among other items  spartech debt outstanding and stock price of polyone at the time of close 
based on the closing stock price of polyone on january   the total estimated purchase price will be million 
we intend to finance the cash portion of the purchase price as well as the repayment of spartech outstanding senior notes and debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility through a combination of cash on hand and new long term debt 
in connection with the proposed spartech acquisition  on october   polyone obtained a commitment letter from bank of america  na and merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  wells fargo securities  llc and wf investment holdings  llc for a new million senior unsecured bridge facility the bridge loan 
the bridge loan is available to polyone in one draw upon consummation of the acquisition subject to a underwriting fee and a funding fee in the amount of due on the funding date of the bridge loan and on each three month anniversary thereof if polyone elects to draw upon the loan 
the bridge loan has a one year term with a roll over option subject to a roll over fee for which the bridge loan could convert into a senior secured roll over loan with a year maturity 
in lieu of drawing upon the bridge loan  we intend to obtain permanent long term debt financing of at least million prior to or upon closing of the spartech acquisition 
we expect to use these proceeds to finance part of the acquisition  pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with this acquisition and  among other things  to repay certain existing indebtedness and any applicable premium of spartech 
finally  we are currently in discussions with various banks  whereby  contingent upon the close of the pending spartech acquisition  we would increase our revolving credit facility by million to a maximum availability of million  with an additional million accordion feature 
however  we have not entered into any definitive agreement regarding such increase and there can be no assurance that we will do so 
on october   polyone board of directors increased the common share repurchase authorization amount by million common shares 
the new authorization brings the total common shares available for repurchase to million common shares

liquidity and capital resources our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of debt 
by diversifying the maturity structure  we avoid concentrations of debt  reducing liquidity risk 
we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt with cash and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
we may also seek to repurchase our outstanding equity securities 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
the following table summarizes our liquidity as of december  as of december  in millions cash and cash equivalents revolving credit availability liquidity as of december   approximately of the company s cash and cash equivalents resided outside the united states 
repatriation of these funds could result in potential foreign and domestic taxes 
based on current projections  we believe that we will be able to continue to manage and control working capital  discretionary spending and capital expenditures and that cash provided by operating activities  along with available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  should allow us to maintain adequate levels of available capital resources to fund our operations  meet debt service and minimum pension funding requirements for both the short term and long term  and continue to repurchase our outstanding equity securities 
excluding new long term debt obtained in conjunction with the pending spartech acquisition  expected sources of cash in include cash from operations  available liquidity under our revolving credit facility  if needed  and cash earn outs from the sale of previously owned equity affiliates

as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants  there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and we had availability of million under the revolving credit facility 
we are currently in discussions with various banks  whereby  contingent upon the close of the pending spartech acquisition  we would increase our revolving credit facility by million to a maximum availability of million  with an additional million accordion feature 
however  we have not entered into any definitive agreement regarding such increase and there can be no assurance that we will do so

working capital as a percentage of sales increased slightly due to our acquisition of colormatrix 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities year over year of million is principally related to higher taxes paid during  higher compensation payments in primarily related to performance  higher insurance and legal settlements received in and higher interest income receipts related to notes receivable in  offset partially by improved working capital

net cash provided by financing activities in reflects proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due and the related tender offer by which the million aggregate principal amounts of our senior notes were repurchased 
additionally  we repaid our million credit facility and million aggregate principal amount of our medium term notes 
in connection with the tender offer  we paid tender premiums and other costs of million  and we paid million of costs associated with the extinguishment of the million credit facility 
total debt the following summarizes our debt as of december  and december  december  dollars in millions debentures due senior secured term loan due senior notes due other debt total debt less short term and current portion of long term debt total long term debt  net of current portion book values include unamortized discounts  where applicable 
on december   we entered into a senior secured term loan facility  maturing december   having an aggregate principal amount of million 
we used the net proceeds from the term loan to partially fund the acquisition of colormatrix 
the interest rate per annum under the term loan is  at polyone s option  either libor subject to a floor or a prime rate  plus an applicable margin percentage 
the applicable margin is variable based upon our leverage ratio being greater than x 
the current libor and prime rates margin are and  respectively  per annum 
the effective interest rate  including deferred financing costs  on the term loan was during on december   we retired our accounts receivable facility that was set to mature in june and replaced it with a five year senior secured revolving credit facility  which includes up to million in revolving loans  subject to a borrowing base with advances against us and canadian accounts receivable and inventory 
we have the option to increase the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to million  subject to our meeting certain requirements and obtaining commitments for such increase 
the interest rates per annum applicable to loans under the revolving credit facility will be  at polyone s option  equal to either i a base rate or ii libor  for one  two or three month interest periods  in each case plus an applicable margin percentage 
the margin is variable based upon our quarterly excess availability 
the current margin percentage is i per annum in the case of base rate advances  ii per annum in the case of libor rate advances 
for additional information about our financing arrangements  see note  financing arrangements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
polyone corporation concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  including foreign exchange contracts and trade accounts receivable  subject us to potential credit risk 
concentration of credit risk for trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers constituting our customer base and their distribution among many industries and geographic locations 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to foreign exchange contracts in the event of non performance by the counter parties to these financial instruments 
we believe that the risk of incurring material losses related to this credit risk is remote 
we do not require collateral to support the financial position of our credit risks 
guarantee of indebtedness of others on february   we sold our equity interest in sunbelt to olin for million in cash and the assumption by olin of the obligations under our guarantee of senior secured notes issued by sunbelt of million at the time of sale  million as of december  until the guarantee is formally assigned to olin  we remain obligated under the guarantee  although olin has agreed to indemnify us for amounts that we may be obligated to pay under the guarantee 
letters of credit our revolving credit facility makes up to million available for the issuance of letters of credit  million of which was used at december  these letters of credit are issued by the bank in favor of third parties and are mainly related to insurance claims 
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our obligations under debt agreements  operating leases  interest obligations  pension and other post retirement plan obligations and purchase obligations as of december  payment due by period in millions total thereafter total debt operating leases interest on long term debt obligations pension and post retirement obligations purchase obligations total total debt includes both the current and long term portions of debt  excluding unamortized original issue discounts of million  as reported in note  financing arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
represents estimated contractual interest payments for all short term and long term debt 
we estimated the cash payments for interest associated with our term loan by using the actual rate in effect   as of december  pension and post retirement obligations relate to our us and international pension and other post retirement plans 
the expected payments associated with these plans represent an actuarial estimate of future assumed payments based upon retirement and payment patterns 
future payments also include a million voluntary payment expected to be made in due to uncertainties regarding the assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our pension and non pension postretirement benefit plans  including i interest rate levels  ii the amount and timing of asset returns and iii what  if any  changes may occur in pension funding legislation  the estimates in the table may differ materially from actual future payments 
purchase obligations are primarily comprised of service agreements related to telecommunication  information technology  utilities and other manufacturing plant services and certain capital commitments 
the table also excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits  since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
at december   the gross liability for unrecognized income tax benefits  including interest and penalties  totaled million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k other than the sunbelt debt guarantee described previously in the guarantee of indebtedness of others section 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies are described more fully in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable considering the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and polyone corporation use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions pension and other post retirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement plans in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses  after consideration of inventory capitalization  in our operating results in the year in which the gains or losses occur 
in  we recognized a million loss as a result of the recognition of these actuarial losses  which adversely impacted our statement of income  statement of comprehensive income  and the funded status of our pension and other post retirement plans 
these losses were mainly driven by lower than expected discount rates  slightly offset by actual asset returns exceeding our expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the value of future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to the volatility of market conditions 
to develop our discount rate  we consider the yields of high quality  fixed income investments with maturities that correspond to the timing of our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected long term return on plan assets  we consider our historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets was for and for and the weighted average discount rates used to value our pension and other post retirement liabilities as of december  and were and  respectively 
as of december   an increase decrease in the discount rate of basis points  holding all other assumptions constant  would have increased or decreased pre tax income and the related pension and post retirement liability by approximately million 
an increase decrease in the discount rate of basis points as of december  would result in a change of approximately million in the net periodic benefit cost 
as we recognize returns on our plan assets based upon the actual returns of these assets through a mark to market adjustment that is recorded in the fourth quarter  no sensitivity analysis for a one percentage increase decrease in our expected long term return on plan assets has been provided 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we follow the guidance in asc  intangibles goodwill and other  and test goodwill for impairment at least annually  absent a triggering event that would warrant an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of the first day of october of each year 
we have identified our reporting units at the operating segment level or in some cases one level below the operating segment level 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
we estimated fair value using the best information available to us  including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding projected economic and market conditions  growth rates  operating margins and cash expenditures 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges 
based on our annual impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the corresponding carrying value by at least 
in connection with the acquisition of colormatrix  we identified million of acquired in process research and development ipr d 
identified ipr d acquired in a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the project is complete 
upon completion projects are reclassified to technology and amortized over their useful lives 
ipr d consists of two projects that we expect to complete during we estimate fair value using the best information available to us  including deriving relevant discounted cash flow projections for each asset and then deducting appropriate returns for other assets contributing to the generation of cash flows using a multi period excess earnings approach  which is a variant of the income approach 
the excess earnings approach requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding the probability of technical and regulatory success for each ipr d project  returns for other assets contributing to the generation of cash flows  costs to complete each project  tax rates attributable to each asset  projected economic and market conditions  growth rates  and operating margins 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to impairment charges related to these ipr d projects 
polyone corporation description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions at december   our consolidated balance sheet reflected million of indefinite lived trade name assets  which includes  million associated with the trade name acquired as part of the acquisition of gls and million associated with trade names acquired as part of the colormatrix acquisition 
we estimate the fair value of trade names using a relief from royalty payments approach 
this approach involves two steps estimating reasonable royalty rate for the trade name and applying this royalty rate to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
fair value is then compared with the carrying value of the trade name 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to impairment charges related to our indefinite lived trade names 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under asc under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in addition  deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets is not deemed to be more likely than not 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate recovery of certain of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income that we will ultimately generate in the future and other factors such as the interpretation of tax laws 
this means that significant estimates and judgments are required to determine the extent that valuation allowances should be provided against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances as of december  aggregating to million against such assets based on our current assessment of future operating results and these other factors 
at december   the gross liability for unrecognized income tax benefits  including interest and penalties  totaled million 
although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  which could result in income tax expense or benefits that could be material 
we recognize net tax benefits under the recognition and measurement criteria of asc topic  income taxes  which prescribes requirements and other guidance for financial statement recognition and measurement of positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns 
we record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
environmental liabilities based upon estimates prepared by our environmental engineers and consultants  we have million accrued at december  to cover probable future environmental remediation expenditures 
this accrual represents our best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs based upon information and technology currently available and our view of the most likely remedy 
depending upon the results of future testing  the ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken  changes in regulations  new information  newly discovered conditions and other factors  it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued 
however  such additional costs  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
our estimate of this liability may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
changes during the past five years have primarily resulted from changes in the estimate of future remediation costs at existing sites and payments made each year for remediation costs that were already accrued 
if further developments or resolution of these matters are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period 
polyone corporation description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions share based compensation we have share based compensation plans that include non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights sars 
see note  share based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  future forfeiture rates and risk free rates of return 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
we determined the fair value of the sars granted in based on a monte carlo simulation method 
for sars granted during and  the option pricing model used was the black scholes method 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates on debt obligations and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use these derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate exposure interest on our million term loan is currently based upon libor subject to a floor plus a margin 
interest on our revolving credit facility is currently based upon libor  plus a margin 
all other debt is at fixed rates 
there would be no impact on our interest expense or cash flows from either a increase or decrease in market rates of interest on our outstanding variable rate debt as of december   because libor is more than below the floor on our term loan and we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
foreign currency exposure we enter into intercompany lending transactions that are denominated in various foreign currencies and are subject to financial exposure from foreign exchange rate movement from the date a loan is recorded to the date it is settled or revalued 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts  which had a fair value of less than million at december  gains and losses on these contracts generally offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
when translating results from foreign operations into us dollars  we are subject to foreign exchange related risks in our operating results 
to mitigate this risk we enter into foreign exchange option contracts 
the fair value of the foreign exchange option contracts at december  was million 
we face translation risks related to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
net sales and expenses in our foreign operations foreign currencies are translated into varying amounts of us dollars depending upon whether the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our net sales and expenses from foreign operations as expressed in us dollars
