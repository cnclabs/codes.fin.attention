overview lumos networks is a fiber based network service provider in the mid atlantic region with a network of long haul fiber  metro ethernet and ethernet rings located primarily in virginia and west virginia  and portions of pennsylvania  maryland  ohio and kentucky 
we serve carrier  business and residential customers over our fiber network offering data  voice and ip services 
our principal products and services include metro ethernet  which provides ethernet connectivity among multiple locations in the same city or region over our fiber optic network  high capacity private line and wavelength services  which provide a means to utilize fiber in broadband applications and provide high capacity bandwidth  ip services and business and residential telephone local and long distance services 
our primary objective is to leverage our fiber assets to capture the continued rapid growth in demand for data and mobility services amongst our enterprise and carrier customers in the second and third tier markets we serve 
central to our strategy is being first to the regional markets with advanced technology and products that are attractive to regional enterprise customers seeking high quality data and ip services and interconnection to data carriers in the region and to carriers with needs in our markets for transport and fiber to the cell site services 
our overall strategy is to i maximize the value of our  mile long haul fiber optic network to expand the sale of data and ip services to new and existing enterprise and government customers while maintaining a ratio of approximately to on net traffic  ii leverage our fiber network to expand to new fiber to the cell site opportunities  iii utilize our fiber footprint and carrier relationships to expand our revenue in transport  iv continue to provide high quality customer service and a compelling value proposition  v continue to shift incremental resources from the declining legacy voice products into our faster growing and more profitable strategic data products in the competitive segment of our business  vi use our edge out strategy to expand into new adjacent geographic markets to further leverage our fiber network and growing offering of data services  and vii use our success based investment strategy to improve capital efficiency and expand margins 
our strategic data products  which provided approximately of our total revenue in and represent the main growth opportunity and the key focal point of our strategy  include our enterprise data  carrier data  fiber to the cell site fttc and ip services product lines 
these businesses  in the aggregate  also typically carry higher margins than many of our other product lines 
a majority of our capital expenditures and the focus of our sales force have more recently been and will continue to be dedicated to expanding revenue and profit from our strategic data products 
we believe that a balanced split between enterprise and carrier revenue results in the most effective capital allocation and resulting profitability 
the remaining of our total revenue in was generated from legacy voice and access products 
these businesses  in the aggregate  require limited incremental capital or personnel investment and deliver reasonably predictable cash flows 
it is our belief that revenue from these legacy businesses  in the aggregate  will continue to decline at an annual rate of approximately 
this decline is the expected result of regulatory actions taken to reduce intra state tariffs  access line loss resulting from residential wireless substitution  technology changes  the effect of current economic conditions on businesses and product replacement by competitive voice service offerings from cable operators in our markets 
despite the declining revenues  it is expected that the cash flows from these businesses will continue to be a significant contributor to funding the capital expenditures required for our higher growth and higher margin strategic data businesses

prior to and in connection with the business separation  following the market close on october   ntelos effectuated a for reverse stock split of its shares of common stock 
the spin off of lumos networks was in the form of a tax free stock distribution to ntelos s stockholders of record as of the close of business on october   the record date 
on october   ntelos distributed one share of lumos networks common stock for every share of ntelos common stock outstanding  on a post reverse stock split basis 
we have been publicly traded on nasdaq under the ticker symbol lmos since november  financial data included in this form k reflects lumos networks as a standalone public company 
revenue includes services sold to the ntelos wireless segment that was previously eliminated  which amounted to million for the period january  through october  and million for the year ended december  expenses include items previously unallocated by ntelos  inclusive of legal and professional fees  equity based compensation expense and certain expenses related to acquisitions 
these additional expenses for the period january  through october  totaled million and for the year ended december  totaled million inclusive of million of fibernet acquisition costs 

table of contents on december   we closed on a purchase agreement with one communications corp 
to acquire its fibernet business for net cash consideration of approximately million 
the fiber optic network acquired in this transaction covers all of west virginia and extends into surrounding areas in ohio  maryland  pennsylvania  virginia and kentucky  and provided us with further diversity and density in several of our existing markets  particularly in west virginia 
the former fibernet business offered retail voice and data services and transport and ip based services primarily to regional retail and wholesale business customers 
business segments during  we had two reportable business segments competitive and rlec 
our competitive business serves virginia  west virginia  and portions of pennsylvania  maryland  kentucky and ohio over an approximately  mile long haul fiber network as of december  revenues from the competitive segment accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pro forma to include the fibernet acquisition for the year ended december   the competitive segment accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
the competitive segment derives revenue from three key product groups strategic data  legacy voice and access 
the products underlying strategic data are enterprise data  carrier data  fiber to the cell site and ip services 
strategic data products are sold primarily to enterprise customers and carrier customers and represent the main growth opportunity and the key focal point of our strategy 
we market and sell these services primarily to business  government and carrier customers 
legacy voice and access revenues have and will continue to decline as a result of the continuing commoditization of legacy voice products  the increasing use of wireless devices and recent regulatory actions 
in  we achieved sequential year over year revenue growth of for our strategic data products  which represented approximately of our total revenues for this growth was achieved primarily through increases in customer bandwidth demand  an approximate increase in the number of on net buildings and by more than doubling our fiber to the cell sites in we have added experienced sales resources to improve our market penetration and facilitate the sale of our data and ip based services  including sales resources focused on obtaining long term fiber to the cell site contracts with wireless carriers that are deploying g data services 
these contracts will enable us to provide high speed transport from those sites to switching locations 
we had fiber deployed to towers at december  and we exited with fiber to towers 
in addition to reallocating our sales resources to focus on growing data revenue by driving enterprise data and carrier data sales in our footprint  we also took certain cost reduction measures in intended to increase our ability to fund our capital investment in our data businesses 
specifically  in the fourth quarter of  we completed a cost reduction plan that involved a reduction of approximately of our workforce primarily in our legacy businesses  consolidation of certain facilities and freezing the accumulation of benefits under certain postretirement plans 
we incurred restructuring charges of million in in connection with this plan  consisting of employee severance and termination benefits of million and lease termination costs of million see note in part ii
