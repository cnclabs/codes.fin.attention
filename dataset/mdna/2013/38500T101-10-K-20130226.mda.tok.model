glossary of oil and gas terms in this document  the abbreviations set forth below have the following meanings bbl barrel mcf thousand cubic feet mbbl thousand barrels mmcf million cubic feet mmbbl million barrels bcf billion cubic feet boe barrels of oil equivalent mmbtu million british thermal units mmboe million barrels of oil equivalent ngl natural gas liquids boepd barrels of oil equivalent per day nar net after royalty bopd barrels of oil per day ngl volumes are converted to boe on a one to one basis with oil 
gas volumes are converted to boe at the rate of mcf of gas per bbl of oil  based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil 
the rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship between oil and gas prices 
in the discussion that follows we discuss our interests in wells and or acres in gross and net terms 
gross oil and natural gas wells or acres refer to the total number of wells or acres in which we own a working interest 
net oil and natural gas wells or acres are determined by multiplying gross wells or acres by the working interest that we own in such wells or acres 
working interest refers to the interest we own in a property  which entitles us to receive a specified percentage of the proceeds of the sale of oil and natural gas  and also requires us to bear a specified percentage of the cost to explore for  develop and produce that oil and natural gas 
a working interest owner that owns a portion of the working interest may participate either as operator  or by voting its percentage interest to approve or disapprove the appointment of an operator  in drilling and other major activities in connection with the development of a property 
we also refer to royalties and farm in or farm out transactions 
royalties include payments to governments on the production of oil and gas  either in kind or in cash 
royalties also include overriding royalties paid to third parties 
our reserves  production volumes and sales are reported net after deduction of royalties 
production volumes are also reported net of inventory adjustments 
farm in or farm out transactions refer to transactions in which a portion of a working interest is sold by an owner of an oil and gas property 
the transaction is labeled a farm in by the purchaser of the working interest and a farm out by the seller of the working interest 
payment in a farm in or farm out transaction can be in cash or in kind by committing to perform and or pay for certain work obligations 
in the petroleum industry  geologic settings with proven petroleum source rocks  migration pathways  reservoir rocks and traps are referred to as petroleum systems 
several items that relate to oil and gas operations  including aeromagnetic and aerogravity surveys  seismic operations and several kinds of drilling and other well operations  are also discussed in this document 
aeromagnetic and aerogravity surveys are a remote sensing process by which data is gathered about the subsurface of the earth 
an airplane is equipped with extremely sensitive instruments that measure changes in the earth gravitational and magnetic field 
variations as small as  th in the gravitational and magnetic field strength and direction can indicate structural changes below the ground surface 
these structural changes may influence the trapping of hydrocarbons 
these surveys are an efficient way of gathering data over large regions 
seismic data is used by oil and natural gas companies as the principal source of information to locate oil and natural gas deposits  both for exploration for new deposits and to manage or enhance production from known reservoirs 
to gather seismic data  an energy source is used to send sound waves into the subsurface strata 
these waves are reflected back to the surface by underground formations  where they are detected by geophones which digitize and record the reflected waves 
computer software applications are then used to process the raw data to develop an image of underground formations 
d seismic is the standard acquisition technique used to image geologic formations over a broad area 
d seismic data is collected by a single line of energy sources which reflect seismic waves to a single line of geophones 
when processed  d seismic data produces an image of a single vertical plane of sub surface data 
d seismic data is collected using a grid of energy sources  which are generally spread over several square miles 
a d seismic survey produces a three dimensional image of the subsurface geology by collecting seismic data along parallel lines and creating a cube of information that can be divided into various planes  thus improving visualization 
consequently  d seismic data is generally considered a more reliable indicator of potential oil and natural gas reservoirs in the area evaluated 
wells drilled are classified as exploration  development  injector or stratigraphic 
an exploration well is a well drilled in search of a previously undiscovered hydrocarbon bearing reservoir 
a development well is a well drilled to develop a hydrocarbon bearing reservoir that is already discovered 
exploration and development wells are tested during and after the drilling process to determine if they have oil or natural gas that can be produced economically in commercial quantities 
if they do  the well will be completed for production  which could involve a variety of equipment  the specifics of which depend on a number of technical geological and engineering considerations 
if there is no oil or natural gas a dry well  or there is oil and natural gas but the quantities are too small and or too difficult to produce  the well will be abandoned 
abandonment is a completion operation that involves closing or plugging the well and remediating the drilling site 
an injector well is a development well that will be used to inject fluid into a reservoir to increase production from other wells 
a stratigraphic well is a drilling effort  geologically directed  to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition 
these wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production 
the classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration 
stratigraphic tests are classified as exploratory type if drilled in an unknown area or development type if drilled in a known area 
workover is a term used to describe remedial operations on a previously completed well to clean  repair and or maintain the well for the purpose of increasing or restoring production 
it could include well deepening  plugging portions of the well  working with cementing  scale removal  acidizing  fracture stimulation  changing tubulars or installing changing equipment to provide artificial lift 
the sec definitions related to oil and natural gas reserves  per regulation s x  reflecting our use of deterministic reserve estimation methods  are as follows reserves 
reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible  as of a given date  by application of development projects to known accumulations 
in addition  there must exist  or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist  the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production  installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market  and all permits and financing required to implement the project 
proved oil and gas reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
i 
the area of the reservoir considered as proved includes a 
the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and b 
adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
ii 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering  or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
iii 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering  or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
iv 
reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including  but not limited to  fluid injection are included in the proved classification when a 
successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based  and b 
the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
v 
existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
probable reserves 
probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which  together with proved reserves  are as likely as not to be recovered 
i 
when deterministic methods are used  it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves 
when probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates 
ii 
probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain  even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion 
probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir 
iii 
probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves 
iv 
see also guidelines in paragraphs a iv and a vi of section a of regulations s x 
possible reserves 
possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves 
i 
when deterministic methods are used  the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves 
when probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates 
ii 
possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain 
frequently  this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project 
iii 
possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves 
iv 
the proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented  including comparisons to results in successful similar projects 
v 
possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore  and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known proved reservoir 
possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir 
vi 
pursuant to paragraph a iii of section a of regulations s x  where direct observation has defined a hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the hko only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology 
portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations 
reasonable certainty 
if deterministic methods are used  reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered 
a high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not  and as changes due to increased availability of geoscience geological  geophysical and geochemical  engineering and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery eur with time  reasonably certain eur is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease 
deterministic estimate 
the method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter from the geoscience  engineering  or economic data in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure 
probabilistic estimate 
the method of estimating reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter from the geoscience  engineering or economic data is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrences 
developed oil and gas reserves 
developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered i 
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well  and ii 
through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
i 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances 
ii 
undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances  justify a longer time 
iii 
under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir  as defined in paragraph a of section a of regulation s x  or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty 
part i item business general gran tierra energy inc together with its subsidiaries gran tierra  us  our  or we is an independent international energy company engaged in oil and gas acquisition  exploration  development and production

the telephone number at our principal executive office is all dollar amounts referred to in this annual report on form k are united states us dollars  unless otherwise indicated 
development of our business our company was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on june   originally under the name goldstrike inc we made our initial acquisition of oil and gas producing and non producing properties in argentina in september since then  we have acquired oil and gas producing and non producing assets in colombia  peru  argentina and brazil  with our largest acquisitions being the acquisition of solana resources limited solana in and petrolifera petroleum limited petrolifera in in in colombia  we added two blocks through the colombia bid round and continued to focus on developing our producing fields  including costayaco and moqueta  and on the generation of exploration prospects  in brazil  we acquired the remaining working interest in our rec ncavo basin blocks  received declaration of commerciality for the ti field and received regulatory approval for the farm out of block bm cal in the offshore camamu basin  in peru  perupetro signed the assignment documents for block  officially transferring of the block and operatorship to us and we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining working interest in this block  we commenced drilling an exploration well on block  and  in blocks and  increased our working interest from to  subject to regulatory approval  and  subsequent to year end  assumed operatorship  in argentina  we continued to focus on developing our producing fields  including the surubi  puesto morales and rinconada norte fields 
in the year ended december   we incurred capital expenditures of million excluding changes in non cash working capital and including the million acquisition in brazil and net of proceeds from disposition of oil and gas properties  including acquisitions of million  drilling expenditures of million  facilities expenses of million  geological and geophysical g g expenses of million and other expenditures of million

we have interests in blocks in colombia  and are the operator in blocks 
the chaza  guayuyaco  garibay  and santana blocks have producing oil wells 
the magangu and sierra nevada blocks each have one producing gas well 
during the year ended december   of our consolidated production  nar adjusted for inventory changes  was from the chaza block 
in  we were awarded two exploration blocks  sinu and sinu in the sinu basin  in the colombia bid round 
royalties colombian royalties are established under law of all discoveries made subsequent to the enactment of this law have the sliding scale royalty described below 
discoveries made before the enactment of this law have a royalty of 
the agencia nacional de hidrocarburos national hydrocarbons agency anh contracts to which gran tierra is a party all have royalties that are based on a sliding scale described in law this royalty works on an individual oil field basis starting with a base royalty rate of for gross production of less than  bopd 
the royalty increases in a linear fashion from to for gross production between  and  bopd  and is stable at for gross production between  and  bopd 
for gross production between  and  bopd the rate increases in a linear fashion from to 
for gross production in excess of  bopd the royalty rate is fixed at 
the llanos block has an additional royalty of 
for gas fields  the royalty is on an individual gas field basis starting with a base royalty rate of for gross production of less than mmcf of gas per day 
the royalty increases in a linear fashion from to for gross production between mmcf of gas per day and bcf of gas per day  and is stable at for gross production between to  mmcf of gas per day 
for gross production between to bcf of gas per day the rate increases in a linear fashion from to 
for gross production in excess of bcf of gas per day the royalty rate is fixed at 
our production from the costayaco field is also subject to an additional royalty the hpr royalty that applies when cumulative gross production from a commercial field is greater than five mmbbl 
this additional royalty is calculated on the difference between a trigger price defined by the anh and the sales price 
as the chaza block exploration and production contract the chaza contract stands currently  any new exploitation area on this anh contracted block will also be subject to this additional royalty once the production from each new field exceeds five mmbbl of cumulative production 
the moqueta discovery in the chaza block and the jilguero discovery in the garibay block will both be subject to this additional royalty after each field produces five mmbbl 
the anh has requested that the additional royalty be paid with respect to production from the recently drilled wells relating to the moqueta discovery and has initiated a noncompliance procedure under the chaza contract 
the moqueta discovery is not located in the costayaco exploitation area 
further  we view the costayaco field and the moqueta discovery as two clearly separate and independent hydrocarbon accumulations 
therefore  it is our view that it is clear that  pursuant to the chaza contract  the additional compensation payments are only to be paid with respect to production from the moqueta wells when the accumulated oil production from any new exploitation area created with respect to the moqueta discovery exceeds five mmbbl 
discussions with the anh have not resolved this issue and we have initiated the dispute resolution process and filed an arbitration claim 
as at december   total cumulative production from the moqueta field was mmbbl 
the estimated compensation which would be payable on cumulative production to date if the anh s interpretation is successful is million 
for exploration and production contracts awarded in the and colombia bid rounds  including such contracts awarded to gran tierra  the high price royalty will apply once the production from the area governed by the contract  rather than any particular exploitation area designated under the contract  exceeds five mmbbl of cumulative production 
we expect that this criteria for the high price royalty will apply for subsequent bid rounds 
the santana and magangu blocks have a flat royalty as those discoveries were made before the guayuyaco and rio magdalena blocks have the sliding scale royalty but do not have the additional royalty 
in addition to these government royalties  gran tierra s original interests in the santana  guayuyaco  chaza  rio magdalena  mecaya and azar blocks acquired on our entry into colombia in are subject to a third party royalty 
the additional interest in guayuyaco and chaza acquired by gran tierra on the acquisition of solana in is not subject to this third party royalty 
on june   gran tierra entered into a participation agreement that would effectively compensate crosby capital  llc crosby for its share in certain colombian properties 
the compensation is in the form of overriding royalty rights that applies to production from historical properties 
the historical properties are santana  guayuyaco  rio magdalena  talora sold  chaza  primavera relinquished  mecaya and azar 
the overriding royalty rights starts with a rate on working interest production less government royalties 
for new commercial fields discovered within years of the agreement date and after a prescribed threshold is reached  crosby reserves the right to convert the overriding royalty rights to a net profit interest 
this net profit interest ranges from to of working interest production less sliding scale government royalties  as described above  and operating and overhead costs 
no adjustment is made for the hpr royalty 
on certain pre existing fields  crosby does not have the right to convert its overriding royalty rights to a net profit interest 
the overriding royalty rights and net profit interests are calculated on gran tierra s working interest production after royalties  excluding the working interest acquired from solana 
in addition  there is a conditional overriding royalty rights that applies only to the pre existing fields

the puesto morales  puesto morales este  rinconada norte  rinconada sur  surubi  el chivil  palmar largo and el vinalar blocks have producing oil wells and the puesto morales block also has producing gas wells 
during the year ended december   of our consolidated production  nar adjusted for inventory changes  was from the puesto morales block and was from the surubi block 
for all of our blocks in argentina  upon expiry of the block rights  ownership of producing assets will revert to the provincial government 
as some of our oil production in argentina is trucked to a local refinery  sales of oil in the noroeste basin can be seasonally delayed by adverse weather and road conditions  particularly during the months november through february when the area is subject to periods of heavy rain and flooding 
while storage facilities are designed to accommodate ordinary disruptions without curtailing production  delayed sales will delay revenues and may adversely impact our working capital position in argentina 
we relinquished our interest in the puesto guevara block during royalties in argentina are based on a provincial royalty plus an additional provincial turnover tax 
the provincial royalty rate is for the puesto morales este block and on all other blocks in argentina 
the provincial turnover tax ranges from to on our blocks 
rio negro province  which includes the puesto morales  puesto morales este  rinconada norte and rinconada sur blocks  has enacted new legislation that changes the royalty regime associated with concession agreement extensions 
royalties in rio negro province will increase a minimum of and a required bonus payment  not determinable at this time  will be negotiated for the concession agreement extension 
in addition  there is an additional royalty component of per dollar per bbl on realized oil prices greater than per bbl and per dollar per mmbtu for gas prices above per mmbtu 
under the new legislation  negotiations are required to be carried out within the first half of and the resulting new terms are expected to come into effect immediately thereafter

reserves the following table sets forth our reserves as of december  the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment  as discussed in item a 
risk factors 
the reserve estimation process requires us to use significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each property 
therefore the accuracy of the reserve estimate is dependent on the quality of the data  the accuracy of the assumptions based on the data  and the interpretations and judgment related to the data 
we have developed internal policies for estimating and evaluating reserves 
the policies we have developed are applied company wide  and are comprehensive in nature 
gran tierra s internal controls over reserve estimates include reconciliation and review controls  including an independent internal review of assumptions used in the estimation by our reserves committee  and of our reserves are evaluated by an independent reservoir engineering firm  glj petroleum consultants ltd  at least annually 
the primary internal technical person in charge of overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates is the general manager of engineering and development planning 
he has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and is a professional engineer and member of the association of professional engineers  geologists and geophysicists of alberta 
he is responsible for our engineering activities including reserves reporting  asset evaluation  reservoir management  and field development 
he has over years of industry experience in various domestic and international engineering and management roles 
the technical person responsible for overseeing the reserves evaluation is a vice president  corporate evaluations of glj petroleum consultants ltd 
he has a bachelor of science degree in engineering physics and is a registered professional engineer in the province of alberta 
he has over years of industry experience in various domestic and international engineering and management roles 
by applying our policies we have developed sec compliant reserve estimates and disclosures 
our policies are applied by all staff involved in generating and reporting reserve estimates including geological  engineering and finance personnel 
calculations and data are reviewed at multiple levels of the organization to ensure consistent and appropriate standards and procedures 
no estimates of reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in a report to any federal agency other than the sec

approximately of proved undeveloped reserves are located in our puesto morales field in argentina 
this field was acquired as a result of the petrolifera acquisition in additionally  approximately and of proved undeveloped reserves are in our moqueta and costayaco fields in colombia 
none of our proved undeveloped reserves at december   have remained undeveloped for five years or more since initial disclosure as proved reserves and we have adopted a development plan which indicates that the proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial disclosure as proved reserves 
significant changes in proved undeveloped reserves are summarized in the table below oil equivalent mmboe balance  december  purchases discoveries and extensions converted to proved producing technical revisions balance  december  in  we converted mmboe  or of the total year end proved undeveloped reserves  to developed status 
in  we made investments  consisting solely of capital expenditures  of million in colombia and million in argentina associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves 
approximately of proved undeveloped reserves conversions occurred in the costayaco and moqueta fields in colombia and in the puesto morales field in argentina 
the majority of proved undeveloped conversions occurred as a result of ongoing development activities in the costayaco and moqueta fields in colombia  including infill drilling and a pressure maintenance project in the costayaco field and infill drilling and facilities development in the moqueta field 
the waterflood optimization program for the sierra blancas reservoir and the commencement of a horizontal well development program for the loma montosa reservoir  both in the puesto morales field in argentina  also converted proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
sensitivity of reserves to prices by principal product type and price scenario the following table sets forth our reserves as at december   using different price cases involving changes to the brent price 
firstly with a increase and secondly with a decrease 
natural gas prices are not affected by brent  therefore the volumes of natural gas reserves do not change 
additionally  the oil price in argentina is set by the government as described below under the caption marketing and major customers 
oil prices in argentina are not sensitive to changes in brent prices  therefore the price scenarios considered do not result in changes to oil and natural gas reserves for argentina 
cost schedules were held constant for the two price cases 
proved reserves probable reserves possible reserves price case liquids natural gas liquids natural gas liquids natural gas mbbl mmcf mbbl mmcf mbbl mmcf brent colombia argentina brazil brent colombia argentina brazil proved and possible liquid reserves are higher as a result of a decrease in brent as compared with a increase in brent 
the lower price results in reduced additional government and third party royalties paid  increasing the nar volumes 
production revenue and price history certain information concerning oil and natural gas production  prices  revenues and operating expenses for the three years ended december   is set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the unaudited supplementary data provided following our financial statements in item  which information is incorporated by reference here

business strategy our plan is to continue to build an international oil and gas company through acquisition and exploitation of under developed prospective oil and gas assets  and to develop these assets with exploration and development drilling to grow commercial reserves and production 
our initial focus is in select countries in south america  currently colombia  argentina  peru  and brazil  we will consider other regions for future growth should those regions make strategic and commercial sense in creating additional value 
we have applied a two stage approach to growth  initially establishing a base of production  development and exploration assets by selective acquisitions  and secondly achieving additional reserve and production growth through drilling 
we intend to duplicate this business model in other areas as opportunities arise 
we pursue opportunities in countries with proven petroleum systems  attractive royalty  taxation and other fiscal terms  and stable legal systems 
a key to our business plan is positioning and being in the right place at the right time with the right resources 
the fundamentals of this strategy are described in more detail below position in countries that are welcoming to foreign investment  that provide attractive fiscal terms  that have stable legal systems  that offer opportunities that we believe have been previously ignored or undervalued  and that have an active market with many available deals  build a balanced portfolio of production  development and exploration assets and opportunities  with a drilling inventory that balances risks and rewards to create value  retain operatorship of assets whenever possible to retain control of work programs  budgets  prospect generation  drilling operations and development activities  non operating positions will be taken when operators bring strategic advantage to business growth  engage qualified  experienced and motivated professionals  establish an effective local presence  with strong constructive relationships with host governments  ministries  agencies and communities in which we operate  consolidate land and properties in close proximity to build operating efficiency  and manage asset and drilling portfolios closely  assessing value to the company and making changes where needed 
research and development we have not expended any resources on pursuing research and development initiatives 
we use existing technology and processes for executing our business plan 
marketing and major customers colombia our oil in colombia is good quality light oil  with of production coming from the putumayo basin with an average api of to 
ecopetrol is the purchaser of most of our colombia crude oil production and the source of the majority of our revenues 
sales to ecopetrol accounted for  and  of our consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
we have entered into agreements to sell to ecopetrol the volume of crude oil production produced in the chaza block  santana block and guayuyaco block the putumayo production 
the volume of crude oil does not include the volume of oil owned by the anh corresponding to royalties  other than hpr royalties 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation periodically and generally contain mutual termination provisions with days notice 
the expiry dates of these agreements have been extended multiple times  and will expire november  in the event that ecopetrol does not accept a full delivery of this production  we may sell to another party the crude oil not accepted 
we deliver our oil to ecopetrol through our transportation facilities which include pipelines  gathering systems and trucking 
prior to the end of january  the sales point for our sales to ecopetrol of the putumayo production to be exported through the port of tumaco on the pacific coast of colombia was a point in the putumayo basin 
beginning in february  the sales point was changed to the port of tumaco 
due to the change in the sales point for putumayo production to the port of tumaco  we entered into crude oil transportation agreements with ecopetrol pursuant to which we pay to ecopetrol a transportation tariff and transportation tax for the transportation by ecopetrol of the putumayo production from the putumayo basin to the port of tumaco 
under these agreements  ecopetrol is liable for risk of loss of oil during transportation only if ecopetrol fails to take reasonable measures to operate the pipeline or is grossly negligent 
currently we have firm capacity transportation agreements for  bopd that are in place for eight years and the remainder of our putumayo production is transported through the spot agreements 
the later agreements are due to expire on june   but contemplate the transfer of pipeline assets to a wholly owned subsidiary of ecopetrol  cenit s 
a 
s 
cenit  at which time ecopetrol will assign the transportation agreements  as so amended  to cenit 
in the event ecopetrol does not accept a full delivery of our production  we have three alternative purchasers gunvor colombia sas gunvor  petrobras colombia limited petrobras colombia and one other short term customer 
sales to gunvor  petrobras colombia and the short term customer accounted for  and of our consolidated revenues during the year ended december   respectively 
during january  we sold approximately  bopd to gunvor 
we are under no obligation to sell any oil to gunvor until we specify for a particular day the amount of oil we wish to sell to them 
oil is delivered to gunvor at the costayaco battery and the sales point is where the oil is loaded into a truck at our loading facility 
the gunvor agreements will expire on december  oil is delivered to petrobras colombia at facilities at guaduas or vasconia station and this is the sales point 
we are under no obligation to sell any oil to petrobras colombia 
our third short term customer in colombia permits us to use excess capacity on their pipeline to transport our oil to the port of cove as up to a maximum of  bopd with no minimum volume obligation 
for this customer  the delivery point is when the oil is loaded into their trucks  but the sales point is when oil is loaded into their export tanker  which is subject to the export program and off take procedures of the port of cove as 
the majority of the oil produced is transported by pipeline 
varying amounts of oil are trucked from santana station to ecopetrol s storage terminal at orito  a distance of approximately kilometers  from the costayaco field to ecopetrol s storage terminal at neiva dina station  approximately kilometers north of the chaza block  from the costayaco field to the atl ntico oil terminal in barranquilla  a distance of approximately  kilometers  from the garibay field to facilities at vasconia station  a distance of approximately kilometers and during  from the costayaco field to our short term customer facilities at rio loro station  approximately kilometers north of the field 
oil prices for sales to ecopetrol are defined by agreements with ecopetrol based on a marker price generally the average export price for crude oil from the port of shipment with adjustments for quality and specified fees depending on the port  including a port operation fee and a commercialization fee  and a transportation fee and transportation tax 
oil prices for sales to gunvor are based on the average of wti prices plus a vasconia differential and premium  adjusted for trucking costs 
oil prices for sales to petrobras colombia are based on vasconia crude oil price less adjustments for quality  transportation  marketing and handling 
oil prices for sales to our additional short term purchaser are determined based on vasconia crude oil price less adjustments for quality  transportation  marketing and handling 
we receive revenues for our colombian oil sales in us dollars 
argentina we market our own share of production in argentina 
the purchaser of our oil in the noroeste basin of argentina is refineria del norte sa refinor 
our contract with refinor expired on january   however  we are continuing sales of our oil under monthly agreements with refinor 
in the noroeste basin  oil is delivered to the refinery by truck

competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we face competition from both local and international companies in acquiring properties  contracting for drilling and other oil field equipment and securing trained personnel 
many of these competitors have financial and technical resources that exceed ours  and we believe that these companies have a competitive advantage in these areas 
others are smaller  and we believe our technical and financial capabilities give us a competitive advantage over these companies 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment
