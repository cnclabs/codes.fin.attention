system solution net revenues from us distributors also declined as they reduced their overall inventory levels as part of their ongoing efforts to improve inventory management costs and operational efficiencies 
we believe distributor decisions are driven by a number of factors  including cost management efforts  which may cause distributors to alter their distribution models or inventory levels  timing of changes in standards  such as emv  which in turn impact timing of purchases from us  and each distributor perception of shifts in demand in their end markets

table of contents financial outlook we expect the timing and amount of overall revenue growth to continue to be impacted by factors such as the timing of new product releases and certifications  the timing of our customers technology refresh cycles particularly by our large customers  increased competition and pricing pressure  changes in distribution and distributor inventory levels  the impact of recent acquisitions  foreign currency fluctuations  and continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions in certain markets 
we expect the timing of new product releases to continue to have a significant impact on our net revenues  particularly in markets where we have experienced delays in some of our new product releases and certifications  and in countries that require lengthy certification processes 
net revenues can vary significantly when larger customers or distributors cancel or delay orders due to budget concerns  technology refresh cycles  and regulatory  certification or other requirements 
also  demand for electronic payment systems may eventually reach a saturation point  at which time customers might slow or end expansion projects 
we expect to generate net revenues in the us related to the emv standard that we expect will be adopted by our customers over the next several years 
we expect growth in emerging markets as economic conditions improve and those economies make efforts to modernize to cashless payment systems 
we expect that the markets in which we conduct our business will remain highly competitive  characterized by changing technologies  evolving industry standards  government regulations  pricing pressures  and increased demand for new functionality  premium services  mobility  and security 
market disruptions caused by new technologies  the entry of new competitors or the presence of strong local competition  consolidations among our customers and competitors  changes in regulatory requirements  timing of electronic payments initiatives that create demand for our products in emerging markets  and other factors  can introduce volatility into our business 
in the middle east and africa  which are emerging markets for our products and solutions  and where we have made some distribution changes  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience reduced levels of net revenues 
we expect to see a continued shift towards a higher proportion of services net revenues relative to total net revenues in fiscal year due to the continued development and sales of our services offerings 
as we transition to service oriented arrangements  we may experience a shift in the timing of system solutions net revenues depending on when all of our performance obligations are complete 
we also expect to see an overall long term growth in services net revenues as a result of our continuing development and sales of our services offerings globally 
for example  we are expanding the roll out of point all in one payment solution in select global markets  including south africa  australia  and new zealand  and have acquired services based businesses in europe and new zealand 
we expect that expansion of our services offerings will result in an overall long term shift towards a higher proportion of services net revenues recognized over multi year contract terms  which may decrease system solutions net revenues and near term total net revenues 
during fiscal year  we increased our level of spending on research and development activities and expect to continue at that increased level as we work to increase the efficiency of our r d operations and product development life cycle 
we also expect to continue to invest in marketing as we streamline our product portfolio  and we plan to continue efforts to improve our cost structure  including streamlining our general and administrative functions 
however  spending may increase near term depending on the costs of executing our business strategy  continuing to integrate past acquisitions  additional executive changes  any restructurings  and legal matters 
we expect there will be future shifts in the mix of pretax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction that will impact our effective tax rate and tax provision benefit in the future 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital  pay for contractual commitments  service our debt  and make capital expenditures and investments

in addition  million was available for draw on the revolving loan as of october  see note  financings  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our borrowings 
on october   the court entered an order preliminarily approving our stipulated settlement in the consolidated shareholder class action captioned in re verifone holdings  inc securities litigation  pursuant to which if the settlement becomes final  the total settlement consideration paid for the benefit of the settlement class would be million plus a potential contingent adjustment of not more than million 
to cover such settlement amount  on november   we paid million into an escrow account  which was partially funded from available credit under the revolving loan 
our insurance carriers paid the remaining million into that escrow account 
the potential contingent adjustment of not more than million will be due if certain circumstances occur on or before april  see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding this matter 
our future capital requirements may vary significantly from prior periods as well as from those capital requirements we have currently planned 
these requirements will depend on a number of factors  including operating factors such as our terms and payment experience with customers  the resolution of any legal proceedings against us or settlement of litigation in an amount in excess of our insurance coverage  and investments we may make in product or market development  as well as timing and availability of financing 
also  our capital needs may be significantly affected by any acquisition we may make in the future due to any cash consideration in the purchase price  related transaction costs  and related restructuring costs 
based upon our current level of operations  we believe that we have the financial resources to meet our business requirements for the next year  including capital expenditures  working capital requirements  future strategic investments  debt servicing costs and compliance with our financial covenants

financing proceeds also decreased million year over year because we issued fewer shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans in fiscal year  since fewer employees exercised their stock options due to our lower stock price in fiscal year the decrease was partially offset by a million decrease in payments for acquisition related contingent consideration and hold back amounts in fiscal year compared to fiscal year see note  business acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our acquisition related contingent consideration

table of contents the outstanding principal balance of the term a loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments of the following percentages of the original balance outstanding under the term a loan for each of the first eight calendar quarters after the effective date through the quarter ending december   for each of the next eight calendar quarters through the quarter ending december   and for each of the calendar quarters ending march   june  and september   with the balance being due at maturity on december  the outstanding principal balance of the term b loan is required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of with the balance being due at maturity on december  the revolving loan terminates on december  outstanding amounts may also be subject to mandatory prepayment with the proceeds of certain asset sales and debt issuances and  in the case of the term b loan only  from a portion of annual excess cash flows as determined under the credit agreement depending on verifone  inc leverage ratio 
the credit agreement also contains representations and warranties  affirmative covenants  negative covenants  financial covenants  and conditions that are customarily required for similar financings 
in addition  the borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in certain of our assets  subject to customary exceptions 
the interest rate of each of the term a loan and the revolving loan is currently one month libor plus the applicable margin  and the interest rate on the term b loan is currently the higher of one month libor or plus the applicable margin 
as of october   we elected the eurodollar rate margin option for our borrowings under the credit agreement  and the interest margins were for the term a loan and the revolving loan  and for the term b loan 
accordingly  as of october   the interest rate on the term a and revolving loan was  and the interest rate on the term b loan was 
as of october   the unused revolving loan facility commitment fee was per annum  payable quarterly in arrears  and the amount available to draw under the revolving loan was million 
we have outstanding a number of interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert million of our term a loan from a floating rate to a fixed rate plus applicable margin 
the interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment as cash flow hedges and are effective for the period from march  to march  contractual commitments contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  in thousands years ended october  thereafter total credit agreement capital lease obligations and other loans operating leases minimum purchase obligations total contractual obligations for the credit agreement include interest calculated using the rate in effect as of october  operating leases include million of minimum contractual obligations on leases for our taxi solutions business where payments are based upon the number of operational taxicabs with our advertising displays as of october  as of october   the amount payable for unrecognized tax benefits was million  including accrued interest and penalties  none of which is expected to be paid within one year 
this amount is included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of october  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with the applicable taxing authorities may occur  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table 

table of contents we expect that we will be able to fund our remaining obligations and commitments with future cash flows from our ongoing operations  and our million of cash and cash equivalents held as of october  to the extent we are unable to fund these obligations and commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations  we can draw upon amounts available under our credit agreement or future debt or equity financings 
bank guarantees we have issued bank guarantees to certain of our customers and vendors with maturities ranging from two months to six years as required in some countries to support certain performance obligations under our service or other agreements with these customers and vendors 
as of october   the maximum amount that may become payable under these guarantees was million  of which million is collateralized by restricted cash deposits 
letters of credit we provide standby letters of credit in the ordinary course of business to third parties as required 
as of october   the maximum amounts that may become payable under these letters of credit was million  of which million is collateralized by restricted cash deposits 
manufacturing agreements we work on a purchase order basis with our contract manufacturers  which are located in china  singapore  malaysia  brazil  germany  romania  and france  and component suppliers located throughout the world  to supply nearly all of our finished goods inventories  spare parts  and accessories 
we provide each such supplier with a purchase order to cover the manufacturing requirements  which generally constitutes a binding commitment by us to purchase materials and finished goods produced by the manufacturer as specified in the purchase order 
most of these purchase orders are considered to be non cancelable  and are expected to be paid within one year of the issuance date 
as of october   the amount of purchase commitments issued to contract manufacturers and component suppliers totaled approximately million 
of this amount  million has been recorded in accruals and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets because these commitments are not expected to have future value to us 
we utilize a limited number of third parties to manufacture our products  and rely upon these contract manufacturers to produce and deliver products on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost 
furthermore  a majority of our manufacturing activities are concentrated in china and brazil 
as a result  disruptions to the business or operations of the contract manufacturers or to their ability to produce the required products in a timely manner  and particularly disruptions to the manufacturing facilities located in china and brazil  could significantly impact our business and operations 
in addition  a number of components that are necessary to manufacture and assemble our systems are specifically customized for use in our products and are obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis 
because of the customized nature of these components and the limited number of available suppliers  if we were to experience a supply disruption  it would be difficult and costly to find alternative sources in a timely manner 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 

table of contents critical accounting polices and estimates general management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  principles of consolidation and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
business combinations we are required to estimate the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed of acquired companies 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies  and patents  expected costs to complete development of in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating the cash flows from those projects when completed  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  customer attrition rates and discount rates 
future expected cash flow to be generated from an acquired business is estimated based on the current financial performance of the business  then adjusted for expected market participant synergies that can be realized  the expected timing of future cash flows of all of the acquired business products and services  the expected customer attrition rates  and the future growth rates 
the higher the projected cash flows  the higher the value of intangible assets 
discount rates reflect the nature of our investment and the perceived risk of the underlying cash flows 
goodwill we review the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment annually on august and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our reporting units are north america  emea  lac  aspac  and taxi solutions 
our north america reporting unit is defined as our operations in the us and canada 
our lac reporting unit is defined as our operations in south and central america 
our taxi solutions reporting unit consists of our taxi media and payment solutions businesses 
our emea and aspac reporting units include the same operations as our reportable segments 
when assessing goodwill for impairment  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we perform a two step impairment test 
if  we conclude otherwise  then no further action is taken 
we also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and only perform a quantitative assessment  which is the first step of the two step impairment test 
in the two step impairment test  we measure the recoverability of goodwill by comparing a reporting unit carrying amount  including goodwill  to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

table of contents we generally select the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the dcf method calculates fair value by discounting estimated after tax cash flows to a present value  using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we believe this method is the most meaningful in conducting our goodwill assessments because we believe it most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
in applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill  we make certain assumptions as to the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates  and appropriate discount rates 
the amount and timing of future cash flows used in our dcf analysis is based on our most recent long term forecasts and the expected future financial performance of each reporting unit  including projections of net revenues  costs of net revenues  operating expenses  income taxes  working capital requirements  and capital expenditures 
a terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of the cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis 
the terminal value growth rate reflects our best estimates for stable  perpetual growth of our reporting units 
we use the weighted average cost of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows 
in addition  we make judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
different judgments or assumptions could result in different carrying values 
for our fiscal year annual impairment review  we compared the carrying amount of each of our five reporting units as of august  to their estimated fair value  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by amounts ranging from to 
our emea reporting unit  which was allocated million of goodwill  had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in past fiscal years  and our forecast of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we have operations 
we have placed a valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets and certain non us deferred tax assets  because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income does not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional tax expense in the period in which the increase is recognized 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from the estimates  the amount of the valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is based on detailed facts and circumstances of each issue 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
revenue recognition while the majority of our sales transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are some transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions  and  as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine whether an arrangement exists and what is included in the arrangement 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is probable  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
we enter into arrangements with customers that include multiple deliverables 
significant judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting for multiple element arrangements including whether elements represent separate deliverables  the estimated selling price esp for each deliverable  the arrangement consideration to be allocated among the deliverables  when to recognize net revenues on the deliverables  and whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements 
further  our determination of esp involves assessing factors such as the cost to produce the deliverable  the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the economic conditions and trends  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts  and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
warranty costs we accrue for estimated warranty obligations at the time that revenue is recognized  and base those accruals on an estimate of future warranty costs for the delivered product 
our warranty obligation generally extends from one to three years from the date of shipment 
we estimate such obligations based on the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection  historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected costs associated with claims  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of our typical experience 
our estimates and judgments are affected by actual product failure rates and actual costs to repair 
these estimates and judgments are more subjective for new product introductions as these estimates and judgments are based on our experience for similar products because we do not yet have actual history or experience for new products 
from time to time we encounter situations where our costs of warranty on a product vary significantly from expectations due to factors including defective parts  defective workmanship  or other unanticipated environmental or usage patterns 
when encountered  a specific reserve is established for these atypical situations on a case by case basis  and best available estimates are used to quantify the potential exposure 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation plans using fair value recognition and measurement principles  and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded in the period the awards are forfeited 
in valuing stock based awards  significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility and the expected term individuals will hold their stock based awards prior to exercising 
expected volatility of the stock is based on a blend of factors  such as the implied volatility of our options and the historical volatility of our own stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the historical actual term of option grants and an estimate of future exercises during the remaining contractual period of the option 
in the future  our expected volatility and expected term may change  which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and ultimately the expense we record 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their invoices to us in full 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  considering the size of each customer accounts receivable balance  their expected ability to pay  aging of their accounts receivable balances  and our collection history with them 
an appropriate provision is made taking into account these factors 
the level of reserves for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above  and could change significantly if their financial condition changes or the economy in general deteriorates 
inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers the valuation of inventories requires us to determine obsolete or excess inventory  and inventory that is not of salable quality 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventories requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally six months 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write offs  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin percentage 
we review the adequacy of our inventory valuation on a quarterly basis 
for production inventory  our methodology involves an assessment of the marketability of the product based on a combination of shipment history and future demand 
we then evaluate the inventory found to be in excess and take appropriate write downs to reflect the risk of obsolescence 
our evaluation depends on the accuracy of our sales estimates 
if actual demand was substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory write downs for excess or obsolete inventories may be required 
we record accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to orders placed with our suppliers that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled 
consistent with industry practice  we acquire inventory through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover our requirements for periods ranging from one to five months 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of our products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of our products  we may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect our results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 
long lived assets we make judgments about the recoverability of long lived assets  including fixed assets and purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of long lived assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of depreciation or amortization 
if circumstances arise that indicate an impairment may exist  we use an estimate of the undiscounted value of expected future operating cash flows to determine whether the long lived assets are impaired 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  the resulting impairment charge to be recorded is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over the fair value of such assets  with the fair value generally determined using the dcf method 
application of the dcf method for long lived assets requires judgment and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates  and appropriate discount rates 
different judgments or assumptions could result in materially different fair value estimates 
contingencies and litigation the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and subject to numerous factors outside of our control 
significant judgment is required when we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to a potential claim or legal proceeding  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  and when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable 
a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required  if any  for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each matter 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  we base our estimates on the information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation  and may revise our estimates 
any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements may be found in note  principles of consolidation and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k  which section is incorporated herein by reference 
we do not expect any of the recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve  and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our borrowings 
these borrowings generally bear interest based upon the one month libor rate 
as of october   a basis point increase in interest rates on our borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
we have outstanding a number of interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert million of the term a loan from a floating rate to a fixed rate plus applicable margin 
the interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment as cash flow hedges and are effective for the period from march  to march  we generally invest most of our cash in non interest bearing bank accounts 
however  some of the funds are placed in overnight and short term instruments  which would earn more interest income if market interest rates rise and less interest income if market interest rates fall 
foreign currency transaction risk a substantial majority of our sales are made to customers outside the us a substantial portion of the net revenues we generate from international sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our cost of net revenues and operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the euro  brazilian reais  british pound  and swedish krona 
for consolidated reporting  net revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which we refer to as income statement exposures  are translated to the us dollar at average currency exchange rates for the period 
thus  even if foreign operating results were stable  fluctuating currency rates may produce volatile reported results 
we have from time to time made efforts to mitigate income statement exposures by hedging with currency derivatives 
as of october  and  we had no derivatives designated as cash flow hedges related to income statement exposures 
we may in the future use foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge income statement exposures  depending upon the risks of the exposures  the costs of hedging  and other considerations 
however  hedges of income statement exposures will only mitigate a portion of our risk and only for a short period 
the balance sheets of our subsidiaries may have monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of such business  which we refer to as balance sheet exposures 
for example  our balance sheet exposures might include monetary assets and liabilities such as canadian dollar receivables held in a subsidiary where the canadian dollar is not the primary currency  such as our us business  or us dollar payables held by our us subsidiary 
as exchange rates fluctuate  balance sheet exposures generate foreign currency transaction gains and losses  which are included in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
most balance sheet exposures will settle in local currency or convert from a foreign currency to a local currency in the foreseeable future  at which time the impact of rate fluctuations will be realized and we will receive or dispense more or less cash than the value originally recorded 
we refer to such exposures as near term balance sheet exposures 
some balance sheet exposures may not be settled in the foreseeable future in management estimation and thus the cash impact of their currency gains or losses is not expected to be realized in the foreseeable future 
we have in the past and expect to continue in the future to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of near term balance sheet exposures 
our objective is to have gains or losses from the foreign exchange forward contracts largely offset the losses or gains of the near term balance sheet exposures 
on a monthly basis  we recognize the gains or losses based on the changes in fair value of these contracts in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
in some instances  we may seek to hedge transactions that are expected to become near term balance sheet exposures in the very short term  generally within one month 
we do not use foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of october  are presented in the table below in thousands 
the fair market value of the contracts represents the difference between the spot currency rate at october  and the contracted rate 
all of these forward contracts mature within days of october  currency local currency contract amount currency contracted amount fair market value at october  contracts to buy sell usd argentine peso ars usd australian dollar aud usd brazilian real brl usd canadian dollar cad usd chinese renminbi cny usd danish krone dkk usd euro eur usd british pound gbp usd israeli new shekel ils usd indian rupee inr usd south korean won krw usd mexican peso mxn usd new zealand dollar nzd usd norwegian kroner nok usd polish zloty pln usd south african rand zar usd swedish krona sek usd turkish lira try usd total fair market value as of october   our balance sheet exposures  which is the sum of the absolute value of the net assets or net liabilities for each of our foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar  amounted to million 
these balance sheet exposures were partially offset by foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional amount of million 
based on our net exposures as of october   a fluctuation in currency exchange rates would result in a gain or loss of approximately million 
as of october   we had one balance sheet exposure not expected to be paid in the near term  an israeli shekel payable equivalent to million 
excluding this exposure from the israeli subsidiary net liability exposure of million results in a million net asset position 
deducting the million absolute value difference from our total balance sheet exposures of million results in a total near term balance sheet exposure of million 
a movement in currency exchange rates would result in a gain or loss of approximately million that we would expect to be realized in the foreseeable future 
our efforts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in our balance sheet exposures through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts may not always be effective in protecting us against currency exchange rate fluctuations  particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of non us denominated assets and liabilities 
in addition  at times we have not fully offset our balance sheet exposures  leaving us at risk for foreign exchange gains and losses on amounts not offset by forward contracts 
furthermore  historically we have not consistently hedged our income statement exposures 
accordingly  if there were an adverse movement in exchange rates  we might suffer significant losses 

table of contents equity price risk there are outstanding warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of per share in equal share amounts on each trading day from december  to february  for every that the share price of our common stock exceeds  we will be required to issue the equivalent of million worth of shares of our common stock 
information on the share price of our common stock may be found under part ii item  market for registrant common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  of this annual report on form k
