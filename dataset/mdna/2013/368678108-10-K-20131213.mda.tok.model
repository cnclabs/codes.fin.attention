overview gencor industries  inc the company  is a leading manufacturer of heavy machinery used in the production of highway construction materials  synthetic fuels  and environmental control equipment 
the company s core products include asphalt plants  combustion systems and fluid heat transfer systems 
the company s products are manufactured in two facilities in the united states 
because the company s products are sold primarily to the highway construction industry  the business is seasonal in nature 
traditionally  the company s customers do not purchase new equipment for shipment during the summer and fall months to avoid disrupting their peak season for highway construction and repair work 
the majority of orders for the company s products are thus received between october and february  with a significant volume of shipments occurring prior to june 
the principal factors driving demand for the company s products are the overall economic conditions  the level of government funding for domestic highway construction and repair  infrastructure development in emerging economies  the need for spare parts  fluctuations in the price of crude oil liquid asphalt as well as fuel costs  and a trend towards larger plants resulting from industry consolidation 
in august  the federal government passed the safe  accountable  flexible and efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users safetea lu 
this bill appropriated a multi year guaranteed funding of billion for federal highway  transit and safety programs that expired on september  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  which included approximately billion for highway and bridge construction activities 
the arra and any future legislation approved by congress could reduce infrastructure funding levels 
in addition  funding restrictions can be imposed on states that do not comply with certain federal policies 
on march   president obama signed into law the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act 
this law extended authorization of the surface transportation programs previously funded under safetea lu through december  at levels 
in addition  the hire act authorized a one time transfer of billion from the general fund to the highway trust fund related to previously foregone interest payments 
on december   president obama signed into law the continuing appropriations and surface transportation extensions act  extending funding for federal surface transportation programs authorized under safetea lu through march  on march   president obama signed into law the surface transportation extension act of providing an extension of federal aid highway  transit and other programs funded out of the highway trust fund through september  on september   president obama signed an eighth extension of safetea lu  authorizing funding at levels through march   and on march   the president signed into law the surface transportation extension act of  a day extension of the existing federal transportation reauthorization 
the bill contained no policy changes and extended current programs and funding levels through june   pending enactment of a multi year law reauthorizing such programs 

table of contents on july   president obama signed a billion transportation bill  moving ahead for progress in the st century act map 
map includes a final three month extension of safetea lu at current spending levels combined with a new two year  billion authorization of the federal highway  transit  and safety programs effective october  the bill provides states with two years of funding to build roads  bridges  and transit systems 
the canadian government enacted major infrastructure stimulus programs which benefitted the company in prior years 
in  the building canada plan provided billion in infrastructure funding through as part of the building canada plan  the gas tax fund was approved in  providing billion in annual infrastructure spending 
the infrastructure canada plan provided billion in additional infrastructure funding from through the economic downturn over the past several years and the lack of a multi year federal highway bill have resulted in reduced purchasing within the company s served markets 
this had an adverse impact on sales and pricing pressures on the company s products  resulting in lower revenues and margins 
in addition to government funding and the overall economic conditions  fluctuations in the price of oil  which is a major component of asphalt mix  may affect the company s financial performance 
an increase in the price of oil increases the cost of liquid asphalt and could  therefore  decrease demand for asphalt and certain of the company s products 
increases in oil prices also drive up the cost of gasoline  which results in increased freight costs 
where possible  the company will pass increased freight costs on to its customers 
however  the company may not be able to recapture all of the increased costs and thus could have a negative impact on the company s financial performance 
steel is a major component used in manufacturing the company s equipment 
fluctuations in the price of steel can have a significant impact on the company s financial results 
where possible  the company will pass on increased steel costs to its customers 
however  the company may not be able to recapture all of the increased steel costs and thus its financial results could be negatively affected 
for the long term  the company believes the strategy of continuing to invest in product engineering and development and its focus on delivering a high quality product and superior service will strengthen the company s market position when demand for its products rebound 
in response to the short term outlook  the company has taken aggressive actions to conserve cash  right size its operations and cost structure  and will continue to do so based on its forecast 
these actions included adjustments to workforce  reduced purchases of raw materials and reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the company continues to review its internal processes to identify inefficiencies and cost reduction opportunities 
the company will continue to scrutinize its relationships with external suppliers to ensure it is achieving the highest quality materials and services at the most competitive cost

critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the company believes the following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting policies  in addition to the critical accounting policies referenced below  are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies 
estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company uses certain estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
estimates and assumptions are used  among other places  when accounting for certain revenue eg contract accounting  expense  and asset and liability valuations 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions made in preparing the consolidated financial statements are reasonable  but are inherently uncertain 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events may occur 
the company is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
revenues expenses revenues from contracts for the design  manufacture and sale of asphalt plants are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting for these contracts recognizes revenue  net of any promotional discounts  and costs in proportion to actual labor costs incurred as compared with total estimated labor costs expected to be incurred during the entire contract 
pre contract costs are expensed as incurred 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed is classified as current assets under costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
the company anticipates that all incurred costs associated with these contracts at september   will be billed and collected within one year 
revenues from all other contracts for the design and manufacture of custom equipment  for service and for parts sales  net of any discounts and return allowances  are recorded when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met product is delivered or service is performed  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
returns and allowances  which reduce product revenue  are estimated using historical experience 
provisions for estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
product warranty costs are estimated using historical experience and known issues and are charged to production costs as revenue is recognized 

table of contents all product engineering and development costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
provision is made for any anticipated contract losses in the period that the loss becomes evident 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by performing a specific review of all account balances greater than days past due and other higher risk amounts to determine collectability and also adjusting for any known customer payment issues with account balances in the less than day past due aging buckets 
account balances are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined to be uncollectable 
any recoveries of account balances previously considered in the allowance for doubtful accounts reduce future additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined principally by using the last in  first out lifo method and market defined as replacement cost for raw materials and net realizable value for work in process and finished goods see note 
appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence  excessive levels  deterioration  possible alternative uses and other factors in determining net realizable value 
the cost of work in process and finished goods includes materials  direct labor  variable costs and overhead 
the company evaluates the need to record inventory adjustments on all inventories  including raw material  work in process  finished goods  spare parts and used equipment 
used equipment acquired by the company on trade in from customers is carried at estimated net realizable value 
unless specific circumstances warrant different treatment regarding inventory obsolescence  the cost basis of inventories three to four years old are reduced by  while the cost basis of inventories four to five years old are reduced by  and the cost basis of inventories greater than five years old are reduced to zero 
inventory is typically reviewed for obsolescence on an annual basis computed as of september th  the company s fiscal year end 
if significant known changes in trends  technology or other specific circumstances that warrant consideration occur during the year  then the impact on obsolescence is considered at that time 
investments marketable debt and equity securities are categorized as trading securities and are thus marked to market and stated at fair value 
fair value is determined using the quoted closing or latest bid prices for level investments and market standard valuation methodologies for level investments 
realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined by specific identification and are recognized as incurred in the consolidated statements of operations 
net unrealized gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period and represent the change in the fair value of investment holdings during the period 
long lived asset impairment property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess over its fair value of the asset s carrying value 
fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis
