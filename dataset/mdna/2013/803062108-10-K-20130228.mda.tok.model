non gaap financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls  we discuss two key measures that are not calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the first non gaap measure is operating income  as reported on our consolidated statements of operations  excluding certain expenses and benefits  which we refer to as non gaap income from operations 
the second measure calculates non gaap income from operations as a percentage of reported services revenues  which we refer to as non gaap operating margin 
management believes that these non gaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business 
we use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally  manage our business and evaluate our performance 
we exclude certain expenses and benefits from non gaap income from operations that we believe are not reflective of the underlying business trends and are not useful measures in determining our operational performance and overall business strategy 
because our reported non gaap financial measures are not calculated according to gaap  these measures may not necessarily be comparable to gaap or similarly described non gaap measures reported by other companies within our industry 
consequently  our non gaap financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable gaap measures  but  rather  should be considered together with our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with gaap and included in part ii
