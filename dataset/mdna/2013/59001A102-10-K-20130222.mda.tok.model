item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook industry conditions during  the overall housing market results indicate the industry is stabilizing  largely driven by continued excellent housing affordability based on historical metrics  decreasing inventory home levels in many markets  and increasing consumer confidence levels related to the homebuilding industry and the overall economy 
increased interest and traffic in our communities have resulted in positive order trends in all of our active divisions 
while individual markets continue to experience varying results as local economic and employment situations strongly influence demand  most of our markets are benefiting from the homebuilding recovery  particularly those markets most affected by the downturn  including california  arizona and florida 
we continue to focus on successfully differentiating ourselves from our competition by offering exciting and desirable new plans that successfully demonstrate the benefits of our industry leading energy efficient homes situated in well located communities 
we also offer our buyers the ability to personalize their homes and provide a home warranty  successfully setting us apart from the competition we face with resale homes 
overall  our positive results throughout have strengthened our financial position  with solid improvements in all of our key operating metrics  including increases in orders per community  closings  averages sales prices  orders  backlog  gross margin and net earnings 
summary company results total home closing revenue was billion for the year ended december   increasing from million for and from million in we earned net income of million compared to a net loss of million in and income of million in our results include only million of real estate related impairments  a million of loss from early extinguishment of debt  million charge for litigation accruals related to a joint venture  and reflect a million benefit from income taxes due to the reversal of most of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
in  results included million of real estate related impairments  million of which is related to our las vegas operations 
as we have previously discussed  we are in the process of winding down our nevada operations 
we believe the nevada impairments are indicative of that market only and not our overall operations 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our remaining nevada assets 
in  we incurred million of real estate related impairments  million loss from early extinguishment of debt  and had a million tax benefit 
at december   our backlog of million was up from million at december  our december  backlog was million 
increased home orders per community in are largely responsible for the increase in ending backlog over our average sales price for homes in backlog increased to  up from  at december   and up from  at december  primarily due to mix of homes shifting to higher priced markets and states  more sought after closer in locations  and our pricing power in many communities 
our cancellation rate on sales orders as a percentage of gross sales decreased in to down from and  respectively  for the years ended december  and  reflecting a high quality backlog and greater confidence among buyers  supported by increasing prices and expectations of further home value appreciation 
we believe these positive trends will result in improved operating results in company actions and positioning as the homebuilding market stabilizes and recovers  we remain focused on our main goals of growing our orders and revenue  generating profit and maintaining a strong balance sheet 
to help meet these goals we continued to execute on the following initiatives in strengthening our balance sheet completed a new senior note issuance and debt tender  extending our earliest debt maturities until and completed a convertible debt transaction at an attractive interest rate  generating additional working capital and improving liquidity completed an equity offering and established a revolving credit facility  continue to actively acquire and develop lots in markets we deem key to our success in order to maintain and grow our lot supply and active community count  grew controlled lots by  utilizing our enhanced market research to capitalize on the knowledge of our buyers demands in each community  tailoring our pricing  product and amenities offered  continuing to innovate and promote the meritage green energy efficiency program  where every new home we construct  at a minimum  meets energy star standards  including the recent construction of the only triple certified homes in the country  certified by the us environmental protection agency  for indoor air quality  water conservation and overall energy efficiency  adapting sales and marketing efforts to generate additional traffic and compete with resale homes  focusing our purchasing efforts to manage cost increases as homebuilding recovers and demand rises  growing our inventory balance while ensuring sufficient liquidity through exercising tight control over cash flows  striving for excellence in construction  and monitoring our customers satisfaction as measured by survey scores and working toward improving them based on the results of the surveys 
we previously consolidated overhead functions in all of our divisions and at our corporate offices to hold down general and administrative cost burden and we continue to carefully manage such expenditures 
additionally  we are continually evaluating opportunities for expansion into new markets that indicate positive long term growth trends 
we are looking to redeploy our capital into projects both within our geographic footprint and through entry into new markets 
in connection with these efforts  in we announced our entry into the raleigh durham  north carolina and tampa  florida markets and our intention to wind down operations in the hard hit las vegas  nevada market 
we also announced in our entry into the charlotte  north carolina market where operations commenced in the last quarter of the year 
we believe that the investments in our new communities  markets and product offerings create a differentiated strategy that has lessened the impact of the economic conditions over the past several years and has improved our operating leverage 
throughout  we opened new communities while closing out communities  ending the year with active communities 
the relatively flat actively selling community count is to a large extent the result of our improved sales pace in  which has resulted in closing out communities at a faster pace than we anticipated 
in addition  we are acquiring more undeveloped land that has a longer lead time for development activities before new communities are able to open for sales 
in the second and third quarters of  we also took steps to strengthen our balance sheet and extend debt maturities through three capital transactions 
in april  we concurrently issued million of senior notes due and redeemed all of our million senior notes due and approximately million of our million of senior subordinated notes due  extending our earliest debt maturities to during the third quarter of  we completed an equity offering of  shares  generating approximately million in net proceeds 
we also issued million in convertible senior notes due in the third quarter  generating approximately million of net proceeds 
in addition  we established an unsecured revolving credit facility with a capacity of million during the third quarter to provide additional liquidity 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our debt transactions 
we believe such initiatives help support our goals and  coupled with the improving economy and homebuilding market  allow us to be well positioned to take advantage of a full recovery as it occurs 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are revised when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts  industry practices  and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates and could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from a home sale when title passes to the homeowner  the homeowner s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home  the receivable  if any  from the homeowner is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold home 
these conditions are typically achieved when a home closes 
revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is relatively complete  title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
although there is limited subjectivity in this accounting policy  we have designated revenue recognition as a critical accounting policy due to the significance of this balance in our statements of operations 
real estate real estate is stated at cost unless the community or land is determined to be impaired  at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  property  plant and equipment 
inventory includes the costs of land acquisition  land development and home construction  capitalized interest  real estate taxes  direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction that benefit the entire community  less impairments  if any 
land and development costs are typically allocated and transferred to homes under construction when home construction begins 
home construction costs are accumulated on a per home basis 
cost of home closings includes the specific construction costs of the home and all related allocated land acquisition  land development and other common costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community or phase 
any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community or phase are allocated to the remaining homes in the community or phase 
when a home closes  we may have incurred costs for goods and services that have not yet been paid 
therefore  an accrual to capture such obligations is recorded in connection with the home closing and charged directly to cost of sales 
typically  an entitled community s life cycle ranges from three to five years  commencing with the acquisition of the land  continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale  construction and closing of the homes 
actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community  the absorption rates and whether the land purchased was raw land or finished lots 
master planned communities encompassing several phases and super block land parcels may have significantly longer lives and projects involving smaller finished lot purchases may be significantly shorter 
additionally  the recent slow down in the housing market negatively impacted our sales pace  which extended the lives of certain of our communities 
all of our land inventory and related real estate assets are reviewed for recoverability at least quarterly  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present  as our inventory is considered long lived in accordance with gaap 
if an asset is deemed not recoverable  we record an impairment charge to the extent the fair value of such asset is less than its carrying amount 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis and actual results may also differ from our assumptions 
our analysis is completed at a community level with each community or land parcel evaluated individually 
we pay particular attention to communities experiencing a larger than anticipated reduction in their absorption rates or averages sales prices or where gross margins are trending lower than anticipated 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the assets carrying balance exceeds their fair value 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a straight line basis 
existing and continuing communities 
when projections for the remaining income expected to be earned from an existing community are no longer positive  the underlying real estate assets are not deemed fully recoverable  and further analysis is performed to determine the required impairment 
the fair value of the community s assets is determined using either a discounted cash flow model for projects we intend to build out or a market based approach for projects to be sold and the impairments are charged to cost of home closings in the period during which it is determined that the fair value is less than the assets carrying amount 
if a market based approach is used  we determine fair value based on recent comparable purchase and sale activity in the local market  adjusted for known variances as determined by our knowledge of the region and general real estate expertise 
if a discounted cash flow approach is used  we compute fair value based on a proprietary model 
our key estimates in deriving fair value under our cash flow model are i home selling prices in the community adjusted for current and expected sales discounts and incentives  ii costs related to the community both land development and home construction including costs spent to date and budgeted remaining costs to spend  iii projected sales absorption rates  reflecting any product mix change strategies implemented to stimulate the sales pace and expected cancellation rates  iv alternative land uses including disposition of all or a portion of the land owned and v our discount rate  which is currently and varies based on our perceived risk inherent in the community s other cash flow assumptions 
these assumptions vary widely across different communities and geographies and are largely dependent on local market conditions 
community level factors that may impact our key estimates include the presence and significance of local competitors  including their offered product type and competitive actions  economic and related demographic conditions for the population of the surrounding community  desirability of the particular community  including unique amenities or other favorable or unfavorable attributes  and existing home inventory supplies  including foreclosures and short sales 
these local circumstances may significantly impact our assumptions and the resulting computation of fair value  and are  therefore  closely evaluated by our division personnel in their creation of the discounted cash flow models 
the models are also evaluated by regional and corporate personnel for consistency and integration  as decisions that affect pricing or absorption at one community may have resulting consequences for neighboring communities 
we typically do not project market improvements in our discounted cash flow models  but may do so in limited circumstances in the latter years of a long lived community 
mothball communities 
in certain cases  we may elect to stop development mothball of an existing community if we believe the economic performance of the community would be maximized by deferring development for a period of time to allow market conditions to improve 
when a community is initially placed into mothball status  it is management belief that the community is affected by local market conditions that are expected to improve within the next years 
therefore  a temporary postponement of construction and development work is expected to yield better overall future returns 
the decision may be based on financial and or operational metrics 
if we decide to mothball a community  we will impair it to its fair value as discussed above and then cease future development activity until such a time when management believes that market conditions have improved and economic performance will be maximized 
no costs are capitalized to communities that are designated as mothballed 
in addition to our quarterly impairment analysis  which is conducted to determine if any current impairments exist  we also conduct a thorough quarterly review of our underperforming and mothballed communities to determine if they are at risk of future impairment 
the financial and operational status and expectations of these communities are analyzed as well as any unique attributes that could be viewed as indicators for future impairments 
adjustments are made accordingly and incremental impairments  if any  are recorded at each re evaluation 
based on the facts and circumstances available as of december   we do not believe that any of our underperforming or mothballed communities will incur material impairments in the future 
changes in market and or economic conditions could materially impact the conclusions of this analysis  and there can be no assurances that future impairments will not occur 
inventory assessments on inactive assets 
for our mothballed communities as well as our land held for future development  our inventory assessments typically include highly subjective estimates for future performance  including the timing of development  the product to be offered  sales rates and selling prices of the product when the community is anticipated to open for sales  and the projected costs to develop and construct the community 
we evaluate various factors to develop our forecasts  including the availability of and demand for homes and finished lots within the marketplace  historical  current and future sales trends  and third party data  if available 
based on these factors  we reach conclusions for future performance based on our judgment 
option deposits and pre acquisition costs we also evaluate assets associated with future communities for impairments on a quarterly basis 
using similar techniques described in the existing and continuing communities section above  we determine if the income to be generated by our future communities is acceptable to us 
if the projections indicate that a community is still meeting our internal investment guidelines and is generating a profit  those assets are determined to be fully recoverable and no impairments are required 
in cases where we decide to abandon the project  we will fully impair all assets related to such project and will expense and accrue any additional costs that we are contractually obligated to incur 
in certain circumstances  we may also elect to continue with a project because it is expected to generate positive future cash flows  even though it may not be generating an accounting profit  or because of other strategic factors 
in such cases  we will impair our pre acquisition costs and deposits  as necessary  to record an impairment to bring the book value to fair value 
due to the complexity and subjectivity of these fair value computations  as well as the significance of associated impairments to our financial statements in recent years  we have concluded that the valuation of our real estate and associated assets is a critical accounting policy 
during  we recorded million of such impairment charges related to our home and land inventories 
additionally  we wrote off approximately million of deposits and pre acquisition costs relating to projects that were no longer economically feasible 
refer to note of these consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion regarding these impairments and the associated remaining fair values of impaired communities 
the impairment charges were based on our fair value calculations  which are affected by current market conditions  assumptions and expectations  all of which are highly subjective and may differ significantly from actual results if market conditions change 
due to the volume of possible outcomes that can be generated from changes in the various model inputs for each community  we do not believe it is possible to create a sensitivity analysis that can provide meaningful information for the users of our financial statements 
warranty reserves we use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction 
although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects  we are  during applicable warranty periods  ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs 
as such  warranty reserves are recorded to cover our exposure to absorb the costs for materials and labor not expected to be covered by our subcontractors to the extent they relate to warranty type claims subsequent to the delivery of a home to the homeowner 
reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and  with the assistance of an actuary for the structural warranty  we determine their sufficiency based on our and industry wide historical data and trends 
these reserves are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding structural defect claims for the products we build  the markets in which we build  claim settlement history  insurance and legal interpretations and expected recoveries  among other factors 
at december   our warranty reserve was million  reflecting an accrual of to of a home s sale price depending on our loss history in the geographic area in which the home was built 
a increase in our warranty reserve rate would have increased our accrual and corresponding cost of sales by approximately million in we recorded a million favorable adjustment to our reserve in based on historical trends of actual claims paid and our success in recovery of expended amounts 
we recorded no such adjustments in while we believe that the warranty reserve is sufficient to cover our projected costs  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
off balance sheet arrangements historically  we have invested in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unaffiliated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
we currently are a member of only two such active land joint ventures 
all joint venture entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by either the cost or the equity method of accounting where the criteria for consolidation have not been met as set forth in asc  consolidation asc 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as earnings from unconsolidated entities  net 
in order to determine if we should consolidate equity basis joint ventures  we determine if the ventures are variable interest entities vies and if we are the primary beneficiary of the unconsolidated entity 
factors considered in our determination include our ability to control the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance  and in cases where we do control such activities  if we also are expected to absorb the majority of the expected losses or expected gains of the entity 
for those entities where we are deemed the primary beneficiary  we would be required to consolidate the investment in our financial statements in accordance with asc we enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we also analyze these agreements under asc to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie  if applicable  using a similar analysis  as noted above 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements 
in cases where we are the primary beneficiary  even though we do not have title to such land  we would be required to consolidate these purchase option agreements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned in our consolidated balance sheets 
the liabilities related to consolidated vies are excluded from our debt covenant calculations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we evaluate our deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction  including the benefit from nols by tax jurisdiction  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
companies must assess  using significant judgments  whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the length of statutory carryforward periods  experience with operating losses and experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives 
based upon a review of all available evidence  we recorded a full non cash valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during due to economic conditions and the weight of negative evidence at the time 
we no longer maintain a full non cash valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in most jurisdictions at december  as we have determined that the weight of the positive evidence exceeds that of the negative evidence and it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets and nol carryovers in most of our tax jurisdictions  including federal  florida  and most other states 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million all state related and million million federal and million state  respectively  against deferred tax assets which include the tax benefit from nol carryovers 
our future deferred tax asset realization depends on sufficient taxable income in the carryforward periods under existing tax laws 
federal net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income for years and expire in state net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income for a period of time ranging from to years  depending on the state  and begin to expire in on an ongoing basis  we will continue to review all available evidence to determine if and when we expect to realize our state nol carryovers that are subject to the remaining valuation allowance 
share based payments we have stock options and restricted common stock units nonvested shares outstanding under our stock compensation plan 
per the terms of the plan  the exercise price of our stock options may not be less than the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant  nor may options granted under the plans be exercised within one year from the date of the grant 
after one year  exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed seven years from the date of the grant 
our last stock option grant was in our restricted stock generally vests on a pro rata basis over either three or five years 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is determined at the time of grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on a composite of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility from our traded options 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding 
a decrease in our forfeiture rate would have increased our stock compensation by approximately million in the composition of our closings  home orders and backlog is constantly changing and is based on a dissimilar mix of communities between periods as new projects open and existing projects wind down 
further  individual homes within a community can range significantly in price due to differing square footage  option selections  lot sizes and quality of lots eg cul de sac  view lots  greenbelt lots 
these variations result in a lack of meaningful comparability between our home orders  closings and backlog due to the changing mix between periods

home closings revenue for the year ended december  increased to billion when compared to the prior year  due to a unit increase in units closed and a  increase in average closing price 
home orders also increased significantly to billion on  units in as compared to million on  units in  reflecting increased average sales prices of  or  and our lower cancellation rate of as compared to in this improved demand resulted in a unit  or  increase in our year end backlog  ending with  homes as compared to homes in additionally  the increase in the value of orders in backlog increased due to a  or increase in average sales price for the year ended december  versus the same period a year ago 
our improved closings revenues and orders results reflect our ability to capitalize on the homebuilding recovery currently underway  while benefiting from our successful land positions  desirable home designs and industry leading energy efficiency innovations 
our average price increase in was a result of a shift in our mix to higher priced markets and states and attractive closer in locations  as well as our overall ability to implement sales price increases in many communities 
our active community count was flat at communities at the end of as compared to in west 
in  home closings spiked to  units with a value of million  an increase of million or  attributable to additional units closed  up from average orders per community increased from in to in  which led to a unit or million increase in orders as compared to  resulting in an ending backlog in the region of additional units  a increase 
these results  coupled with the  increase in average sales price  led to ending backlog in the region valued at million on units 
we believe the desirability and affordability of our community locations and the meritage green product offering helped drive up demand  which positively impacted the overall performance of this region  and california in particular 
improvements in the california markets were the major drivers for the performance in this region  although each of our markets experienced significant growth compared to the prior year 
we believe that the demand and consumer confidence recoveries in california and arizona are at least partially the result of significantly improved affordability created by the decline in home prices and pent up demand from recession related home price decreases in these states 
average orders per active community in california for increased over the prior year  a strong indicator that this market is experiencing a recovery that is translating to some of our most impressive comparative trends 
the increases in orders per community led to faster sell out of  and a drop in  the number of actively selling communities in california  from in to in  which we are actively working to replenish 
we believe the successes in california  arizona and colorado are a testament to our strategy that emphasizes well located lot and land positions  innovative product design and our energy efficient features 
arizona volumes increased in both closings and orders by and  respectively over the same period a year ago  with recent significant pricing power as consumer confidence increased 
arizona has benefited from the shift to newer communities in highly desirable locations offering energy efficient green features in larger square footage homes  contributing to a  or  increase in average sales price per home on orders  which aided the overall increase in order dollars and backlog to million and million  respectively 
colorado contributed closings and million of associated revenue  a increase in revenue over the same period a year ago 
colorado also experienced an increase in orders during  rising to million on units  a and respective increase over with the average sales price increasing  on orders 
this directly contributed to the increase in backlog order value in colorado of versus  ending the year with homes valued at million 
the bolstered orders and backlog in colorado year over year are due both to an increase in the number of actively selling communities of at december  versus at year end and also to a increase in orders pace 
nevada was relatively flat in closings  while experiencing increases in orders and backlog units in of and  respectively  as compared to as previously discussed  we are winding down operations in nevada and have only one actively selling community remaining there 
we expect to complete all construction activity in nevada in central 
the central region  made up of our texas markets  closed  units totaling million in revenues  flat with those reported in  reflecting a slower sales pace in the first half of texas remained our largest volume market in the country during  experiencing an increase in orders to  units as compared to  units for the same period a year ago as sales paces picked up in latter the orders increases were achieved despite a slight decrease in active communities in texas  which was a result of a faster sell out of communities as indicated by our increase in average orders per community 
over the last two years  we initiated a strategic redeployment of capital to other markets that presented opportunities to generate higher average sales prices and margins 
this strategy has resulted in the rebalancing of assets from texas into other markets  primarily california  arizona  colorado and florida  although texas continues to be an important contributor to our financial results  and we contracted for additional communities there in the central region s increase in orders of units occurred later in and translated to a unit increase in ending backlog of versus units at december  and  respectively  aided by a  average sales price increase on orders  which contributed to a higher ending backlog value of million  an increase of million 
as the decline in the homebuilding market in texas was not as extreme as in other locations  we expect the improvements here to be more tempered than those we are experiencing in the markets that were hardest hit in the downturn 
east 
our east region generated closings with million of home revenue in  a and increase  respectively  from the same period in the region also experienced impressive results in orders generating million of additional order dollars  due to both a increase in units as well as an  increase in average sales price in versus this is mainly attributable to our increase in the number of average actively selling communities with the addition of our new markets in raleigh  charlotte and tampa 
we believe our relatively flat average orders per community of over in prior year signals the stability of this market  yet it is still one of the highest in the company 
the florida market was the largest contributor to the region s results  although operations in the carolinas contributed units  or million in closings and units  or million  in order volume from seven actively selling communities at year end 
our carolinas operations currently build homes with some of our highest sales prices contributing to an average sales price on orders during of  operations in our recently opened tampa division also provided its first two closings in the fourth quarter of  and ended the year with orders and homes in backlog valued at million 
the performance in this region is a testament to our commitment of focusing our efforts to enter highly sought after markets with strong buyer demand 
we ended with units in backlog in the region valued at million  and increases over  respectively 
we believe that our offering of primarily larger product with meritage green features that appeal to our buyers and the superior location of our communities have helped the overall performance of this region 
land closing revenue and gross profit from time to time  we may sell certain land parcels to other homebuilders  developers or investors if we feel the sale will provide a greater economic benefit to us than continuing home construction or where we are looking to diversify our land positions in the specific geography 
as a result of such sales  we recognized land closing revenue of million  and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
we also recognized impairments related to land sales and on parcels marketed for future sale in the amount of million  and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
all of our impairments and million of our impairments related to parcels we sold or intend to sell in connection with our wind down of our las vegas operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closings revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million  an decrease when compared to the prior year  due to a unit reduction in units closed that was partially offset by a  increase in average closing price 
the decrease in closing units was mainly attributable to the higher closing volumes that the federal homebuyer tax credit program generated in the first half of our results  with no such benefit in home orders increased to million on  units in as compared to million on  units in  reflecting increased average sales prices of  or  and a lower cancellation rate of as compared to in improved demand in the latter part of resulted in a unit increase in our year end backlog  ending with homes as compared to homes in additionally  the value of orders in backlog increased due to a  or increase in average sales price for the year ended december  versus the same period a year ago 
our average price increase in was a result of a shift in our mix to higher priced markets and desirable closer in locations 
our active community count increased to communities at the end of as compared to in  also assisting our sales orders comparisons 
west 
in  home closings dropped by units or but were partially offset by an increase in average sales prices of  per unit providing million in revenue on  units  as compared to million and  units in the decrease in closing units and revenue was mainly attributable to a slower orders pace in the first half of  translating into fewer deliveries in in addition to the federal tax credit  california also offered a state homebuyer tax credit during  which positively impacted comparative sales volumes in increases in orders as the year progressed led to a unit or million increase in orders for as compared to  resulting in an increase in ending backlog in the region of million on units  a and increase  respectively 
these increases  coupled with the  increase in average sales price  led to ending backlog in the region valued at million on units 
well positioned communities in desirable submarkets  primarily in california and arizona  were largely to credit for the higher average sales prices that benefited this region in the california improvements were aided by a increase in our average active community count in  up to as of year end 
arizona had a year over year decrease in orders of units  but a million increase in total orders value 
the unit decrease reflected slower results in the first half of compared to the first half of reflecting the tax credits available in  as discussed previously 
however  the value gains were due to the higher average sales prices from a shift to larger square footage homes 
arizona ended with more units in backlog  valued at million  a increase over the same period a year ago due to increasing orders volumes in the latter half of colorado contributed a increase in orders to for the year ended december   coupled with a  or increase in average sales price 
this momentum led colorado to end with units in backlog valued at million  a increase over the nevada market saw declines in closings  orders and backlog associated with the wind down of its operations 
central 
the central region closed  units in totaling million in revenues  and  respectively  lower than those reported in the unit or decrease in home closings in the region from the same period a year ago was due primarily to a decrease in average active communities 
the decrease in active communities was a result of closing out of lower performing subdivisions in less desirable submarkets in texas and the strategic redeployment of capital to other markets in that presented opportunities to generate higher average sales prices and margins 
the central region s orders decline of units resulted in a unit drop in ending backlog to at december  versus units at december  east 
our east region generated closings with million of home revenue in  a and increase  respectively from the same period in and was the only region without lower year over year closing comparisons in the region also experienced significant improvements in orders generating million of additional orders  due to both a increase in units as well as a  increase in average sales price in versus the florida market was the largest contributor to the region s results  although sales operations in the carolinas market commenced in the fourth quarter  contributing units  or million  in order volume and backlog from three actively selling communities 
we ended with units in backlog with a value of million  and increases from  respectively 
land closing revenue and gross profit as a result of land sales  we recognized land closing revenue of million  and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
we also recognized impairments related to land sales and on parcels marketed for future sale in the amount of million  and  for the years ending december   and  respectively

we provide gross margins excluding impairments a non gaap term as we use it to evaluate our performance and believe it is a widely accepted financial measure by users of our financial statements in analyzing our operating results and provides comparability to similar calculations by our peers in the homebuilding industry 
however  gross margins excluding impairments as presented may not be fully comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies because not all companies calculate this metric in an identical manner 
this measure is not intended to represent gaap gross margins and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing gross margin increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  gross margins excluding impairments were and for and  respectively 
our margin increases are mainly due to the price increases we have been able to initiate in many of our markets  somewhat offset by increases in various cost components and the shift to more desirable locations and larger product offerings  which typically generate higher profitability 
our impairment charges reflect the write down to fair value of certain real estate and related assets of million in and million in our impairments in largely reflect the wind down of operations in our nevada market 
west 
our west region experienced a significant increase in home closing gross margin to for from in these margins included impairments of million in versus million in the prior year 
the impairments in were primarily related to our las vegas assets as previously discussed 
excluding these impairments  the gross margins for and were and  respectively 
the region gross margins benefited from the impact of better leverage of construction overhead costs due to a greater number of home closings from the same period a year ago and price increases  partially offset by higher construction costs 
central 
the central region saw an increase in home closing gross margin of in as compared to in the central region s home closing gross margins include million of real estate related impairments for compared to million for excluding these impairments  the gross margin in this region was in  compared to in this slight improvement is mostly due to our shift in product offering in new and desirable locations that are generating higher profitability as previously discussed 
east 
while the east region continues to generate the highest gross margins for us  we saw a decrease in to versus in and in versus in  excluding impairments 
the year over year decrease is mainly due to the closeout of communities that were acquired during the early stages of the downturn  which provided higher comparative gross margins due to their particularly low land basis based on when they were acquired 
these communities make up a smaller portion of our actively selling communities in as compared to fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing gross margin decreased slightly to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  gross margins excluding impairments were and for and  respectively 
our margin decreases in as compared to were representative of the impact of reduced leverage of construction overhead costs due to a lesser number of closings from impairment charges reflect the write down to fair value of certain real estate and related assets of million in and million in west 
our west region experienced a decrease in home closing gross margin to for from in these margins included impairments of million in versus million in the prior year 
excluding these impairments  the gross margins for and were and  respectively 
the impairments were primarily related to our las vegas assets 
gross margins excluding impairments dipped in  mostly due to additional price concessions in california  particularly in the first part of central 
the central region s home closing gross margin in was up compared to in excluding these impairments  the gross margin in this region was in and in the central region s home closing gross margins include million of real estate related impairments for compared to million for east 
while the east region continued to generate the highest gross margins in the country  we saw a decrease in to versus in and in versus in  excluding impairments 
the decrease was mainly due to the close out of certain highly profitable communities in late and our entry into certain highly desirable and high volume communities that had additional building and design requirements that resulted in some cost increases as previously discussed

commissions and other sales costs are comprised of internal and external commissions and related sales and marketing expenses such as advertising and sales office costs 
these costs increased by million for versus this primarily relates to increased commission expense attributable to higher closing units and revenue dollars 
the decrease year over year as a percentage of revenue is primarily the result of leverage from higher revenue on the fixed component of selling costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for versus million in  or and of total revenue  respectively 
the increased expenses are mostly due to higher stock based compensation expense and performance based compensation related to the attainment of multiple metrics on which divisional management compensation is partially based 
the significant decrease as a percentage of revenue is due to the higher revenue earned in as compared to earnings from unconsolidated entities  net 
earnings from unconsolidated entities  net represents our portion of pre tax earnings from joint ventures 
included in this amount is both the pass through of earnings from the joint venture most recently available financial statements as well as any accrued expected earnings losses for the periods presented that might not have been reflected in the joint venture financial statements provided to us 
the increase in as compared to is primarily attributable to the increased closings volume as most of our joint venture activity is from mortgage and title operations 
interest expense 
interest expense is comprised of interest incurred  but not capitalized  on our senior  senior subordinated and convertible notes  and other borrowings 
during and  our non capitalizable interest expense was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in expense year over year is a result of a higher amount of active assets under development that qualify for interest capitalization 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net primarily consists of i interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  investments and marketable securities  ii sub lease income  iii forfeited deposits from potential homebuyers who canceled their purchase contract with us  and iv payments and awards related to legal settlements 
we reported net other expense in as compared to net other income in primarily due to the million increased litigation reserve amount recorded in the third quarter of see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
loss on extinguishment of debt is attributable to the charges associated with the tender of our million notes and million of our notes 
the charges represent both the loss on the extinguishment as well as the write off of remaining unamortized capitalized costs related to the tendered notes 
there were no such debt extinguishment charges in income taxes 
our overall effective tax rates were a benefit of for  compared to a provision of for the change in our tax rate is primarily attributable to reversal of most of our deferred tax valuation allowance in fiscal compared to fiscal commissions and other sales costs 
these costs decreased by million for versus the decrease primarily relates to reduced commission expense attributable to lower closing units and revenue dollars 
the increase year over year as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of lower revenue coupled with the introduction of strategically targeted marketing campaigns  including increased investments in alternative marketing channels  such as the internet and social media outlets 
in addition  we established a marketing call center in  which provides centralized sales and marketing information to our homebuyers nation wide seven days a week 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for versus million in  or and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase is mostly due to higher stock based compensation expense  the divisional overhead costs to start up a new division in north carolina  upgrades to our market research and technology tools and increased legal fees 
earnings from unconsolidated entities  net 
the increase in as compared to is primarily attributable to the joint venture impairment charges incurred in see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more detail 
interest expense 
during and  our non capitalizable interest expense was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in expense year over year is a result of a higher amount of active assets under development that qualify for interest capitalization 
other expenses income  net 
the decrease is primarily attributed to the recognition of cash and certain assets awarded to us in in connection with a legal settlement 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
loss on extinguishment of debt in is attributable to the charges associated with the tender of our senior notes due and partial tender of our senior notes due the charges represent both the loss on the extinguishment as well as the write off of remaining unamortized capitalized costs related to the notes 
there were no such debt extinguishment charges in income taxes 
our overall effective tax rates were a provision of for  compared to a benefit of for the change in our tax rate was primarily attributable to franchise taxes which were not based on pre tax net income 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal uses of capital for were operating expenses  home construction  the payment of routine liabilities  and the acquisition and development of new and strategic lot positions 
we used funds generated by operations and our cash reserves which we bolstered in by our refinancing transactions to meet our short term working capital requirements 
we remain focused on acquiring desirable land positions  generating positive margins in our homebuilding operations and maintaining a strong balance sheet to support us for future growth 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on their stage of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are a component of our inventory and not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes  we incur significant cash outlays prior to recognition of earnings 
in the later stages of a community  cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred 
from a liquidity standpoint  we are currently actively acquiring and developing lots in our markets to maintain and grow our lot supply and active community count 
we are also using our cash on hand to fund operations in several of our new markets 
as demand for new homes improves and we continue to expand our business  we expect cash outlays for land purchases  land development and home construction will continue to exceed our cash generated by operations in the near term 
during  we closed  homes  purchased about  lots for million  spent million on land development  and started about  homes 
the opportunity to purchase substantially finished lots in desired locations is becoming increasingly more limited and competitive 
as a result  we are spending more dollars on land development as we are purchasing more undeveloped land and partially finished lots than in recent years 
we exercise strict controls and believe we have a prudent strategy for company wide cash management  including those related to cash outlays for land and inventory acquisition and development 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  investments and securities  and restricted cash  a million decrease from december   primarily a result of land acquisitions and land development dollars spent and increases in our home inventory under construction  partially offset by cash generated from home closings and the net effect of our various capital transactions 
as we have no debt maturities until  we will generate cash from the sale of our inventory  but we intend to redeploy that cash to acquire and develop strategic and well positioned lots to grow our business 
in addition to expanding our business in existing markets  we continue to look into opportunities to expand outside of our existing markets 
accordingly  over the last two years we announced our entry into the raleigh durham  north carolina and tampa  florida markets  and our most recent new entry market was in charlotte  nc  which commenced sales operations in the fourth quarter of charlotte is the largest metropolitan area in north carolina and the second largest banking center in the us behind new york city  with a diversified industrial structure  low cost of business and a well educated population base 
it is positioned for long term growth and expected to outpace the national average through we have purchased lots in four communities and have also secured three additional properties through purchase contracts  located in some of the most attractive submarkets in this area 
these opportunities expand our footprint into new markets with positive growth potential and the ability to leverage our existing east region resources 
additionally  we continue to evaluate our capital needs in light of the improving homebuilding markets and our existing capital structure 
in the third quarter of  we completed an equity offering of  shares and established an unsecured revolving credit facility with a capacity of million  and we also issued million in convertible senior notes 
considering the impact of our financing and capital transactions previously discussed  we believe that we currently have strong liquidity 
nevertheless  we may seek additional capital to strengthen our liquidity position  enable us to opportunistically acquire additional land inventory in anticipation of improving market conditions  and or strengthen our long term capital structure 
such additional capital may be in the form of equity or debt financing and may be from a variety of sources 
there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and such additional equity or debt financing could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders or increase our interest costs 
reference is made to note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we believe that our leverage ratios provide useful information to the users of our financial statements regarding our financial position and cash and debt management 
debt to capital and net debt to capital are calculated as follows dollars in thousands at december  at december  notes payable and other borrowings stockholders equity total capital debt to capital notes payable and other borrowings less cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments and securities net debt stockholders equity total net capital net debt to capital debt to capital is computed as senior  senior subordinated and convertible notes divided by the aggregate of total senior  senior subordinated and convertible notes and stockholders equity 
net debt to capital is computed as net debt divided by the aggregate of net debt and stockholders equity 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is the ratio of debt to total capital 
we believe the ratio of net debt to capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing 
senior  senior subordinated and convertible notes senior notes in march  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in april  we repurchased approximately million of our senior notes and purchased the remaining million in april senior subordinated notes in february  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due in april  we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of approximately million  resulting in million in aggregate principal remaining on the notes 
the indenture that governs the senior subordinated notes requires us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of unconsolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to together  the ratio requirement  provided  however  this limitation does not generally apply to most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness  other indebtedness up to million and non recourse indebtedness  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates  and limiting the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the indenture 
senior notes during the second quarter of  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were issued at of par value to yield 
senior notes in april  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were issued at par and their associated proceeds were primarily used to pay down the remaining balance of million of the notes 
convertible senior notes in september  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes will initially be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes 
this corresponds to an initial conversion price of per share and represents a conversion premium based on the closing price of our common stock on september  the conversion rate is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of specific events 
the notes may be redeemed by the note holders on the fifth  tenth and fifteenth anniversary dates of the notes 
we may call the notes at any time after the fifth anniversary  and before the notes mature on september  the indentures for our and senior notes contain covenants including  among others  limitations on the amount of secured debt we may incur  and limitations on sale and leaseback transactions of non model home assets and mergers 
the covenants contained in the and senior notes are generally no more restrictive  and in many cases less restrictive  than the covenants contained in the indenture for the senior subordinated notes 
our convertible senior notes do not have any financial covenants 
million unsecured revolving credit facility in july  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility  of which million will be available for letters of credit 
the credit facility matures in july borrowings under the credit facility are unsecured but availability is subject to  among other things  a borrowing base 
the credit facility also contains certain financial covenants  including a a minimum tangible net worth requirement of million which amount is subject to increase over time based on subsequent earnings and proceeds from equity offerings  and b a maximum leverage covenant that prohibits the leverage ratio as defined therein from exceeding 
in addition  we are required to maintain either i an interest coverage ratio ebitda to interest expense  as defined therein of at least to increasing to to on january  and thereafter or ii liquidity as defined therein of an amount not less than our consolidated interest incurred during the trailing months 
no amounts were drawn under the credit facility during indenture covenant compliance we were in compliance with all senior and senior subordinated note financial covenants as of december  in order to be out of compliance with the ratio requirement  we would need to fail both the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios  not just one ratio independently 
a failure to meet both the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio is not a default but rather results in a prohibition subject to exceptions from incurring additional indebtedness only 
our actual fixed charge and leverage ratio as of december  are reflected in the table below financial covenant covenant requirement actual in millions fixed charge coverage leverage ratio credit facility covenants we were in compliance with all credit facility covenants as of december  our actual financial covenant calculations as of december  are reflected in the table below financial covenant dollars in thousands covenant requirement actual minimum tangible net worth leverage ratio interest coverage ratio minimum liquidity investments other than defined permitted investments we are required to meet either the interest coverage ratio or minimum liquidity  but not both 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for all further information on our senior  senior subordinated and convertible senior notes 
land under control we enter into various purchase and option contracts for land in the normal course of business 
generally  our lot options remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts  although as demand slows  in some instances starts may fall below the pre established minimum number of lot purchases 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the total number of lots under control at december  was  as compared to  at december  in and  respectively  and of our controlled lots were owned 
the increase in our land holdings from prior year was due to an intentional effort to grow our lot positions in quality submarkets during  as we entered into new land contracts for approximately  lots for million as compared to approximately  lots for million in at december   our total option and purchase contracts had purchase prices in the aggregate of approximately million  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash 
off balance sheet arrangements reference is made to notes  and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these notes discuss our off balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements  and land development joint ventures  including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items 
in addition  these notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in connection with the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations  including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated

except in limited circumstances  or upon the occurrence of specific trigger events for our convertible notes  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to repay such debt

our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs
