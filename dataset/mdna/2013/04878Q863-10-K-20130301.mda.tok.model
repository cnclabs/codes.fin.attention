power industry overview historically  the north american electricity industry was characterized by vertically integrated monopolies 
during the late s  several jurisdictions began a process of restructuring by moving 
table of contents away from vertically integrated monopolies toward more competitive market models 
rapid growth in electricity demand  environmental concerns  increasing electricity rates  technological advances and other concerns prompted government policies to encourage the supply of electricity from independent power producers 
according to the north american electric reliability council nerc long term reliability assessment  published in november  summer peak demand within the united states in the ten year period from through is projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of approximately  while winter peak demand in canada is projected to increase 
nerc reliability assessment also projects increased dependence on natural gas and renewables for electricity capacity 
the adoption of highly efficient combined cycle technology and the economic viability of shale gas have made gas fired generation the primary choice for new capacity with almost gigawatts gw  or approximately of planned generation capacity expected over the next years 
the share of capacity from renewable resources will also continue to grow 
in  renewable generation made up of all on peak capacity resources and is expected to reach almost percent in the increase of gas and renewable capacity will be offset by large scale retirements of coal fired generation plants 
nerc projects gw of fossil fired generation retirement by  with over retiring by primarily due to potential and existing federal environmental regulations and low natural gas prices 
the non utility power generation industry in the independent power generation sector  electricity is generated from a number of energy sources  including natural gas  coal  water  waste products such as biomass eg  wood  wood waste  agricultural waste  landfill gas  geothermal  solar and wind 
our power generation projects in operation are non utility electric generating facilities that operate in the north american electric power generation industry 
the electric power industry is one of the largest industries in the united states  generating retail electricity sales of approximately billion in  based on information published by the energy information administration in november a growing portion of the power produced in the united states and canada is generated by non utility generators 
according to the energy information administration  independent power producers represented approximately of total net generation in  the most recent year for which data are available 
independent power producers sell the electricity that they generate to electric utilities and other load serving entities such as municipalities and electric cooperatives by way of bilateral contracts or open power exchanges 
the electric utilities and other load serving entities  in turn  generally sell this electricity to industrial  commercial and residential customers 
competition the power generation industry is characterized by intense competition  and we compete with utilities  industrial companies and other independent power producers 
in recent years  there has been increasing competition among generators in an effort to obtain power sales agreements  and this competition has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets where supply has surpassed demand plus appropriate reserve margins 
in addition  many states and regions have aggressive demand side management programs designed to reduce current load and future local growth 
the us power industry is continuing to undergo consolidation which may provide attractive acquisition and investment opportunities  although we believe that we will continue to confront significant competition for those opportunities and  to the extent that any opportunities are identified  we may be unable to effect acquisitions or investments on attractive terms  if at all 
we compete for acquisition opportunities with numerous private equity  infrastructure and pension funds  canadian and us independent power firms  utility genco subsidiaries and other strategic and 
table of contents financial players 
our competitive advantages include our access to capital  experienced management team  diversified projects and stability of project cash flow 
industry regulation overview our facilities and operations are subject to laws and regulations that govern  among other things  transactions by and with purchasers of power  including utility companies  the development and construction of generation facilities  the ownership and operations of generation facilities  access to transmission  and the geographical location  zoning  land use and operation aspects of our facilities and properties  including environmental matters 
in the united states  the power generation and sale aspects of our projects are primarily regulated by the ferc  although most of our projects benefit from the special provisions accorded to qualifying facilities qfs or exempt wholesale generators ewgs 
in canada  electricity generation is subject primarily to provincial regulation 
our projects in british columbia are thus subject to different regulatory regimes from our projects in ontario 
regulation generating projects i united states eighteen of our power generating projects are qfs under the public utility regulatory policies act of  as amended purpa and related ferc regulations 
a qf falls into one or both of two primary classes  both of which would facilitate one of purpa goals to more efficiently use fossil fuels to generate electricity than typical utility plants 
the first class of qfs includes energy producers that generate power using renewable energy sources such as wind  solar  geothermal  hydro  biomass or waste fuels 
the second class of qfs includes cogeneration facilities  which must meet specific fossil fuel efficiency requirements by producing both electricity and steam versus electricity only 
the generating projects with qf status and which are currently party to a ppa with a utility or have been granted authority to charge market based rates are exempt from ferc rate making authority 
the ferc has granted seven of the projects the authority to charge market based rates based primarily on a finding that the projects lack market power 
the projects with qf status are also exempt from state regulation respecting the rates of electric utilities and the financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities 
however  state regulators review the prudency of utilities entering into ppas entered into by qfs and the siting of the generation facilities 
the majority of our generation is sold by qfs under ppas that required approval by state authorities 
purpa  as initially implemented by the ferc  generally required that vertically integrated electric utilities purchase power from qfs at their avoided costs 
the energy policy act of the ep act of  however  established new limits on purpa requirement that electric utilities buy electricity from qfs to certain markets that lack competitive characteristics 
the delta person and pasco projects are ewgs under the public utility holding company act of puhca 
the projects with ewg status are also exempt from state regulation respecting the rates of electric utilities  and the projects with ewg and qf status are exempt from regulations under puhca 
notwithstanding their status as qfs and ewgs  our projects remain subject to various aspects of ferc regulation  including those relating to power marketer status and to oversight of mergers  acquisitions and investments relating to utilities under the federal power act  as amended by the ep act of all of our projects are also subject to reliability standards developed and enforced by nerc 
nerc is a self regulatory non governmental organization which has statutory responsibility to 
table of contents regulate bulk power system users  generation and transmission owners and operators through the adoption and enforcement of standards for fair  ethical and efficient practices 
pursuant to its authority  nerc has issued  and the ferc has approved  a series of mandatory reliability standards 
users  owners and operators of the bulk power system can be penalized significantly for failing to comply with the ferc approved reliability standards 
we have designated our manager of operational and regulatory compliance to oversee compliance with liability standards and an outside law firm specializing in this area advises us on ferc and nerc compliance  including annual compliance training for relevant employees 
ii british columbia  canada the vast majority of british columbia power is generated or procured by bc hydro 
bc hydro is one of the largest electric utilities in canada 
bc hydro is owned by the province of british columbia and is regulated by the british columbia utilities commission the bcuc  which is governed by the utilities commission act british columbia and is responsible for the regulation of british columbia public energy utilities including publicly owned and investor owned utilities ie independent power producers 
bc hydro is generally required to acquire all new power beyond what it already generates from existing bc hydro plants from independent power producers 
all contracts for electricity supply  including those between independent power producers and bc hydro  must be filed with and approved by the bcuc as being in the public interest 
the bcuc may hold a hearing in this regard 
furthermore  the bcuc may impose conditions to be contained in agreements entered into by public utilities for electricity 
the bcuc has adopted the nerc standards as being applicable to  among others  all generators of electricity in british columbia  including independent power producers 
in addition  the bcuc has adopted a number of other standards  including the western electricity coordinating council wecc standards 
as a practical matter  wecc typically administers standards compliance on the bcuc behalf 
the clean energy act  which became law in british columbia in  sets out british columbia energy objectives 
this act states  among other things  that british columbia aims to accelerate and expand the development of clean and renewable energy sources british columbia to  among other things  achieve energy self sufficiency by  promote economic development and job creation and continue to work toward the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
this act also explicitly states that british columbia will encourage the use of waste heat  biogas and biomass to reduce waste 
this act is consistent with the british columbia government energy plan  introduced in  which favors clean and renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric  wind and wood waste electricity generation 
bc hydro is required to meet these objectives and submit reports to the bcuc updating on its progress 
other provincial regulators in british columbia having authority over independent power producers include the british columbia safety authority  the ministry of environment and the integrated land management bureau 
iii ontario  canada in ontario  the ontario energy board oeb is an administrative tribunal with overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the natural gas and electricity industries in ontario and with the authority to grant or renew  and set the terms for  licenses with respect to electricity generation facilities  including our projects 
no person is permitted to generate electricity in ontario without a license from the oeb 

table of contents the oeb general functions include determination of the rates charged for regulated services in the electricity sector  licensing of market participants  inspections  particularly with respect to compelling production of records and information  formulation of rules to govern the conduct of participants in the electricity market  market monitoring and reporting  including on anti competitive practice  consumer advocacy  and enforcement and compliance 
the oeb has the authority effectively to modify licenses by adopting codes that are deemed to form part of the licenses 
furthermore  any violations of the license or other irregularities in the relationship with the oeb can result in fines 
while the oeb provides reports to the ontario minister of energy  it generally operates independently from the government 
however  the minister may issue policy directives with cabinet approval concerning general policy and the objectives to be pursued by the oeb  and the oeb is required to implement such policy directives 
a number of other regulators and quasi governmental entities play a role in electricity regulation in ontario  including the independent electricity system operator ieso  hydro one  the electrical safety authority esa  oefc and the ontario power authority opa 
the ieso is responsible for administering the wholesale electricity market and controlling ontario transmission grid 
the ieso is a non profit corporation whose directors are appointed by the government of ontario 
the ieso market rules form the regulatory framework for the operation of ontario transmission grid and electricity market 
the market rules require  among other things  that generators meet certain equipment and performance standards and certain system reliability obligations 
the ieso may enforce the market rules by imposing financial penalties 
the ieso may also terminate  suspend or restrict participatory rights 
in november  the ieso entered into a memorandum of understanding with nerc  in which it recognized nerc as the electricity reliability organization in ontario 
in addition  the ieso has also entered into a similar mou with the northeast power coordinating council the npcc 
ieso is accountable to nerc and npcc for compliance with nerc and npcc reliability standards 
while ieso may impose ontario specific reliability standards  such standards must be consistent with  and at least as stringent as  nerc and npcc standards 
the opa was established in to  among other things  procure new electricity generation 
as a result  the opa enters into electricity generation contracts with electricity generators in ontario from time to time 
although we are not presently party to any such contracts  we may seek to enter into such contracts if and when the opportunity arises 
most of the operating assets of the entity formerly known as ontario hydro were transferred  in or around  to hydro one  ieso and a third company called ontario power generation inc the remaining assets and liabilities were kept in oefc 
once all of oefc debts approximately billion as of march have been retired  it will be wound up and its assets and liabilities will be transferred directly to the government of ontario 
the green energy act became law in ontario in renewable electricity generation technologies  including via a feed in tariff program 
this act states that the government of ontario is  among other things  committed to fostering the growth of renewable energy projects  to removing barriers to and promoting opportunities for renewable energy projects and to promoting a green economy 

table of contents carbon emissions in the united states  during the past several years government action addressing carbon emissions has been focused on the regional and state level 
beginning in  the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi was established in ten northeast and mid atlantic states as the first cap and trade program in the united states for co emissions 
these states have varied implementation plans and schedules 
the two states where we have project interests  new york and new jersey  also provide cost mitigation for independent power projects with certain types of power contracts 
at the end of  new jersey withdrew from the rggi program 
california cap and trade program governing greenhouse gas emissions became effective for the electricity sector on january  other states and regions in the united sates are developing similar regulations and it is possible that federal climate legislation will be established in the future 
at the federal level  president obama has identified climate change as one of the major priorities for his second term 
the us environmental protection agency has taken several recent actions respecting co emissions  including issuance of a finding that such emissions endanger public health and welfare  its final regulations to require annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by certain source categories considered to be large emitters  its final regulations to establish emissions standards for new fossil fuel power plants  and its anticipated proposed regulations to establish emissions standards for existing fossil fuel power plants 
additionally  more than half of the us states and most canadian provinces have set mandates requiring certain levels of renewable energy production and or energy efficiency during target timeframes 
this includes generation from wind  solar and biomass 
in order to meet co reduction goals  changes in the generation fuel mix are forecasted to include a reduction in existing coal resources  higher reliance on natural gas and renewable energy resources and an increase in demand side resources 
investments in new or upgraded transmission lines will be required to move increasing renewable generation from more remote locations to load centers 
regulatory incentives the us regulatory environment has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable energy generation and  in some cases  transmission 
certain us and canadian government policies support renewable power generation and other clean infrastructure technologies and enhance the economic feasibility of developing and operating energy projects in the regions in which we operate 
the viability of our current and potential future renewable energy projects  including our windpower projects  is largely contingent on public policy mechanisms and favorable regulatory incentives  including production and investment tax credits  stimulus grants from the us treasury and other types of cash grants  loan guarantees  accelerated depreciation tax benefits  state renewable portfolio standards  and regional carbon trading plans 
for example  the american taxpayer relief act was passed by congress on january  and signed into law by the president on january  this legislation extended production tax credits and investment tax credits for projects that start construction prior to january  and extended bonus depreciation for projects that are placed in service prior to january  under present law  the production tax credits provide an income tax credit of cents kilowatt hour for the production of electricity from utility scale wind turbines 
the ep act of also provides incentives for various forms of electric generation technologies 
governments from time to time may renew their policies that support renewable energy and consider actions to make the policies less conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities 
certain of our projects are eligible to receive grants and similar government incentives for the construction of renewable energy facilities 
we expect our piedmont and meadow creek projects to receive stimulus grant proceeds from the us treasury in the first half of however  because such 
table of contents grant proceeds are subject to congressional action  we cannot provide any assurances with respect to the timing  availability or amount  if any  of such grants 
we have also reduced expectations regarding the value of renewable energy credits in certain renewable projects 
tax equity investors in canadian hills are eligible for the income tax credit from production tax credits 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and our projects our renewable energy projects are subject to uncertainties regarding regulatory incentives 
employees as of february   we had employees  in the united states and in canada 
of our canadian employees  are covered by two collective bargaining agreements 
during  we did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of our facilities 
item a 
risk factors this section highlights specific risks that could affect our company 
you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
based on the information currently known to us  we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company 
however  the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones related to our business and are not necessarily listed in the order of their importance 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur  these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 
risks related to our business and our projects the expiration or termination of our power purchase agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition power generated by our projects  in most cases  is sold under ppas that expire at various times 
currently  our ppas are scheduled to expire between august and see item business our organization and segments for details about our projects ppas and related expiration dates 
in addition  these ppas may be subject to termination prior to expiration in certain circumstances  including default by the project 
when a ppa expires or is terminated  it may be difficult for us to secure a new ppa  if at all  or the price received by the project for power under subsequent arrangements may be reduced significantly 
it is possible that subsequent ppas may not be available at prices that permit the operation of the project on a profitable basis 
if this occurs  the affected project may temporarily or permanently cease operations and the value of the project may be impaired such that we would be required to record an impairment loss under applicable accounting rules 
the loss of significant ppas  or the breach by the other parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our projects depend on their electricity  thermal energy and transmission services customers and there is no assurance that these customers will perform their obligations or make required payments each of our projects relies on one or more ppas  steam sales agreements or other agreements with one or more utilities or other customers for a substantial portion of its revenue 
at times  we rely on a single customer or a limited number of customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a project output 
in  the largest customers of our power generation projects  including projects recorded 
table of contents under the equity method of accounting  are public service company of colorado  southwestern electric  and oefc which purchase approximately  and  respectively  of the net electric generation capacity of our projects 
if a customer stops purchasing output from our power generation projects or purchases less power than anticipated  such customer may be difficult to replace  if at all 
further concentration of our customers would increase our dependence on any one customer 
our cash flows and results of operations  including the amount of cash available to make payments on our indebtedness  are highly dependent upon customers under such agreements fulfilling their contractual obligations 
there is no assurance that these customers will perform their contractual obligations or make required payments 
certain of our projects are exposed to fluctuations in the price of electricity  which may have a material adverse effect on the operating margin of these projects and on our business  results of operations and financial condition those of our projects operating without a ppa or ppas based on spot market pricing for some or all of their output will be exposed to fluctuations in the wholesale price of electricity 
in addition  should any of the long term ppas expire or terminate  the relevant project will be required to either negotiate a new ppa or sell into the electricity wholesale market  in which case the prices for electricity will depend on market conditions at the time  which may not be favorable 
the open market wholesale prices for electricity are very volatile 
long and short term power prices may fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of our control  including changes in generation capacity in the electricity markets  including the addition of new supplies of power from existing competitors or new market entrants as a result of the development of new generation facilities  expansion of existing facilities or additional transmission capacity  electric supply disruptions  including plant outages and transmission disruptions  changes in power transmission infrastructure  fuel transportation capacity constraints  weather conditions  changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage  development of new fuels and new technologies for the production of power  development of new technologies for the production of natural gas  availability of competitively priced renewable fuel sources  available supplies of natural gas  crude oil and refined products  and coal  interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuation  availability and price of emission credits  geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas  general economic conditions which impact energy consumption in areas where we operate  and power market  fuel market and environmental regulation and legislation 
we are also exposed to market power prices at the selkirk  morris and chambers projects 
at chambers  our utility customer has the right to sell a portion of the plant output into the spot power market if it is economical to do so  and the chambers project shares in the profits from these sales 
in addition  during periods of low spot electricity prices the utility takes less generation  which negatively affects the project operating margin 
at morris  approximately of the facility capacity is 
table of contents currently not contracted 
the facility can generate and sell this excess capacity into the grid at market prices 
if market prices do not justify the increased generation  the project has no requirement to sell power at market 
at selkirk  approximately of the capacity of the facility is not contracted and is sold at market prices or not sold at all if market prices do not support the profitable operation of that portion of the facility 
as a result  fluctuations in the price of electricity may have a material adverse effect on the operating margins of these facilities and on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our projects depend on third party suppliers under fuel supply agreements  and increases in fuel costs may adversely affect the profitability of the projects the amount of energy generated at the projects is highly dependent on suppliers under certain fuel supply agreements fulfilling their contractual obligations 
the loss of significant fuel supply agreements or an inability or failure by any supplier to meet its contractual commitments may adversely affect our results 
upon the expiration or termination of existing fuel supply agreements  we or our project operators will have to renegotiate these agreements or may need to source fuel from other suppliers 
we may not be able to renegotiate these agreements or enter into new agreements on similar terms 
for example  the operating margin at our owned orlando project is exposed to changes in natural gas prices following the expiration of its fuel contract at the end of there can be no assurance as to availability of the supply or pricing of fuel under new arrangements  and it can be very difficult to accurately predict the future prices of fuel 
if our suppliers are unable to perform their contractual obligations or we are unable to renegotiate our fuel supply agreements  we may seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices  exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price 
changes in market prices for natural gas  biomass  coal and oil may result from the following weather conditions  seasonality  demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions  disruption or other constraints or inefficiencies of electricity  gas or coal transmission or transportation  additional generating capacity  availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks  natural gas  crude oil  refined products and coal production levels  changes in market liquidity  governmental regulation and legislation  and our creditworthiness and liquidity  and the willingness of fuel suppliers transporters to do business with us 
revenues earned by our projects may be affected by the availability  or lack of availability  of a stable supply of fuel at reasonable or predictable prices 
the price we can obtain for the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate  or may not rise at all  to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs 
to the extent possible  our projects attempt to match fuel cost setting mechanisms in supply agreements to energy payment formulas in the ppa and to provide for indexing or pass through of fuel costs to customers 
in cases where there is no pass through of fuel costs  we often attempt to mitigate the market price risk of changing commodity costs through the use of hedging strategies 
to the extent that 
table of contents costs are not matched well to ppa energy payments  pass through of fuel costs is not allowed or hedging strategies are unsuccessful  increases in fuel costs may adversely affect our results of operation 
this may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our energy payments at our orlando project are subject to fluctuations as the energy payments are comprised of a fuel component based on the cost of coal consumed at a nearby coal fired generating station 
our projects may not operate as planned the ability of our projects to meet availability requirements and generate the required amount of power to be sold to customers under the ppas are primary determinants of the amount of cash that will be distributed from the projects to us  and that will in turn be available for dividends paid to our shareholders 
there is a risk of equipment failure due to wear and tear  more frequent and or larger than forecasted downtimes for equipment maintenance and repair  latent defect  design error or operator error  or force majeure events  among other things  which could adversely affect revenues and cash flow 
unplanned outages of generation facilities  including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business 
unplanned outages typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues or require us to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy our obligations 
in general  our power generation projects transmit electric power to the transmission grid for purchase under the ppas through a single step up transformer 
as a result  the transformer represents a single point of vulnerability and may exhibit no abnormal behavior in advance of a catastrophic failure that could cause a temporary shutdown of the facility until a replacement transformer can be found or manufactured 
to the extent that we suffer disruptions of plant availability and power generation due to transformer failures or for any other reason  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition and the amount of cash available for dividends may be adversely affected 
we provide letters of credit under our million senior secured revolving credit facility for contractual credit support at some of our projects 
if the projects fail to perform under the related project level agreements  the letters of credit could be drawn and we would be required to reimburse our senior lenders for the amounts drawn 
the effects of weather and climate change may adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition our operations are affected by weather  which affects demand for electricity 
temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues  and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues 
moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenues 
to the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed  we may require greater resources to meet our contractual commitments 
these conditions  which cannot be accurately predicted  may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition by causing us to seek additional capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at a time when markets are weak 
to the extent climate change contributes to the frequency or intensity of weather related events  our operations and planning process could be impacted  which may adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents revenues from windpower projects are highly dependent on suitable wind and associated weather conditions and in the absence of such suitable conditions  our wind energy projects may not meet anticipated production levels  which could adversely affect our forecasted revenues we own interests in five windpower projects  which are subject to substantial risks 
the energy and revenues generated at a wind energy project are highly dependent on climatic conditions  particularly wind conditions  which are variable and difficult to predict 
turbines will only operate within certain wind speed ranges that vary by turbine model and manufacturer  and there is no assurance that the wind resources at any given project site will fall within such specifications 
we base our investment decisions with respect to each wind energy project on the findings of wind studies conducted on site before starting construction 
however  actual climatic conditions at a project site  particularly wind conditions  may not conform to the findings of these wind studies  and  therefore  our wind energy projects may not meet anticipated production levels  which could adversely affect our forecasted revenues 
revenues from hydropower projects are highly dependent on suitable precipitation and associated weather conditions and in the absence of such suitable conditions  our hydropower projects may not meet anticipated production levels  which could adversely affect our forecasted revenues 
we own interests in four hydropower projects  which are subject to substantial risks 
the energy and revenues generated at a hydro energy project are highly dependent on climatic conditions  particularly precipitation patterns  which are variable and difficult to predict for any given year 
we base our investment decisions with respect to each hydro energy project on the historical stream flow records for the area 
however  actual climatic conditions in any given year may not meet the historical averages which would impair our ability to meet anticipated production levels  which could adversely affect our forecasted revenues 
us  canadian and or global economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition our business may be affected by changes in us  canadian and or global economic conditions  including inflation  deflation  interest rates  availability of capital  consumer spending rates and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 
uncertainty about global economic conditions may cause consumers to alter behaviors that may directly or indirectly reduce energy spending  which could have a material adverse effect on demand for our product 
volatility in the financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
financial markets have also recently been affected by concerns over us fiscal policy  as well as the us federal government debt ceiling and federal deficit 
these concerns have also renewed discussions relating to a potential downgrade of the long term sovereign credit rating of the united states 
any actions taken by the us federal government regarding the debt ceiling or the federal deficit or any action taken or threatened by ratings agencies  could significantly impact the global and us economies and financial markets 
any such economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks that are beyond our control  including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war  natural disasters  or other catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition man made events  such as acts of terror and governmental responses to acts of terror  could adversely affect general economic conditions  which could have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
strategic targets  such as energy related facilities  may be 
table of contents at greater risk of future terrorist activities than other domestic targets 
our projects may be targets of terrorist activities  as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them  that could cause environmental repercussions and or result in full or partial disruption of the ability of the projects to generate and or transmit electricity 
any such environmental repercussions or other disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our projects could also be impacted by natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods  lightning activity  hurricanes  tropical storms  winter storms  tornadoes  wind  seismic activity  more frequent and more extreme weather events  changes in temperature and precipitation patterns  changes to ground and surface water availability  sea level rise and other related phenomena 
severe weather or other natural disasters could be destructive or otherwise disrupt our operations  which could result in increased costs 
we maintain standard insurance against catastrophic losses  which are subject to deductibles  limits and exclusions  however  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses 
future significant weather related events could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  natural disasters and other events that have an adverse effect on the economy in general may adversely affect our operations and our ability to raise capital 
our business faces significant operating hazards  natural disaster risks and other hazards such as fire and explosions and insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses our business involves significant operating hazards related to the generation of electricity  including hazards related to acquiring  transporting and unloading fuel  operating large pieces of rotating equipment  structural collapse  machinery failure  and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems 
in addition  we are exposed to natural disaster risks and other hazards such as fire and explosions 
these and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  plant and equipment  contamination of  or damage to  the environment and suspension of operations 
the occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages  including for environmental cleanup costs  personal injury and property damage and fines and or penalties 
while we believe that the projects maintain an amount of insurance coverage that is adequate and similar to what would be maintained by a prudent owner operator of similar facilities  and are subject to deductibles  limits and exclusions which are customary or reasonable given the cost of procuring insurance  current operating conditions and insurance market conditions  there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be offered on an economically feasible basis  nor that all events that could give rise to a loss or liability are insurable or insured  nor that the amounts of insurance will at all times be sufficient to cover each and every loss or claim that may occur involving our assets or operations of our projects 
any losses in excess of those covered by insurance  which may include a significant judgment against any project or project operator  the loss of a significant permit or other approval or the imposition of a significant fine or penalty  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and future prospects and could adversely affect dividends to our shareholders 
our operations are subject to the provisions of various energy laws and regulations our business is subject to extensive canadian and us federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulation 
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs  and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non complying facility  the imposition of liens  fines and or civil or criminal liability 

table of contents generally  in the united states  our projects are subject to regulation by the ferc regarding the terms and conditions of wholesale service and rates  as well as by state regulators regarding the prudency of utilities entering into ppas entered into by qf projects and the siting of the generation facilities 
the majority of our generation is sold by qf projects under ppas that required approval by state authorities 
the ep act of also limited the requirement that electric utilities buy electricity from qfs in certain markets that have certain competitive characteristics  potentially making it more difficult for our current and future projects to negotiate favorable ppas with these utilities 
if any project were to lose its status as a qf  it would lose its ability to make sales to utilities on favorable terms 
such project may no longer be entitled to exemption from provisions of puhca of or from certain provisions of the federal power act and state law and regulations 
loss of qf status could also trigger defaults under covenants to maintain that status in the ppas and project level debt agreements  and if not cured within allowed cure periods  could result in termination of agreements  penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under such agreements 
in such event  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
notwithstanding their status as qfs and ewgs  our facilities remain subject to numerous ferc regulations  including those relating to power marketer status  approval of mergers  acquisitions and investments relating to utilities  and mandatory reliability rules and regulations delegated to nerc 
any violation of these rules and regulations could subject us to significant fines and penalties and negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the ep act of and other federal and state programs also may provide incentives for various forms of electric generation technologies  which may subsidize our competitors 
the us regulatory environment has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting wholesale competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable energy generation and  in some cases  transmission 
these changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on our business 
in addition  in some of these markets  interested parties have proposed material market design changes  including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism as well as proposals to re regulate the markets 
other proposals to re regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process 
if competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed  discontinued  or delayed  or new law or other future regulatory developments are introduced  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
generally  in canada  our projects are subject to energy regulation primarily by the relevant provincial authorities 
in addition  our projects are subject to canada corporate  commercial and other laws of general application to businesses 
our projects require licenses  permits and approvals which can be in addition to any required environmental permits 
no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain  comply with and renew  as required  all necessary licenses  permits and approvals for these facilities 
if we cannot comply with and renew as required all applicable licenses  permits and approvals  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the introductions of new laws  or other future regulatory developments  may have a material adverse impact on our business  operations or financial condition 
risks with respect to the two canadian provinces where we currently have projects are addressed further below 

table of contents i british columbia the government of british columbia has a number of specific statutes and regulations that govern the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity within british columbia 
our projects in that province are subject to these laws 
these statutes can be changed by act of the provincial legislature and the regulations may be changed by the provincial cabinet 
such changes could have a material effect on our projects 
the clean energy act  which became law in british columbia in  sets out british columbia energy objectives  one of which is the generation of at least of the electricity in british columbia from clean or renewable resources 
bc hydro is required to submit resource plans outlining how it will meet these objectives and requires the province to be energy self sufficient by bc hydro is generally required to acquire all new power beyond what it already generates from existing bc hydro plants from independent power producers 
two of our three british columbia projects currently sell all of their electricity to bc hydro  and the third project sells substantially all of its electricity to bc hydro 
therefore  changes to bc hydro energy procurement policies and financial difficulties of or regulatory intervention in respect of bc hydro and or the province energy objectives could impact the market for electricity generated by our british columbia projects although bc hydro is currently limited by regulation to undertaking efficiency improvements at its existing facilities and only undertaking development of new generation facilities projects with bcuc approval 
there is a risk that the regulatory regime could adversely affect the amount of power that bc hydro purchases from our projects and the competitive environment or the price at which bc hydro is willing to purchase power from our british columbia projects the utilities commission act governs the bcuc  which is responsible for the regulation of british columbia public energy utilities  which include publicly owned and investor owned utilities ie  independent power producers 
all contracts for electricity supply  including those between independent power producers and bc hydro  must be filed with and approved by the bcuc as being in the public interest 
the bcuc may hold a hearing in this regard 
furthermore  the bcuc may impose conditions to be contained in agreements entered into by public utilities for electricity 
consequently  power procurement is controlled by the bcuc and  as a result  our potential contracts with bc hydro may be subject to terms that adversely affect us 
ii ontario the government of ontario has a number of specific statutes and regulations that govern our projects in that province 
the statutes can be changed by act of the provincial legislature and the regulations may be changed by the provincial cabinet 
such changes could have a material effect on our projects 
in ontario  the oeb is an administrative tribunal with authority to grant or renew  and set the terms for  licenses with respect to electricity generation facilities  including our projects 
no person is permitted to generate electricity in ontario without a license from the oeb 
while all of our ontario projects are currently licensed  the oeb has the authority to effectively modify the licenses by adopting codes that are deemed to form part of the licenses 
furthermore  any violations of the license or other irregularities in the relationship with the oeb can result in fines 
while the oeb provides reports to the ontario minister of energy  it generally operates independently from the government 
however  the minister may issue policy directives with cabinet approval concerning general policy and the objectives to be pursued by the oeb  and the oeb is required to implement such policy directives 
thus  the oeb regulation of our projects is subject to potential political interference  to a degree 
a number of other regulators and quasi governmental entities play a role  including the ieso  hydro one  the energy safety authority  oefc and opa 
all these agencies may affect our projects 

table of contents noncompliance with federal reliability standards may subject us and our projects to penalties many of our operations are subject to the regulations of nerc  a self regulatory non governmental organization which has statutory responsibility to regulate bulk power system users and generation and transmission owners and operators 
nerc groups the users  owners  and operators of the bulk power system into categories  known as functional entities eg  generator owner  generator operator  purchasing selling entity  etc 
according to the tasks they perform 
the nerc compliance registry lists the entities responsible for complying with federal mandatory reliability standards and the ferc  nerc  or a regional reliability organization may assess penalties against any responsible entity found to be in noncompliance 
violations may be discovered or identified through self certification  compliance audits  spot checking  self reporting  compliance investigations by nerc or a regional reliability organization and the ferc  periodic data submissions  exception reporting  and complaints 
the penalty that could be imposed for violating the requirements of the standards is a function of the violation risk factor 
penalties for the most severe violations can reach as high as million per violation  per day  and our projects could be exposed to these penalties if violations occur  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our projects are subject to significant environmental and other regulations our projects are subject to numerous and significant federal  state  provincial and local laws  including statutes  regulations  by laws  guidelines  policies  directives and other requirements governing or relating to  among other things air emissions  discharges into water  ash disposal  the storage  handling  use  transportation and distribution of dangerous goods and hazardous  residual and other regulated materials  such as chemicals  the prevention of releases of hazardous materials into the environment  the prevention  presence and remediation of hazardous materials in soil and groundwater  both on and off site  land use and zoning matters  and workers health and safety matters 
our facilities could experience incidents  malfunctions or other unplanned events that could result in spills or emissions in excess of permitted levels and result in personal injury  penalties and property damage 
as such  the operation of our projects carries an inherent risk of environmental  health and safety liabilities including potential civil actions  compliance or remediation orders  fines and other penalties  and may result in the projects being involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters 
we have implemented environmental  health and safety management programs designed to regularly improve environmental  health and safety performance  but there is no guarantee that such programs will fully and effectively eliminate the inherent risk of environmental  health and safety liabilities related to the operation of our projects 
environmental laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time  and this trend may continue 
in the united states  the clean air act and related regulations and programs of the environmental protection agency the epa extensively regulate the air emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides  mercury and other compounds by power plants 
in march  the epa promulgated the clean air interstate rule cair  which requires states and the district of columbia to curb emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants through participation in a cap and trade system or more aggressive state by state emissions limits 
although implementation of the cair is underway  the epa is subject to a court order to develop a more stringent replacement rule 
other more stringent epa air emission regulations currently being implemented include the more stringent national ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide  issued in june  and for fine particulate matter  issued in december  and the new mercury and air toxics emissions standards for power plants  issued in december meeting these new standards  when implemented  may have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the us resource conservation and recovery act has historically exempted fossil fuel combustion wastes from hazardous waste regulation 
however  in june the epa proposed two alternative sets of regulations governing coal ash 
one alternative would designate coal ash as special waste and bring ash impoundments at coal fired power plants under federal regulations governing hazardous solid waste under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act 
another alternative would regulate coal ash as a non hazardous solid waste 
if the epa determines to regulate coal ash as a hazardous waste  our owned coal fired facility may be subject to increased compliance obligations and associated costs that may have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
similar increasingly stringent environmental regulations also apply to our projects in british columbia and ontario 
significant costs may be incurred for either capital expenditures or the purchase of allowances under any or all of these programs to keep the projects compliant with environmental laws and regulations 
the projects ppas do not allow for the pass through of emissions allowance or emission reduction capital expenditure costs 
if it is not economical to make those expenditures  it may be necessary to retire or mothball facilities  or restrict or modify our operations to comply with more stringent standards 
our projects have obtained environmental permits and other approvals that are required for their operations 
compliance with applicable environmental laws  regulations  permits and approvals and material future changes to them could materially impact our businesses 
although we believe the operations of the projects are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental laws  licenses  permits and other authorizations required for the operation of the projects  and although there are environmental monitoring and reporting systems in place with respect to all the projects  there is no guarantee that more stringent laws will not be imposed  that there will not be more stringent enforcement of applicable laws or that such systems may not fail  which may result in material expenditures 
failure by the projects to comply with any environmental  health or safety requirements  or increases in the cost of such compliance  including as a result of unanticipated liabilities or expenditures for investigation  assessment  remediation or prevention  could result in additional expense  capital expenditures  restrictions and delays in the projects activities  the extent of which cannot be predicted and which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional regulatory requirements are imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or requiring efficiency improvements  such requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of our projects uneconomical to maintain or operate the epa  other regulatory agencies  environmental advocacy groups and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on greenhouse gas emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change 
we expect that additional epa regulations  and possibly additional legislation and or regulation by other regulatory authorities  may be issued  resulting in the imposition of additional limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or requiring efficiency improvements from fossil fuel fired electric generating units 
there are also potential impacts on our natural gas businesses as greenhouse gas legislation or regulations may require greenhouse gas emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas 
additionally  greenhouse gas requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products  as well as increase competition surrounding such innovation 
additionally  our reputation could be damaged due to public perception surrounding greenhouse gas emissions at our power generation projects 
any such negative public perception could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution 
several regions of the united states and canada have moved forward with greenhouse gas emission regulation 

table of contents for example  the multi state carbon dioxide co cap and trade program  known as the regional greenhouse gas initiative  applies to our fossil fuel facilities in the northeast region 
the regional greenhouse gas initiative program went into effect on january  co allowances are now a tradable commodity 
california  british columbia and ontario are part of the western climate initiative  which is developing a regional cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region to below levels by in  the state of california passed legislation initiating two programs to control reduce the creation of greenhouse gases 
the two laws are more commonly known as ab and sb under ab the global warming solutions act  the california air resources board the carb is required to adopt a greenhouse gas emissions cap on all major sources not limited to the electric sector to reduce state wide emissions of greenhouse gases to levels by under the carb regulations that took effect on january   electricity generators and certain other facilities are now subject to an allowance for greenhouse gas emissions  with allowances allocated by both formulas set by the carb and auctions 
sb added the requirement that the california energy commission  in consultation with the california public utilities commission the cpuc and the carb  establish greenhouse gas emission performance standards and implement regulations for ppas for a term of five or more years entered into prospectively by publicly owned electric utilities 
the legislation directs the california energy commission to establish the performance standard as one not exceeding the rate of greenhouse gas emitted per megawatt hour mwh associated with combined cycle  gas turbine baseload generation  such as our north island project 
in addition to the regional initiatives  president obama has declared action addressing climate change to be a major priority for his second term  and the epa has taken several recent actions for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions 
the epa actions include its december finding of endangerment to public health and welfare from greenhouse gases  its issuance in september of the final mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule which required large sources  including power plants  to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions to the epa annually  which was required beginning in  and its issuance in may of its final prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  which under a phased in approach requires large industrial facilities  including power plants  to obtain permits to emit  and to use best available control technology to curb emissions of  greenhouse gases 
in addition  final epa regulations to impose greenhouse gas new source performance standards for electricity utility stream generating units are anticipated in in canada  british columbia and ontario have implemented greenhouse gas reporting regulations and are developing additional programs to address greenhouse gas emissions 
all of our subject generating facilities have complied on a timely basis with the new epa and ontario greenhouse gas reporting requirements 
compliance with greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements may require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at our natural gas projects  committing significant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology  purchase of allowances and or offsets  fuel switching  and or retirement of high emitting projects and potential replacement with lower emitting projects 
the cost of compliance with greenhouse gas emission legislation and or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables  including timing of the implementation of rules  required levels of reductions  allocation requirements of the new rules  the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technology  and the selected compliance alternatives 
we cannot estimate the aggregate effect of such requirements on our business  results of operations  financial condition or our customers 
however  
table of contents such expenditures  if material  could make our generation facilities uneconomical to operate  result in the impairment of assets  or otherwise adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our renewable energy projects are subject to uncertainties regarding regulatory incentives we depend  in part  on government policies that support renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of developing and operating energy projects in the regions in which we operate 
the viability of our renewable energy projects  including our windpower projects  is largely contingent on public policy mechanisms and favorable regulatory incentives in the united states and canada  including production and investment tax credits  cash grants  loan guarantees  accelerated depreciation tax benefits  renewable portfolio standards  and carbon trading plans 
these mechanisms have been implemented in the united states and canada to support the development of renewable power generation and other clean infrastructure technologies 
however  as a result of budgetary constraints  political factors or otherwise  governments from time to time may review their policies that support renewable energy and consider actions to make the policies less conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities 
we have reduced expectations regarding the value of renewable energy credits in certain renewable projects 
pursuant to the sequestration transparency act of the sta  on september   the white house office of management and budget the omb released an initial report on the potential sequestration triggered by the failure of the joint select committee on deficit reduction to propose  and congress to enact  a plan to reduce the deficit by trillion  as required by the budget control act of the bca 
the sequester is expected to become effective in march if congress does not enact a comprehensive deficit reduction package 
the omb report estimated a reduction of grants awarded by the treasury program grants in fiscal year we expect our piedmont and meadow creek projects to receive grant proceeds from the us treasury in the first half of  which we plan to use to repay project level debt financing at the piedmont and meadow creek projects 
we cannot provide any assurances with respect to the timing  availability or amount  if any  of such stimulus grants  because such grants proceeds are subject to congressional action 
if we do not receive such grants  or such grants are delayed or reduced  our ability to repay the project level debt financing at the piedmont and meadow creek projects will be adversely affected 
any reductions to  or the elimination of  governmental incentives that support renewable energy  or the imposition of additional taxes or other assessments on renewable energy  could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
increasing competition could adversely affect our performance and the performance of our projects the power generation industry is characterized by intense competition and our projects encounter competition from utilities  industrial companies and other independent power producers  in particular with respect to uncontracted output 
in recent years  there has been increasing competition among generators for ppas  and this has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets where supply has surpassed demand plus appropriate reserve margins 
in addition  we continue to confront significant competition for acquisition and investment opportunities and  to the extent that any opportunities are identified  we may be unable to effect acquisitions or investments on attractive terms  if at all 
increasing competition among participants in the power generation industry may adversely affect our performance and the performance of our projects 
we have limited control over management decisions at certain projects going forward  approximately one third of our projects are not wholly owned by us or we have contracted for their operations and maintenance  and in some cases we have limited control over the operation of the projects 
although we generally prefer to acquire projects where we have control  we 
table of contents may make acquisitions in non control situations to the extent that we consider it advantageous to do so and consistent with regulatory requirements and restrictions  including the investment company act of third party operators such as cem  ppms and dps operate many of the projects 
as such  we must rely on the technical and management expertise of these third party operators although typically we negotiate to obtain positions on a management or operating committee if we do not own of a project 
to the extent that such third party operators do not fulfill their obligations to manage the operations of the projects or are not effective in doing so  the amount of cash available to pay dividends may be adversely affected 
the approval of third party operators also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer our interest in projects 
our inability to control fully certain projects could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may face significant competition for acquisitions and may not successfully integrate acquisitions our business plan includes growth through identifying suitable acquisition opportunities  pursuing such opportunities  consummating acquisitions and effectively integrating them with our business 
we may be unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates in the power industry in the future  and we may not be able to make acquisitions on an accretive basis or be sure that acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our existing operations  any of which could negatively impact our ability to continue paying dividends in the future 
although electricity demand is expected to grow  creating the need for more generation  and the us power industry is continuing to undergo consolidation and may offer attractive acquisition opportunities  we are likely to confront significant competition for those opportunities and  to the extent that any opportunities are identified  we may be unable to effect acquisitions or investments 
any acquisition or investment may involve potential risks  including an increase in indebtedness  the inability to successfully integrate operations  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the diversion of management attention from other business concerns and the possibility that we pay more than the acquired company or interest is worth 
there may also be liabilities that we fail to discover  or are unable to discover  in our due diligence prior to the consummation of an acquisition  and we may not be indemnified for some or all these liabilities 
in addition  our funding requirements associated with acquisitions and integration costs may reduce the funds available to us to make dividend payments 
our equity interests in certain projects may be subject to transfer restrictions the partnership or other agreements governing some of the projects may limit a partner ability to sell its interest 
specifically  these agreements may prohibit any sale  pledge  transfer  assignment or other conveyance of the interest in a project without the consent of the other partners 
in some cases  other partners may have rights of first offer or rights of first refusal in the event of a proposed sale or transfer of our interest 
these restrictions may limit or prevent us from managing our interests in these projects in the manner we see fit  and may have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our interests in these projects at the prices we desire 
the projects are exposed to risks inherent in the use of derivative instruments we and the projects may use derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  to manage commodity and financial market risks 
these activities  though intended to mitigate price volatility  expose us to other risks 
in the future  the project operators could recognize financial losses on these arrangements  including as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities  if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract or upon the failure or insolvency of a financial intermediary  exchange or clearinghouse used to enter  execute or clear the transactions 
if 
table of contents actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources are not available  the valuation of these contracts would involve judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
most of these contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded currently in the statement of operations  resulting in significant volatility in our income loss as calculated in accordance with gaap that does not significantly affect current period cash flows or the underlying risk management purpose of the derivative instruments 
as a result  we may be unable to accurately predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on our quarterly and annual income loss as calculated in accordance with gaap 
if the values of these financial contracts change in a manner that we do not anticipate  or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract  it could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have executed natural gas swaps to reduce our risks to changes in the market price of natural gas  which is the fuel consumed at many of our projects 
due to declining natural gas prices  we have incurred losses on these natural gas swaps 
we execute these swaps only for the purpose of managing risks and not for speculative trading 
we do not typically hedge the entire exposure of our operations against commodity price volatility 
to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity prices 
construction projects are subject to construction risk we are in the process of developing or constructing new generation facilities 
in any construction project  there is a risk that circumstances occur which prevent the timely completion of a project  cause construction costs to exceed the level budgeted  or result in operating performance standards or permit requirements not being met 
successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks  including  but not limited to  risks relating to siting  financing  construction  permitting  governmental approvals or commissioning delays 
in the event a power project does not achieve commercial operation by its expected date  the project may be subject to increased construction costs associated with the continuing accrual of interest on the project construction loan  which customarily matures at the start of commercial operation and converts to a term loan 
a delay in completion of construction may also impact a project under its ppa which may include penalty provisions for a delay in commercial operation date or in situations of extreme delay  termination of the ppa 
construction cost overruns which exceed the project construction contingency amount may require that the project owner infuse additional funds in order to complete construction 
at the completion of construction  the power project may not meet its expected operating performance levels 
adverse circumstances may impact the design  construction  and commissioning of the project that could result in reduced output  increased heat rate or excessive air emissions 
the piedmont project commenced construction in november and is expected to be completed in early a delay in completion could result in the delay and or loss of the proceeds from the grant 
certain employees are subject to collective bargaining a number of our plant employees  from one plant in british columbia and four plants in ontario are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
these agreements expire periodically and we may not be able to renew them without a labor disruption or without agreeing to significant increases in labor costs 
strikes  work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on 
table of contents favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our pension plan may require additional future contributions certain of our employees in canada are participants in a defined benefit pension plan that we sponsor 
as of december   our pension plan was under funded on a going concern basis by approximately million 
the additional amount of future contributions to our defined benefit plan will depend upon asset returns and a number of other factors and  as a result  the amounts we will be required to contribute in the future may vary 
cash contributions to the plan will reduce the cash available for our business 
hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair our operations  lead to the disclosure of confidential information  damage our reputation and otherwise have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition a cyber intrusion is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality  integrity or availability of our information resources 
more specifically  a cyber intrusion is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations  corrupt data or steal confidential information 
we are dependent on various information technologies throughout our company to carry out multiple business activities 
further  the computer systems that run our facilities are not completely isolated from external networks 
parties that wish to disrupt the us and or canadian bulk power system or our operations could view our computer systems  software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack 
in addition  our business requires that we collect and maintain confidential employee and shareholder information  which is subject to electronic theft or loss 
a successful cyber attack  such as unauthorized access  malicious software or other violations on the systems that control generation and transmission at our projects could severely disrupt business operations  diminish competitive advantages through reputation damages and increase operation costs 
the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record  process and report financial information 
a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation  fines  other remedial action  heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation 
for these reasons  a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and or the canadian corruption of foreign public officials act could subject us to  among other things  penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition we are subject to anti corruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the canadian corruption of foreign public officials act the cfpoa  which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and or other benefits 
in addition  the fcpa imposes accounting standards and requirements on us publicly traded corporations and their foreign affiliates  which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments  and to prevent the establishment of off books slush funds from which improper payments can be made similar provisions have been proposed to be added to the cfpoa 
the securities and exchange commission has increased its enforcement of the fcpa during the past several years 
in recent years  enforcement of the cfpoa in canada has also increased and can be attributed  in part  to the establishment of the royal canadian mounted police international anti corruption unit in although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we  our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and or the cfpoa  
table of contents there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa and or the cfpoa for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire 
if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and or the cfpoa  we may be subject to criminal penalties pursuant to the cfpoa and or criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures pursuant to the fcpa  including changes or enhancements to our procedures  policies and control  as well as potential personnel change and disciplinary actions  which could have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends in part on our ability to retain  motivate and recruit executives and other key employees  and failure to do so could negatively affect us our success depends in part on our ability to retain  recruit and motivate key employees who have experience in our industry 
experienced employees in the power industry are in high demand and competition for their talents can be intense 
a failure to attract and retain executives and other key employees with specialized knowledge in power generation could have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements 
risks related to our structure volatile capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms and may adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the united states  canada or abroad can adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 
our access to funds under that credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time 
longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could result in an inability to execute our growth plan  the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures  changes to our hedging strategy to reduce collateral posting requirements  or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash 
our ability to arrange for financing on a recourse or non recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control  including general economic and capital market conditions  the availability of bank credit  investor confidence  our financial condition  performance and prospects as well as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances  and changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital 
should future access to capital not be available to us  either as a result of market conditions or our financial condition  we may have to sell assets or decide not to acquire new projects or expand or improve existing projects  either of which would adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents future dividends are not guaranteed dividends to shareholders are paid at the discretion of our board of directors 
future dividends  if any  will depend on  among other things  the results of operations  working capital requirements  financial condition  restrictive covenants  business opportunities  provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
our board of directors may decrease the level of or entirely discontinue payment of dividends 
distribution of available cash may restrict our potential growth a payout of a significant portion of our operating cash flow may make additional capital and operating expenditures dependent on increased cash flow or additional financing in the future 
lack of these funds could limit our future growth and cash flow 
in addition  we may be precluded from pursuing otherwise attractive acquisitions or investments if the projected short term cash flow from the acquisition or investment is not adequate to service the capital raised to fund the acquisition or investment 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional details on cash available for distribution 
exchange rate fluctuations may impact the amount of cash available for dividends our payments to shareholders  some of our corporate level long term debt and convertible debenture holders are denominated in canadian dollars 
conversely  some of our projects revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
our debt instruments are revalued at each balance sheet date based on the us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date  with changes in the value of the debt recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate has been volatile in recent years  which in turn creates volatility in our results due to the revaluation of our canadian dollar denominated debt 
as a result  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risks  against which we do not typically hedge our entire exposure 
despite our partial hedges against this risk through  any arrangements to mitigate this exchange rate risk may not be sufficient to fully protect against this risk 
if hedging transactions do not fully protect against this risk  changes in the currency exchange rate between us and canadian dollars could adversely affect our cash available for distribution 
our indebtedness and financing arrangements  and any failure to comply with the covenants contained therein  could negatively impact our business and our projects and could render us unable to make cash distributions  acquisitions or investments or issue additional indebtedness we otherwise would seek to do the degree to which we are leveraged on a consolidated basis could have important consequences for our shareholders and other stakeholders  including our ability in the future to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  our ability to refinance indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all  our ability to satisfy debt service and other obligations  our vulnerability to general adverse industry conditions and economic conditions  including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices  the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged 

table of contents as of december   our consolidated long term debt represented approximately of our total capitalization  comprised of debt and balance sheet equity 
the agreements governing our indebtedness limit but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
our current or future borrowings could increase the level of financial risk to us and  to the extent that the interest rates are not fixed and rise  or that borrowings are refinanced at higher rates  then cash available for dividends could be adversely affected 
changes in interest rates do not have a significant impact on cash payments that are required on our debt instruments as approximately of our debt  including our share of the project level debt associated with equity investments in affiliates  either bears interest at fixed rates or is financially hedged through the use of interest rate swaps 
as of february   we had million outstanding and million was issued in letters of credit under our revolving credit facility  million of outstanding convertible debentures  million of outstanding non recourse project level debt  and billion of unsecured notes 
although we expect to repay the amounts outstanding under the credit facility with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the florida projects expected to close in the remaining part of the first quarter of  our credit facility is a primary source of our liquidity  see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our credit facility contains financial covenants  covenants requiring us to take certain actions and negative covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions 
although we currently expect to remain in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility through late  we are considering a variety of measures to reduce our leverage 
if we are unsuccessful or other adverse events occur  we may breach one or more of these covenants  which would result in a default under the credit facility or would prevent us from taking certain actions that are not permitted under the credit facility unless certain covenants are met  including making distributions  making certain acquisitions  investments or capital expenditures  and refinancing or issuing debt  that we otherwise would seek to do 
in such case  we may be required to seek waivers or consents from our lenders or amendments to our credit facility  or may be required to seek to refinance our credit facility  and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to accomplish any such actions on terms acceptable to us or at all  and we will otherwise be in default under our credit facility  which would enable lenders thereunder to accelerate the repayment of amounts outstanding and exercise remedies with respect to collateral 
our ability to amend our credit facility or otherwise obtain waivers from our lenders depends on matters that are outside of our control and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in that regard 
in the event we are not able to refinance our credit facility or obtain waivers or consents  our business may be materially adversely affected  including with respect to our ability to take the actions described above 
in addition  some of the projects currently have non recourse term loans or other financing arrangements in place with various lenders 
these financing arrangements are typically secured by all of the project assets and contracts as well as our equity interests in the project 
the terms of these financing arrangements generally impose many covenants and obligations on the part of the borrower 
for example  some agreements contain requirements to maintain specified historical  and in some cases prospective debt service coverage ratios before cash may be distributed from the relevant project to us  which would adversely affect cash available for dividends 
in many cases  an uncured default by any party under key project agreements such as a ppa or a fuel supply agreement will also constitute a default under the project term loan or other financing arrangement 
failure to comply with the terms of these term loans or other financing arrangements  or events of default thereunder  may prevent cash distributions by the particular project s to us and may entitle the lenders to demand repayment and or enforce their security interests  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  failure to comply with the terms  restrictions or obligations of any of our revolving credit facility  convertible debentures or unsecured notes or any other financing arrangements  borrowings or indebtedness  or events of default thereunder  may entitle 
table of contents the lenders to demand repayment  accelerate related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross default or cross acceleration provision applies and or enforce their security interests  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our lenders under our indebtedness demand payment  we may not  at that time  have sufficient cash and cash flows from operating activities to repay such indebtedness 
our failure to refinance or repay any indebtedness when due could constitute a default under such indebtedness 
under such circumstances  it is expected that dividends to our shareholders would not be permitted until such indebtedness was refinanced or repaid 
in addition  any covenant breach or event of default could harm our credit rating and our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
a downgrade in our credit rating or any deterioration in credit quality could negatively affect our ability to access capital and our ability to hedge  and could trigger termination rights under certain contracts a downgrade in our credit rating or deterioration in credit quality could adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities  restrict access to our revolving credit facility and or trigger termination rights or enhanced disclosure requirements under certain contracts to which we are a party 
any downgrade of our corporate credit rating could cause counterparties to require us to post letters of credit or other additional collateral  make cash prepayments  obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other security  all of which would expose us to additional costs and or could adversely affect our ability to comply with covenants or other obligations under any of our revolving credit facility  convertible debentures or unsecured notes or any other financing arrangements  borrowings or indebtedness or could constitute an event of default under any such financing arrangements  borrowings or indebtedness that we may be unable to cure  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in our creditworthiness may affect the value of our common shares changes to our perceived creditworthiness and ability to meet our required covenants on an on going basis may affect the market price or value and the liquidity of our common shares 
the interest rate we pay on our credit facility may increase if certain credit ratios deteriorate 
the future issuance of additional common shares could dilute existing shareholders from time to time  we may decide to issue additional common shares  redeem outstanding debt for common shares  to repay outstanding principal amounts under existing debt by issuing common shares or issue common shares to meet growth objectives 
the issuance of additional common shares may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and may adversely impact the price of our common shares 
we have guaranteed the performance of some of our subsidiaries  which may result in substantial costs in the event of non performance we have issued certain guarantees of the performance of some of our subsidiaries in certain situations  which obligates us to perform in the event that the subsidiaries do not perform 
in the event of non performance by the subsidiaries  we could incur substantial cost to fulfill our obligations under these guarantees 
such performance guarantees could have a material impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for information on our guarantee obligations 

table of contents we have anti takeover protections that may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our shareholders 
the bcbca and our articles of continuance contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors board 
these provisions include as a notice of meeting is required to include certain particulars in the case where a shareholder meeting is being requisitioned by shareholders  our board must be given advance notice regarding special business that is to be brought by such requisitioning shareholders before the shareholder meeting 
for special business  advance notice describing the special business to be discussed at the meeting must be provided and that notice must include any documents to be approved or ratified as an addendum or state that such document will be available for inspection at our records office or other reasonably accessible location 
under the bcbca  shareholders may make proposals for matters to be considered at the annual general meeting of shareholders  provided that such shareholders represent at least of the voting shares of a company or such shares have a fair market value of at least cdn  such proposals must be sent to us in advance of any proposed meeting by delivering a timely written notice in proper form to our registered office 
the notice must include information on the business the shareholder intends to bring before the meeting 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying until the next shareholder meeting shareholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities 
casual vacancies on our board can be filled until the next annual meeting of shareholders by the directors of our board 
a change of control will also result in an event of default under our credit facility and will permit holders of our convertible debentures to require that we purchase the debentures upon the conditions set forth in the respective indenture governing the debentures  which may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or the acquisition of a substantial block of our common shares 
we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan that may discourage or delay a change of control or the acquisition of a substantial block of our common shares and may make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult 
under the rights plan the rights will generally become exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of atlantic power outstanding common shares unless such transaction is a permitted bid or a transaction to which the application of the shareholders rights plan has been waived pursuant to the terms of the plan and thus becomes an acquiring person 
a permitted bid is an offer pursuant to which  among other things  such person or group agrees to hold the offer open to all shareholders for a period longer than the statutorily required period 
each right  when exercisable  will entitle the holder  other than the acquiring person  to acquire shares of atlantic power common shares at a significant discount to the then prevailing market price 
as a result  the rights plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that becomes an acquiring person and may discourage or delay a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
our common shares may not continue to be qualified investments under canadian tax laws there can be no assurance that our common shares will continue to be qualified investments under relevant canadian tax laws for trusts governed by registered retirement savings plans  registered 
table of contents retirement income funds  deferred profit sharing plans  registered education savings plans  registered disability savings plans and tax free savings accounts 
canadian tax laws impose penalties for the acquisition or holding of non qualified or ineligible investments 
we are subject to canadian tax as a canadian corporation  we are generally subject to canadian federal  provincial and other taxes  and dividends paid by us are generally subject to canadian withholding tax if paid to a shareholder that is not a resident of canada 
we hold a promissory note from our primary us holding company the intercompany note and are required to include  in computing our taxable income  interest on the intercompany note 
on november   we acquired directly and indirectly  all of the outstanding limited partnership units of the partnership pursuant to a court approved plan of arrangement 
we are required to include the income or loss from the partnership in our taxable income 
we expect that our existing tax attributes initially will be available to offset the income inclusions noted herein such that they will not result in an immediate material increase to our liability for canadian taxes 
however  once we fully utilize our existing tax attributes or if  for any reason  these attributes were not available to us  our canadian tax liability would materially increase 
although we intend to explore potential opportunities in the future to preserve the tax efficiency of our structure  no assurances can be given that our canadian tax liability will not materially increase at that time 
canadian federal income tax laws and policies could be changed in a manner which adversely affects holders of our common shares there can be no assurance that canadian federal income tax laws and canada revenue agency administrative policies respecting the canadian federal income tax consequences generally applicable to us  to our subsidiaries  or to a us or canadian holder of common shares will not be changed in a manner which adversely affects holders of our common shares 
our prior and current structure may be subject to additional us federal income tax liability under our prior ips structure  we treated the subordinated notes as debt for us federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we deducted the interest payments on the subordinated notes and reduced our net taxable income treated as effectively connected income for us federal income tax purposes 
under our current structure  our subsidiaries that are incorporated in the united states are subject to us federal income tax on their income at regular corporate rates currently as high as  plus state and local taxes  and one of our us holding companies will claim interest deductions with respect to the intercompany note in computing its income for us federal income tax purposes 
the partnership acquisition added another us holding company to our structure 
this holding company owns the us operating assets of the partnership 
this group currently has certain intercompany financing arrangements the partnership financing arrangements in place 
we claim interest deductions in the united states with respect to the partnership financing arrangements 
to the extent any interest expense under the subordinated notes  the intercompany note or the partnership financing arrangements is disallowed or is otherwise not deductible  the us federal income tax liability of our us holding companies will increase  which could materially affect the after tax cash available to distribute to us 
while we received advice from our us tax counsel at the time of the issuance  based on certain representations by us and our us holding companies and determinations made by our independent advisors  as applicable  that the subordinated notes and the intercompany note should be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes  and the partnership has received advice from its us accountants  based on certain representations by its holding companies  that the payments on the 
table of contents partnership financing arrangements should be deductible for us federal income tax purposes  it is possible that the internal revenue service the irs could successfully challenge these positions and assert that any of these arrangements should be treated as equity rather than debt for us federal income tax purposes or that the interest on such arrangements is otherwise not deductible 
in this case  the otherwise deductible interest would be treated as non deductible distributions and  in the case of the intercompany note and the partnership financing arrangements  may be subject to us withholding tax to the extent our respective us holding company had current or accumulated earnings and profits 
the determination of debt or equity treatment for us federal income tax purposes is based on an analysis of the facts and circumstances 
there is no clear statutory definition of debt for us federal income tax purposes  and its characterization is governed by principles developed in case law  which analyzes numerous factors that are intended to identify the nature of the purported creditor interest in the borrower 
not all courts have applied this analysis in the same manner  and some courts have placed more emphasis on certain factors than other courts have 
to the extent it were ultimately determined that our interest expense on the subordinated notes  the intercompany note or the partnership financing arrangements were disallowed  our us federal income tax liability for the applicable open tax years would materially increase  which could materially affect the after tax cash available to us to distribute 
alternatively  the irs could argue that the interest on the subordinated notes  the intercompany note or the partnership financing arrangements exceeded or exceeds an arm length rate  in which case only the portion of the interest expense that does not exceed an arm length rate may be deductible and the remainder may be subject to us withholding tax to the extent our us holding companies had current or accumulated earnings and profits 
we have received advice from independent advisors that the interest rate on these debt instruments was and is  as applicable  commercially reasonable under the circumstances  but the advice is not binding on the irs 
furthermore  our us holding companies deductions attributable to the interest expense on the intercompany note and or certain of the partnership financing arrangements may be limited by the amount by which each us holding company net interest expense the interest paid by each us holding company on all debt  including the intercompany note and the partnership financing arrangements  less its interest income exceeds of its adjusted taxable income generally  us federal taxable income before net interest expense  net operating loss carryovers  depreciation and amortization 
any disallowed interest expense may currently be carried forward to future years 
in addition  if our us holding companies do not make regular interest payments as required under these debt agreements  other limitations on the deductibility of interest under us federal income tax laws could apply to defer and or eliminate all or a portion of the interest deduction that our us holding companies would otherwise be entitled to 
finally  the applicability of recent changes to the us canada income tax treaty to the structure associated with certain of the partnership financing arrangements may result in distributions from the partnership us group to its canadian parent being subject to a rate of withholding tax instead of the rate that would otherwise have applied 
our us holding companies have existing net operating loss carryforwards that we can utilize to offset future taxable income 
our us holding companies include the partnership us holding company  atlantic power us gp  which has net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax years prior to our acquisition 
it is anticipated that these net operating loss carryforwards will be available to offset future taxable income of atlantic power us gp  however  their use may be subject to an annual limitation 
while we expect these losses will be available to us as a future benefit  in the event that they are successfully challenged by the irs or subject to additional future limitations  our ability to realize these benefits may be limited 
a reduction in our net operating losses  or additional limitations on our ability to use such losses  may result in a material increase in our future income tax liability

the lake project filed a claim against pef in which the company sought to confirm its contractual right to sell off peak energy at the contractual price for such sales 
pef filed a counter claim against the lake project  seeking  among other things  the return of amounts paid for off peak power sales during and a declaratory order clarifying lake rights and obligations under the ppa 
the lake project had stopped dispatching during off peak periods pending the outcome of the dispute 
on november   the lake project executed a settlement agreement with pef that resolved the outstanding dispute and dismissed the lawsuit 
the principal terms of the settlement included an agreement by pef to i pay million on or before december  and ii accept delivery and pay for off peak energy at the firm energy rate as defined under the ppa 
the payment was received on december  beginning on november   pef began accepting off peak energy from lake to be paid for at the firm energy rate over the remaining term of the ppa 
in february  we filed a rate application with the ferc to establish path s revenue requirement at million for the period

no accrual has been made for any contingency related to any of the proposed adjustments as of december  on may   our morris facility was struck by lightning 
as a result  steam and electric deliveries were interrupted to our host equistar 
we believe the interruption constitutes a force majeure under the energy services agreement with equistar 
equistar disputes this interpretation and has initiated arbitration proceedings under the agreement for recovery of resulting lost profits and equipment damage among other items 
the agreement with equistar specifically shields morris from exposure to consequential damages incurred by equistar and management expects our insurance to cover any material losses we might incur in connection with such proceedings  including settlement costs 
management will attempt to resolve the arbitration through settlement discussions  but is prepared to vigorously defend the arbitration on the merits

overview of our business atlantic power owns and operates a diverse fleet of power generation and infrastructure assets in the united states and canada 
our power generation projects sell electricity to utilities and other large commercial customers largely under long term ppas  which seek to minimize exposure to changes in commodity prices 
as of december   our power generation projects from continuing operations had an aggregate gross electric generation capacity of approximately  mw in which our aggregate ownership interest is approximately  mw 
these totals exclude projects designated as held for sale at december  on january   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the florida projects 
we expect to enter into a purchase and sale agreement in the remaining part of the first quarter to sell our interest in path our current portfolio consists of interests in twenty nine operational power generation projects across eleven states in the united states and two provinces in canada 
in addition  we have one mw biomass project under construction in georgia 
we also own a majority interest in rollcast  a biomass power plant developer in north carolina and a interest in ridgeline  a wind and solar developer in seattle  washington 
nineteen of our projects are wholly owned subsidiaries 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our interest in the delta person project  acquired a interest in ridgeline  achieved commercial operations at canadian hills and issued debentures in a public offering 
we sell the capacity and energy from our power generation projects under ppas with a number of utilities and other parties 
under the ppas  which have expiration dates ranging from august to  we receive payments for electric energy delivered to our customers known as energy payments  in addition to payments for electric generating capacity known as capacity payments 
we also sell steam from a number of our projects to industrial and commercial purchasers under steam sales agreements 
our power generation projects generally have long term fuel supply agreements  typically accompanied by fuel transportation arrangements 
in most cases  the term of the fuel supply and transportation arrangements corresponds to the term of the relevant ppas 
many of the ppas and steam sales agreements provide for the indexing or pass through of fuel costs to our customers 
in cases where there is not an effective pass through of fuel costs  we often attempt to mitigate the market price risk of changing commodity costs through the use of financial hedging strategies 
we directly operate and maintain of our power generation projects 
we also partner with recognized leaders in the independent power industry to operate and maintain our other projects  including cem  ppms and dps 
under these operation  maintenance and management agreements  the operator is typically responsible for operations  maintenance and repair services 
significant events ridgeline acquisition the ridgeline acquisition  which closed on december   added interests in three wind projects totaling net mw 
the ridgeline acquisition strengthens our ability to execute development 
table of contents stage projects which is one of our target growth areas 
it also complements our other growth area  operating project acquisitions  as exemplified by the partnership transaction completed at the end of ridgeline currently has an active wind and solar development pipeline of more than projects in the united states totaling in excess of mw 
planned development expenditures in are focused on near term opportunities where ppas can be obtained quickly  including solar sites where investment tax credits remain available and construction could be completed as early as the first quarter of wind development viability will depend on continued support from renewable portfolio standards in more than states and continued federal support of production tax credits 
see item a 
risk factors risk related to our business and our projects our renewable energy projects are subject to uncertainties regarding regulatory incentives 
as part of the acquisition  we will integrate ridgeline team of over employees  which has a broad set of competencies essential for the successful identification  resource assessment  development including permitting  construction and operation of large scale renewable power projects 
ridgeline was responsible for developing idaho first utility scale wind project and has successfully developed three additional wind projects totaling mw  including rockland and goshen north 
this team will also assist our assessment and pursuit of other renewable acquisitions and in managing our growing renewable energy portfolio 
commercial operation of canadian hills and project debt pay down the canadian hills project achieved commercial operations on december  in january  we purchased a interest in canadian hills and increased our ownership interest to in march for a nominal sum 
in july  we funded approximately million of our equity contribution net of financing costs 
in december  canadian hills received tax equity investments in aggregate of million from a consortium of four institutional tax equity investors along with an approximately million of our own tax equity investment  which we expect to syndicate with additional tax equity investors in the first half of  although no assurances can be provided regarding our ability to syndicate the investment on acceptable terms or at all  or the timing of any such syndication 
the project outstanding construction loan was repaid from the tax equity proceeds  decreasing the project short term debt by million 
we will oversee the ongoing operation of canadian hills and will act as its asset manager 
common share and convertibles debenture offerings on july   we closed a public offering of  common shares  at a purchase price of per common share and cdn per common share  for aggregate net proceeds from the common share offering  after deducting the underwriting discounts and expenses  of approximately million 
we also issued  in a public offering  million aggregate principal amount of convertible unsecured subordinated debentures due june   the july debentures  after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses  for net proceeds of million 
the july debentures pay interest semi annually on the last day of june and december of each year 
the july debentures are convertible into our common shares at an initial conversion rate of common shares per  principal amount of debentures representing a conversion price of per common share  subject to anti dilution adjustments in certain circumstances 
the july debentures may not be redeemed prior to june  except in limited circumstances 
after june   the july debentures may be redeemed  in whole or in part from time to time  upon certain conditions 
upon a change of control of the company  each holder may require that we purchase the july debentures upon the conditions set forth in the indenture governing the debentures 
we used the net proceeds from the offerings to fund our equity commitment in canadian hills 

table of contents on december   we issued  in a public offering  cdn million aggregate principal amount of convertible unsecured subordinated debentures due december  the december debentures for net proceeds  after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses  of cdn million 
the december debentures pay interest semi annually on the last day of june and december of each year beginning on june  the december debentures are convertible into our common shares at an initial conversion rate of common shares per cdn  principal amount of december debentures representing a conversion price of cdn per common share 
we used the proceeds to acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of ridgeline and to fund certain working capital commitments and acquisition expenses related to ridgeline 
rationalization of project portfolio during  we initiated a strategy to divest non core assets from our project portfolio 
these non core assets include projects that provide immaterial cash distributions  fall outside of our core competency of natural gas  biomass  hydro and renewable power generation  or are less than wholly owned investments where we do not have the ability to make decisions that most directly impact project operations 
in response to this strategy  we sold our interest in badger creek on september  for proceeds of approximately million 
in may  we sold our interest in perh for million  plus a management agreement termination fee of approximately million  for a total sale price of million 
we also entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our interest in the delta person project for approximately million 
the delta person transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of other non core assets that are currently for sale include our approximately interest in gregory  which is being sold together with the interests of the project other partners 
we are also conducting a sales process that began in for our interest in path we expect to enter into a purchase and sale agreement in the remaining part of the first quarter of to sell path the sale would be expected to close in the first half of the project is our only transmission project and it makes a relatively small contribution to overall cash flows 
sale of florida projects on january   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the florida projects for a purchase price  including working capital adjustments  of approximately million 
we expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately million in the aggregate  after repayment of project level debt at auburndale and settlement of all outstanding natural gas swap agreements at lake and auburndale 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale to fully repay our senior credit facility  which is expected to have an outstanding balance of approximately million at close  and for general corporate purposes 
the sale is expected to close in the remaining part of the first quarter of given our projections that the florida energy market will not recover in the near term to allow us to secure economic ppas  we concluded in december  after considering all available options  that the sale of these projects maximizes shareholder value 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of approximately million related to our interest in lake 
factors that may influence our results our primary objective is to generate consistent levels of cash flow to support dividends to our shareholders  which we refer to as cash available for distribution 
because we believe that our shareholders are primarily focused on income and secondarily on capital appreciation  we provide supplementary cash flow based non gaap information in item and discuss our results in terms of 
table of contents these non gaap measures  in addition to analysis of our results on a gaap basis 
see supplementary non gaap financial information below for additional details 
the primary components of our financial results are i the financial performance of our projects  ii non cash unrealized gains and losses associated with derivative instruments and iii interest expense and foreign exchange impacts on corporate level debt 
we have recorded net losses in four of the past five years  primarily as a result of non cash losses associated with items ii and iii above  which are described in more detail in the following paragraphs 
financial performance of our projects the operating performance of our projects supports cash distributions that are made to us after all operating  maintenance  capital expenditures and debt service requirements are satisfied at the project level 
our projects are able to generate cash available for distribution because they generally receive revenues from long term contracts that provide relatively stable cash flows 
risks to the stability of these distributions include the following while approximately of our power generation revenue in was related to contractual capacity payments  commodity prices do influence our variable revenues and the cost of fuel 
our ppas are generally structured to minimize our risk to fluctuations in commodity prices by passing the cost of fuel through to the utility and its customers  but some of our projects do have exposure to market power and fuel prices 
for example  a portion of the natural gas required for projects in our southeast segment is purchased at spot market prices but not effectively passed through in their ppas 
our orlando project should benefit from switching to market prices for natural gas when its fuel contract expires at the end of since the contract prices are above current and projected spot prices 
we have executed a hedging strategy to partially lock in this margin 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and our projects our projects depend on third party suppliers under fuel supply agreements  and increases in fuel costs may adversely affect the profitability of the projects and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional details about our hedging arrangements at our southeast segment projects 
our most significant exposure to market power prices exists at the selkirk  chambers and morris projects 
at chambers  our utility customer has the right to sell a portion of the plant output to the spot power market if it is economical to do so  and the chambers project shares in the profits from those sales 
with low demand for electricity the utility reduces its dispatch to minimum contracted levels during off peak hours 
at selkirk  approximately of the capacity of the facility is currently not contracted and is sold at market power prices or not sold at all if market prices do not support profitable operation of that portion of the facility 
additionally at morris  approximately of the facility capacity is currently not contracted and is sold at market power prices or not sold at all if market prices do not support profitable operation of the facility 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and our projects certain of our projects are exposed to fluctuations in the price of electricity  which may have a material adverse effect on the operating margin of these projects and on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
when revenue or fuel contracts at our projects expire  we may not be able to sell power or procure fuel under new arrangements that provide the same level or stability of project cash flows 
if re contracted  the degree of the expected decline in cash available for distribution is subject to market conditions when we execute new ppas for these projects and is difficult to estimate at this time 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and our projects the expiration or termination of our power purchase agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these projects will be free of debt when their ppas expire  which provides us with some flexibility to 
table of contents pursue the most economic type of contract without restrictions that might be imposed by project level debt 
some of our projects have non recourse project level debt that can restrict the ability of the project to make cash distributions 
the project level debt agreements typically contain cash flow coverage ratio tests that restrict the project cash distributions if project cash flows do not exceed project level debt service requirements by a specified amount 
the delta person and gregory project and epsilon power partners  the holding company for our ownership in the chambers project  are currently not meeting their cash flow coverage ratio tests and they are restricted from making cash distributions 
although we expect to resume receiving distributions from epsilon power partners in and delta person and gregory in  we cannot provide any assurances that these projects will generate enough cash flow to meet the ratio tests and be able to resume distributions to us 
see liquidity and capital resources project level debt and item a 
risk factors risks related to our structure our indebtedness and financing arrangements could negatively impact our business and our projects for additional details 
non cash gains and losses on derivatives instruments in the ordinary course of our business  we execute natural gas swap contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  forward foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on variable rate project level debt 
most of these contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded currently in earnings  resulting in significant volatility in our income that does not significantly affect current period cash flows or the underlying risk management purpose of the derivative instruments 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional details about our derivative instruments 
interest expense and other costs associated with debt interest expense relates to both non recourse project level debt and corporate level debt 
a portion of our convertible debentures and long term corporate level debt are denominated in canadian dollars 
these debt instruments are revalued at each balance sheet date based on the us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date  with changes in the value of the debt recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate has been volatile in recent years  which in turn creates volatility in our results due to the revaluation of our canadian dollar denominated debt 
current trends in our business macroeconomic impacts the recession caused significant decreases in both peak electricity demand and consumption that varied by region 
the recovery from the recession continues on a slow path with a low economic growth rate leading to a slower recovery in employment 
while summer and winter peak demand is also greatly influenced by weather  summer and winter peak demand is projected to steadily increase over the next ten years 
however  such increase in summer and winter peak demand is dependent on the speed of the economic recovery 
as electricity peak demand recovers  base load plants that typically operate at all times and peaking plants those that only operate in periods of very high demand will be impacted more than mid merit plants those that operate for a portion of most days  but not at night or in other lower demand periods 
base load plants may be called on for increased levels of off peak generation and peaking plants may be called on more frequently as a function of their efficiency and the overall peak demand level 
the actual financial impacts on 
table of contents particular plants depend on whether contractual provisions  such as minimum load levels and or significant capacity payments  partially mitigate the impact of reduced demand 
increased renewable power projects the combination of federal stimulus and other tax provisions in the united states and canada  state renewable portfolio standards and state or regional co greenhouse gases reduction programs has provided powerful incentives to build new renewable power capacity 
the american taxpayer relief act  enacted in january extended production tax credits ptc and investment tax credits for projects that start construction prior to january  and extended bonus depreciation for projects that are placed in service prior to january  under present law  the ptc provides an income tax credit of cents kilowatt hour for the production of electricity from utility scale wind turbines 
pursuant to the sta  on september   the omb released an initial report on the potential sequestration triggered by the failure of the joint select committee on deficit reduction to propose  and congress to enact  a plan to reduce the deficit by trillion  as required by the bca 
the sequester is expected to become effective in march if congress does not enact a comprehensive deficit reduction package 
the omb report estimated a reduction of grants in fiscal year see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and our projects our renewable energy projects are subject to uncertainties regarding regulatory incentives 
increased shale gas resources the substantial additions of economically viable shale gas reserves and increasing production levels have put strong downward pressure on natural gas prices in both the spot and forward markets 
one impact of the reduced prices is that gas fired generators have displaced some generation from base load coal plants  particularly in the southeast us lower natural gas prices also have compressed  and in some cases turned negative  the spark spread  which is the industry term for the profit margin between spot market fuel and power prices 
reduced spark spreads directly impact the profitability of plants selling power into the spot market with no contract  which are referred to as merchant plants 
the lower power prices can have an adverse impact on development of new renewable projects whose owners are attempting to negotiate ppas at favorable levels to support the financing and construction of the projects 
the expectation of reduced future volatility of gas prices due to increased supply has reinforced a growing expectation of the role of natural gas as a bridging fuel  helping from a carbon policy perspective to bridge the desired us transition to both cleaner fuels and more commercially viable carbon removal and sequestration technologies 
retirement of fossil fired generation the increase of gas and renewable capacity will be offset by large scale retirements of coal fired generation 
nerc projects gw of fossil fired generation retirement by  with over percent retiring by primarily due to potential and existing federal environmental regulations and low natural gas prices 
credit markets credit markets have strengthened over the past several years and the mix of lenders providing power project financing has changed 
base lending rates such as libor have stayed quite low by historical standards and credit market conditions for project lending have improved to approach pre recession levels 
this expands the number of new power projects that could be feasibly financed and built 
corporate level credit markets have experienced similar improvement and the availability of alternative forms of financing projects such as tax equity investment have enhanced the ability of many development companies to finance new power projects 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that

supplementary non gaap financial information the key measure we use to evaluate the results of our business is cash available for distribution 
cash available for distribution is not a measure recognized under gaap  does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers 
we believe cash available for distribution is a relevant supplemental measure of our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to cash available for distribution is set out below under cash available for distribution 
investors are cautioned that we may calculate this measure in a manner that is different from other companies 
the primary factor influencing cash available for distribution is cash distributions received from the projects 
these distributions received are generally funded from project adjusted ebitda generated by the projects  reduced by project level debt service and capital expenditures  and adjusted for changes in project level working capital and cash reserves 
project adjusted ebitda is defined as project income plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization including non cash impairment charges and changes in fair value of derivative instruments 
project adjusted ebitda is not a measure recognized under gaap and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
we use unaudited project adjusted ebitda to provide comparative information about project performance without considering how projects are capitalized or whether they contain derivative contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value

net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities our cash flow from the projects may vary from year to year based on working capital requirements and the operating performance of the projects  as well as changes in prices under the ppas  fuel supply and transportation agreements  steam sales agreements and other project contracts  changes in regulated transmission rates and the transition to market or re contracted pricing following the expiration of ppas 
project cash flows may have some seasonality and the pattern and frequency of distributions to us from the projects during the year can also vary  although such seasonal variances do not typically have a material impact on our business 
cash flow from operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  over the comparable period in the change from the prior year is primarily attributable to the increases in project adjusted ebitda noted above as well million in transaction expenses related to the partnership acquisition that occurred in cash flow from operating activities decreased by million for the year ended december  over the comparable period in the change from the prior year is primarily attributable to approximately million in transaction expenses related to the partnership acquisition that occurred in and the timing of the five ontario projects in the northeast segment november receivables received in early january of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by an increase of approximately million of earnings and distributions from our equity investment projects 
investing activities cash flow from investing activities includes changes in restricted cash 
restricted cash fluctuates from period to period in part because non recourse project level financing arrangements typically require all operating cash flow from the project to be deposited in restricted accounts and then released at the time that principal payments are made and project level debt service coverage ratios are met 
as a result  the timing of principal payments on project level debt causes significant fluctuations in restricted cash balances  which typically benefits investing cash flow in the second and fourth quarters of the year and decreases investing cash flow in the first and third quarters of the year 
cash flow used in investing activities includes cash used to fund accretive acquisitions in north american markets 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the change is due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions as the partnership was acquired in the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in construction in progress cost related to the piedmont and canadian hills projects 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the change is due to the million cash paid for the partnership acquisition net of cash acquired

a significant portion of the cash received from project distributions is used to pay dividends to our shareholders and interest on our outstanding convertible debentures  senior notes and other corporate level debt 
our liquidity depends in part on our ability to successfully enter into new ppas at facilities where ppas expire or terminate 
ppas in our portfolio have expiration dates ranging from august to when a ppa expires or is terminated  it may be difficult for us to secure a new ppa  if at all  or the price received by the project for power under subsequent arrangements may be reduced significantly  which may reduce the cash received from project distributions

strategy and financial outlook in its annual review of strategy  business prospects  financial position  operating environment and outlook by management and the board of directors  the company focused on its objective of providing shareholders with an attractive total return  with a view to balancing the income and growth components of total return to create long term value 
growth in cash flows is expected to come from a combination of the development and acquisition of new assets and improvements in the performance of its existing portfolio 
the company expects to continue executing on its growth strategy by utilizing its core competencies and building on its proven track record of acquiring both operating plants and late stage development projects  with a focus on projects with long term ppas and limited commodity exposure 
with its recent acquisition of ridgeline  the company now also has a pipeline of proprietary wind and solar development projects 
the mix of growth opportunities  and therefore allocation of the company resources  has shifted towards earlier stage construction and development projects  including some at a greenfield stage 
at the same time  the company remains committed to a disciplined approach to growth  ensuring that new investments are accretive to cash flow  earnings and leverage metrics either immediately in the case of operating plants or in the first full year of operation for construction and development projects 
dividend level as part of this process  management updated the company cash flow projections under a variety of scenarios  factoring in the company cost of capital  financial leverage and near term recontracting prospects 
the assessment also considered recent developments in ontario  including where the company has a project with its contract expiring in the company project is not in the first group for which recontracting discussions are currently underway with the government 
although the process is not transparent and therefore the outcome is uncertain  recent signals are increasingly challenging 
in addition  higher transcanada pipeline tolls have reduced margins at the company ontario facilities 
thus  the company considered it appropriate to adjust expectations for these projects at least until such time as there is enhanced clarity and or more positive signals 
in addition  the updated projections incorporated the impact on distributable cash resulting from the continued reduction of post ppa estimated cash flows at lake and auburndale  and the subsequent announcement of the florida assets sale  the expected sale of the company path transmission line  reduced recontracting expectations for the company selkirk project in new york  and the impact on cash needs of a greater share of the company growth investments relative to the mix of investments in the past requiring cash upfront while cash returns from these investments would lag on average to months 
in light of all these considerations and in order to accomplish the company strategic and financial objectives  the board  together with management  has concluded that it is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders to target a lower and therefore more sustainable payout ratio that balances yield and growth  and is also more consistent with the company outlook for its current and prospective projects under a range of scenarios 
the board believes that a lower payout ratio will better allow the company to fund its organic growth and development as well as growth from acquisitions  to strengthen its competitive positioning for acquisitions and improve access to capital  if and when needed 
the dividend reduction is expected to improve the company operational and financial flexibility and enhance its ability to deliver on its strategic and financial objectives of creating long term shareholder returns through a sustainable cash dividend plus growth from accretive acquisitions  and construction ready and development projects 

table of contents as a result of this review  the board  with management recommendation  has approved a reduction in the anticipated annual dividend level to cdn per share  or cdn per share on a monthly basis 
the new dividend level will commence with the march dividend to shareholders of record on march  shareholders of record as of that date will receive a dividend of cdn per share on april  the february dividend of cdn  declared on february   will be paid on march  to shareholders of record on february  dividends to shareholders are paid at the discretion of our board of directors and our board of directors may decrease the level  or entirely discontinue payment  of dividends at any time

the holders of series shares will be entitled to receive quarterly floating rate cumulative dividends  as and when declared by the board of directors of the subsidiary  at a rate equal to the sum of the then day government of canada treasury bill rate and 

table of contents the series shares  the series shares and the series shares are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us and by the partnership on a subordinated basis as to i the payment of dividends  as and when declared  ii the payment of amounts due on a redemption for cash  and iii the payment of amounts due on the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the subsidiary company 
if  and for so long as  the declaration or payment of dividends on the series shares  the series shares or the series shares is in arrears  the partnership will not make any distributions on its limited partnership units and we will not pay any dividends on our common shares 
the subsidiary company paid aggregate dividends of million on the series shares and the series shares in compared to million in restricted cash the projects with project level debt generally have reserve requirements to support payments for major maintenance costs and project level debt service 
for projects that are consolidated  our share of these amounts is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   restricted cash at the consolidated projects totaled million 
this amount does not include million of restricted cash at our assets held for sale projects as of december  capital and major maintenance expenditures capital expenditures and maintenance expenses for the projects are generally paid at the project level using project cash flows and project reserves 
therefore  the distributions that we receive from the projects are made net of capital expenditures needed at the projects 
the operating projects which we own consist of large capital assets that have established commercial operations 
on going capital expenditures for assets of this nature are generally not significant because most major expenditures relate to planned repairs and maintenance and are expensed when incurred 
we expect to reinvest approximately to million in in our project portfolio in the form of capital expenditures and major maintenance expenses 
as explained above  this investment is generally paid at the project level 
we believe one of the benefits of our diverse fleet is that plant overhauls and other major expenditures do not occur in the same year for each facility 
recognized industry guidelines and original equipment manufacturer recommendations allow us to predict major maintenance events and balance the funds necessary for these expenditures over time 
future capital expenditures and major maintenance expenses may exceed the level in or the projected level in as a result of the timing of more infrequent events such as steam turbine overhauls and or gas turbine and hydroelectric turbine upgrades 
in  several of our projects conducted scheduled outages to complete major maintenance work 
however  overall maintenance and capital expenditures was higher than in due to our acquisition of the partnership project portfolio 
there were no significant capital expenditures at our operating projects during  but maintenance expenses were substantial  including outage related work performed at the auburndale  pasco  chambers  selkirk  kapuskasing  calstock  morris  naval station and north island facilities 
in all cases  maintenance outages occurred at such times that did not adversely impact the facilities availability requirements under their respective ppas 
during  we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures for the construction of our piedmont biomass project which is nearing commercial operation 
because the project did not achieve commercial operations by a specified date  piedmont is collecting liquidated damages from the construction contractor until completion 
these liquidated damages are expected to offset any additional construction costs incurred at the project

critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information be included in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates  and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities  our revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates  and any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining fair values of acquired assets  the useful lives and recoverability of property  plant and equipment and ppas  the recoverability of equity investments  the recoverability of goodwill  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the valuation of shares associated with our ltip and the fair value of derivatives 

table of contents for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  these policies are discussed below 
acquired assets when we acquire a business  a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to identifiable assets  such as property  plant and equipment  ppas or fuel supply agreements 
fair value of these assets is determined primarily using the income approach  which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate 
we amortize tangible and intangible assets with finite lives over their expected useful lives 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
incorrect estimates could result in future impairment charges  and those charges could be material to our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets and equity investments long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  transmission system rights and other intangible assets and liabilities subject to depreciation and amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
we calculate the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes 
we also consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available 
in the absence of such information  we may consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers or employ other valuation techniques 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations 
however  actual results could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material 
investments in and the operating results of or less owned entities not required to be consolidated are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity method of accounting 
we review our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable 
we also review a project for impairment and perform a two step test at the earlier of executing a new ppa or other arrangement or six months prior to the expiration of an existing ppa 
factors such as the business climate  including current energy and market conditions  environmental regulation  the condition of assets  and the ability to secure new ppas are considered when evaluating long lived assets for impairment 
evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary might include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment  the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment  or  where applicable  estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment 
our assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
when we determine that an impairment test is required  the future projected cash flows from the equity investment are the most significant factor in determining whether impairment exists and  if so  the amount of the impairment charges 
we use our best estimates of market prices of power and fuel and our knowledge of the operations of the project and our related contracts when developing these cash flow estimates 
in addition  when determining fair value using discounted cash flows  the discount 
table of contents rate used can have a material impact on the fair value determination 
discount rates are based on our risk of the cash flows in the estimate  including  when applicable  the credit risk of the counterparty that is contractually obligated to purchase electricity or steam from the project 
we generally consider our investments in our equity method investees to be strategic long term investments that comprise a significant portion of our core operating business 
therefore  we complete our assessments with a long term view 
if the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment 
the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows 
actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material 
goodwill at december   we reported goodwill of million  consisting of million resulting from the november  acquisition of the partnership and million that is associated with the step up acquisition of rollcast in march see item exhibits and financial statements schedule note  goodwill  transmission system rights  power purchase agreements and development intangible assets and liabilities  to the consolidated financial statements for the detail of goodwill allocated to the reportable segments 
we apply an accounting standard under which goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairments at least annually  or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is the project level  which is the lowest level below the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
effective january   we adopted a standard that provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
such qualitative factors may include the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
in the absence of sufficient qualitative factors  goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two step process 
if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount  where necessary  goodwill will be impaired at that time 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of november  based on our qualitative assessment of macroeconomic  industry  and market events and circumstances as well as the overall financial performance of the reporting units acquired in the acquisition of the partnership  we determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill attributed to these reporting units was less than its carrying amount 
as such  the annual two step impairment test was deemed not necessary to be performed for these reporting units for the year ended december  we performed step one of the two step impairment test for the rollcast reporting unit 
we determined the fair value of this reporting unit using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to rollcast long term development budget 
the most significant input to the determination of rollcast fair value are the estimated future cash flows from projects currently in development and expected to be placed into service or sold 
we apply a probability weighted percentage to our estimate the probability that a development project reaches commercial operations or will be sold 
this methodology is consistent with prior step one tests of the rollcast reporting unit 
if fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
under the income approach described above  we estimated the fair value of rollcast to exceed its carrying value by approximately million or at december  our 
table of contents estimate of fair value under the income approach described above is affected primarily by assumptions of the ability of rollcast to develop future biomass projects 
if rollcast is unable to complete development of its budgeted projects our goodwill may become impaired  which would result in a non cash charge  not to exceed million 
fair value of derivatives we utilize derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in fuel commodity prices and foreign currency and to balance our exposure to variable interest rates 
we believe that these derivatives are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
we also enter into long term fuel purchase agreements accounted for as derivatives that do not meet the scope exclusion for normal purchase normal sales 
in determining fair value for our derivative assets and liabilities  we generally use the market approach and incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about market risk and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation techniques 
a fair value hierarchy exists for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs level or level and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs level by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
our derivative instruments are classified as level the fair values of our derivative instruments are based upon trades in liquid markets 
valuation model inputs can generally be verified with market data and valuation techniques do not involve significant judgment 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange prices  time value  volatility factors and credit exposure 
the fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate 
we also adjust the fair value of financial assets and liabilities to reflect credit risk  which is calculated based on our credit rating and the credit rating of our counterparties 
certain derivative instruments qualify for a scope exception to fair value accounting  as they are considered normal purchases or normal sales 
the availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that we have the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying physical commodity 
derivatives that are considered to be normal purchases and normal sales are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are recorded as executory contracts 
income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected future taxable income in the united states and in canada and available tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is comprised primarily of provisions against available canadian and us net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million 
long term incentive plan the officers and certain other employees of atlantic power are eligible to participate in the ltip 
unvested notional units are entitled to receive dividends equal to the dividends per common share during the vesting period in the form of additional notional units 
unvested units are subject to forfeiture if the participant is not an employee at the vesting date or  for officers  if we do not meet certain performance targets 

table of contents compensation expense related to awards granted to participants in the ltip is recorded over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date for notional units accounted for as equity awards and the fair value of the award at each balance sheet date for notional units accounted for as liability awards 
the fair value of awards with market vesting conditions is based upon a monte carlo simulation model on their grant date 
unvested notional units are recorded as either a liability or equity award based on management intended method of redeeming the notional units when they vest 
the ltip was amended in april notional shares issued subsequent to the amendment will no longer have performance based vesting conditions 
allocation of net income or losses to investors in certain variable interest entities for consolidated investments that allocate taxable income and losses  tax credits and cash distributions under complex allocation provisions of agreements with third party investors  net income or loss is allocated to third party investors for accounting purposes using the hypothetical liquidation book value hlbv method 
hlbv is a balance sheet oriented approach that calculates the change in the claims of each partner on the net assets of the investment at the beginning and end of each period 
each partner claim is equal to the amount each party would receive or pay if the net assets of the investment were to liquidate at book value and the resulting cash was then distributed to investors in accordance with their respective liquidation preferences 
we report the net income or loss attributable to the third party investors as income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting developments adopted on january   we adopted changes issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb to conform existing guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
these changes both clarify the fasb intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and amend certain principles or requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the clarifying changes relate to the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts  measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity shareholders equity  and disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used for level fair value measurements 
the amendments relate to measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and additional disclosures concerning the valuation processes used and sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs for those items categorized as level  a reporting entity use of a nonfinancial asset in a way that differs from the asset highest and best use  and the categorization by level in the fair value hierarchy for items required to be measured at fair value for disclosure purposes only 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb to the presentation of comprehensive income 
these changes give an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity was eliminated 
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income were not changed 
additionally  no changes were made to the calculation and presentation of earnings per share 
we elected to present the two statement option 
other than the change in presentation  the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued changes to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
these changes provide an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
such qualitative factors may include the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test  otherwise no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  go directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
these changes become effective for any goodwill impairment test performed on january  or later 
we early adopted these changes for our annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of these changes did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued changes to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
these changes require an entity to perform all steps in the test for a reporting unit whose carrying value is zero or negative if it is more likely than not more than that a goodwill impairment exists based on qualitative factors  resulting in the elimination of an entity ability to assert that such a reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and additional testing is not necessary despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate otherwise 
we adopted these changes beginning january  based on the most recent impairment review of our goodwill november   we determined these changes did not impact the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued changes to the disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations 
these changes clarify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
also  the existing supplemental pro forma disclosures were expanded to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
we adopted these changes beginning january  these changes are reflected in note  acquisitions and divestments 
issued in july  the fasb issued changes to the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  similar to the goodwill changes issued in september these changes provide an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
such qualitative factors may include the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test  otherwise no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  proceed directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
these changes become effective for us for any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test performed on january  or later  although early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of these changes to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued changes to conform existing guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
these changes both clarify the fasb intent about the application of existing fair value measurement 
table of contents and disclosure requirements and amend certain principles or requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the clarifying changes relate to the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts  measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity shareholders equity  and disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used for level fair value measurements 
the amendments relate to measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and additional disclosures concerning the valuation processes used and sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs for those items categorized as level  a reporting entity use of a nonfinancial asset in a way that differs from the asset highest and best use  and the categorization by level in the fair value hierarchy for items required to be measured at fair value for disclosure purposes only 
these changes become effective on january  these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued changes to the presentation of comprehensive income 
these changes give an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity was eliminated 
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income were not changed 
additionally  no changes were made to the calculation and presentation of earnings per share 
we will adopt these changes on january  other than the change in presentation  these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that changes in market prices  such as foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices  will affect our cash flows or the value of our holdings of financial instruments 
the objective of market risk management is to minimize the impact that market risks have on our cash flows as described in the following paragraphs 
our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in fuel and electricity commodity prices  currency exchange rates or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in fuel commodity prices  currency exchange rates or interest rates and the timing of transactions 
see note  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities for additional information 
fuel commodity market risk our current and future cash flows are impacted by changes in electricity  natural gas and coal prices 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and our projects our projects depend on third party suppliers under fuel supply agreements  and increases in fuel costs may adversely affect the profitability of the projects 
the combination of long term energy sales and fuel purchase agreements is generally designed to mitigate the impacts to cash flows of changes in commodity prices by passing through changes in fuel prices to the buyer of the energy 
the tunis project is exposed to changes in natural gas prices under spot purchases through the project entered into short term contracts expiring in early to partially mitigate this risk 
the 
table of contents projected annual cash distributions at tunis would change by approximately million per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas based on the current level of natural gas volumes used by the project 
the operating margin at our owned orlando project is exposed to changes in natural gas prices following the expiration of its fuel contract at the end of we have entered into natural gas swaps in order to effectively fix the price of million mmbtu of future natural gas purchases representing approximately of our share of the expected natural gas purchases at the project during and we also entered into natural gas swaps to effectively fix the price of million mmbtu of future natural gas purchases representing approximately of our share of the expected natural gas purchases at the project during and electricity commodity market risk our current and future cash flows are impacted by changes in electricity prices when our projects operate with no ppa or projects that operate with ppas that are based on spot market pricing 
our most significant exposure to market power prices is at the chambers and morris projects 
at chambers  our utility customer has the right to sell a portion of the plant output into the spot power market if it is profitable to do so  and the chambers project shares in the profits from these sales 
in addition  during periods of low spot electricity prices the utility takes less generation  which negatively affects the project operating margin 
in  projected cash distributions at chambers would change by approximately million per change in the spot price of electricity based on a forecasted level of approximately mwh and certain other assumptions 
our equity investment in the chambers project is 
at morris  the facility can sell approximately mw above the off taker demand into the grid at market prices 
if market prices do not justify the increased generation the project has no requirement to sell power in excess of the off taker demand which can negatively impact operating margins 
in  projected cash distributions at morris would change by approximately million per change in the spot price of electricity based on the current level of approximately  mwh grid sales and all other variables being held constant 
we own of the morris project 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and our projects certain of our projects are exposed to fluctuations in the price of electricity  which may have a material adverse effect on the operating margin of these projects and on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
when a ppa expires or is terminated  it is possible that the price received by the project for power under subsequent arrangements may be reduced and in some cases  significantly 
our projects may not be able to secure a new agreement and could be exposed to sell power at spot market prices 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and our projects the expiration or termination of our power purchase agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
it is possible that subsequent ppas or the spot markets may not be available at prices that permit the operation of the project on a profitable basis 
if this occurs  the affected project may temporarily or permanently cease operations 
our current exposure to these future agreements or spot market pricing is at the greeley and gregory projects 
this exposure is not material 
foreign currency exchange risk we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  as many of our projects generate cash flow in us dollars and canadian dollars but we pay dividends to shareholders and interest on corporate level long term debt and convertible debentures predominantly in canadian dollars 
we have a hedging strategy for the purpose of mitigating the currency risk impact on the long term sustainability of dividends to shareholders 
we have executed this strategy utilizing cash flows from our projects that generate canadian dollars and by entering into 
table of contents forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars at a fixed rate to hedge an average of approximately of our expected dividend  long term debt and convertible debenture interest payments through changes in the fair value of the forward contracts partially offset foreign exchange gain or losses on the us dollar equivalent of our canadian dollar obligations 
at december   the forward contracts consist of monthly purchases through the end of of cdn million at an exchange rate of cdn per us dollar and contracts assumed in our acquisition of the partnership with various expiration dates through december to purchase a total of cdn million at an average exchange rate of cdn per us dollar 
it is our intention to periodically consider extending or terminating the length of these forward contracts 
the foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices and the estimation of the counter party credit risk 
changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are recorded in foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
the following table contains the components of recorded foreign exchange gain loss for years ended december    and year ended december  unrealized foreign exchange gain loss convertible debentures and other forward contracts realized foreign exchange loss gains on forward contract settlements the following table illustrates the impact on the fair value of our financial instruments of a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar as of december  convertible debentures denominated in canadian dollars  at carrying value foreign currency forward contracts interest rate risk changes in interest rates do not have a significant impact on cash payments that are required on our debt instruments as approximately of our debt  including our share of the project level debt associated with equity investments in affiliates  either bears interest at fixed rates or is financially hedged through the use of interest rate swaps 
after considering the impact of interest rate swaps described below  a hypothetical change in the average interest rate of basis points would change annual interest costs  including interest at equity investments  by approximately million 
cadillac we have an interest rate swap at our consolidated cadillac project to economically fix its exposure to changes in interest rates related to the variable rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge of the forecasted interest payments under the project level cadillac debt and changes in their fair market value are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the interest rate swap expires on september  
table of contents in accounting for the cash flow hedge  gains and losses on the derivative contract are reported in other comprehensive income loss  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income loss 
that is  for cash flow hedge  all effective components of the derivative contract gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
other comprehensive income loss consists of those financial items that are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income loss 
thus  in highly effective cash flow hedges  where there is no ineffectiveness  other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on net income loss until the expected transaction occurs 
piedmont we executed two interest rate swaps at our consolidated piedmont project to economically fix its exposure to changes in interest rates related to its variable rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreements are not designated as hedges and changes in their fair market value are recorded in the statements of operations 
the interest rate swaps expire on february  and november   respectively 
epsilon power partners epsilon power partners  a wholly owned subsidiary  has an interest rate swap to economically fix the exposure to changes in interest rates related to the variable rate non recourse debt 
the interest rate swap agreement effectively converted the floating rate debt to a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of july the notional amount of the swap matches the outstanding principal balance over the remaining life of epsilon power partners debt 
this interest rate swap agreement is not designated as a hedge and changes in its fair market value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
meadow creek meadow creek executed interest rate swaps that we assumed in our acquisition to economically fix the exposure to changes in interest rates related to of the outstanding the variable rate non recourse debt 
these swaps effectively modify the project exposure by converting the project floating rate debt to a fixed basis 
the interest rate swaps are with various counterparties and swap the expected interest payments from floating libor to fixed rates structured in two tranches 
the first tranche is for the notional amount due of the term loan commencing on december  and ending december  and fixes the interest rate at 
the second tranche is the post term portion of the loan  or the balloon payment and commences on december  and ends on december  fixing the interest rate at
