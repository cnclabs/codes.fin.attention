item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
business overview we design  develop and market analog and mixed signal integrated circuits ics and other electronic components and circuitry used in high voltage power conversion 
our products are used in power converters that convert electricity from a high voltage source typically volts or higher to the type of power required for a specified downstream use 
in most cases  this conversion entails  among other functions  converting alternating current ac to direct current dc or vice versa  reducing or increasing the voltage  and regulating the output voltage and or current according to the customer specifications 
a large percentage of our products are ics used in ac dc power supplies  which convert the high voltage ac from a wall outlet to the low voltage dc required by most electronic devices 
power supplies incorporating our products are used with all manner of electronic products including mobile phones  computers  entertainment and networking equipment  appliances  electronic utility meters  industrial controls and led lights 
since our may acquisition of ct concept technologie ag concept  we also offer igbt drivers circuit boards containing multiple ics  electrical isolation components and other circuitry used to operate arrays of high voltage  high power transistors known as igbt modules 
these driver module combinations are used for power conversion in high power applications ie  power levels ranging from tens of kilowatts up to one gigawatt such as industrial motors  solar and wind power systems  electric vehicles and high voltage dc transmission systems 
our products bring a number of important benefits to the power conversion market compared with less advanced alternatives  including reduced component count and design complexity  smaller size  higher reliability and reduced time to market 
our products also improve the energy efficiency of power converters  helping our customers meet the increasingly stringent efficiency standards that have been adopted around the world for many electronic products  and improving the efficacy of renewable energy systems  electric vehicles and other high power applications 
while the size of the power supply market fluctuates with changes in macroeconomic conditions  the market has generally exhibited a modest growth rate over time as growth in the unit volumes of power supplies has largely been offset by reductions in the average selling price of components in this market 
therefore  the growth of our business depends primarily on our penetration of the power supply market  and our success in expanding the addressable market by introducing new products that address a wider range of applications 
our growth strategy includes the following elements increase the penetration of our ics in the low power ac dc power supply market 
the largest proportion of our revenues comes from power supply applications requiring watts of output or less 
we continue to introduce more advanced products that make our ic based solutions more attractive in this market 
we have also increased the size of our sales and field engineering staff considerably in recent years  and we continue to expand our offerings of technical documentation and design support tools and services in order to help customers use our ics 
these tools and services include our pi expert design software  which we offer free of charge  and our transformer sample service 
increase the penetration of our products in higher power applications 
we believe we have developed and acquired technologies and products that enable us to bring the benefits of integration to applications requiring more than watts of output 
these include such applications as main power supplies for flat panel tvs  desktop pcs  game consoles and  by virtue of our acquisition of concept  igbt driver applications such as industrial motors  renewable energy systems and electric vehicles 

table of contents capitalize on the growing demand for more energy efficient electronic products and lighting technologies  and for cleaner energy and transportation technologies 
we believe that energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important design criterion for power supplies due largely to the emergence of standards and specifications that encourage  and in some cases mandate  the design of more energy efficient electronic products 
power supplies incorporating our ics are generally able to comply with all known efficiency specifications currently in effect 
additionally  technological advances combined with regulatory and legislative actions are resulting in the adoption of alternative lighting technologies such as light emitting diodes  or leds 
we believe this presents a significant opportunity for us because our ics are used in power supply  or driver  circuitry for high voltage led lighting applications 
finally  the growing desire for less carbon intensive sources of energy and modes of transportation represents an opportunity for us since our concept igbt driver products are used in renewable energy systems and electronic trains and automobiles 
our net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues from to was driven by the inclusion of million of revenues from concept  which we acquired in may the increase was partially offset by lower sales of our products into the communications end market  reflecting lower demand from certain end customers in the cellphone market  and lower sales into the computer and consumer end markets  largely as a result of weaker demand generally observed across the broader semiconductor industry 
the slight decline in revenues from to reflected general industry conditions  specifically a slowdown in industry wide demand in the second half of the year 
revenues from the consumer end market  our largest end market in terms of revenues  were down slightly compared with the prior year  while revenues from the communications end market  our second largest end market  were down by a high single digit percentage from the prior year 
these declines were largely offset by higher sales into the industrial and computer end markets 
our top ten customers  including distributors that resell to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers  accounted for  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
our top two customers  both distributors of our products  collectively accounted for approximately for both and  and of our net revenues in in  international sales comprised of net revenues  and in and  international sales comprised and of our net revenues  respectively 
because our industry is intensely price sensitive  our gross margin gross profit divided by net revenues is subject to change based on the relative pricing of solutions that compete with ours 
variations in product mix  end market mix and customer mix can also cause our gross margin to fluctuate 
also  because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon wafers from foundries located in japan  our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
all else being equal  a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen would eventually result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately to  this sensitivity may increase or decrease depending on the percentage of our wafer supply that we purchase from some of our japanese suppliers 
also  although our wafer fabrication and assembly operations are outsourced  as are most of our test operations  a portion of our production costs are fixed in nature 
as such  our unit costs and gross profit margin are impacted by the volume of units we produce 
our gross profit  defined as net revenues less cost of revenues  was million  or of net revenues  in  compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in gross margin  the percentage of revenues represented by gross profit  from to was due primarily to lower manufacturing costs  including more favorable wafer pricing from contracted foundries  our migration to a lower cost process technology for many of our products  and the completion of our conversion from five to six inch wafers  the increase was also driven by a more favorable end market mix 
these factors were partially offset by higher period costs resulting from the amortization of intangibles and inventory write up related to our acquisition of concept refer to note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  for details 
the decrease in our gross margin in compared to was due primarily to higher input costs as well as a less favorable product mix  the increase in input costs was driven primarily by increased depreciation expense for machinery and equipment which will allow us to increase our production capacity  the decline in the value of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  which had increased the cost of silicon wafers purchased from some of our japanese wafer fabrication foundries and the rise in the prices of some materials  primarily gold and copper  used in the assembly of our products 

table of contents total operating expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses from to was driven primarily by our semisouth impairment charges 
in we incurred impairment charges comprising the write off of million for a prepaid royalty and million related to a payment under a loan guarantee for semisouth refer to note  transactions with third party  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on the impairment 
the increase in operating expenses was also driven by higher payroll and related expenses including stock based compensation expenses due to increased headcount attributable to our acquisition of concept  and increased amortization of intangible assets  including the concept tradename and customer relationships refer to note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  for details 
the increase in operating expenses from to was driven primarily by increased payroll and related expenses due to increased headcount  including higher research and development headcount resulting from an acquisition we completed in the third quarter of for details see note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  increases in sales and marketing headcount as a result of growth in our sales force and increased product development and materials expenses related to foundry qualifications and ongoing new product development 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those listed below 
we base our estimates on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  stock based compensation  estimating write downs for excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes business combinations  and goodwill and intangible assets 
our critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a brief description of these critical accounting policies is set forth below 
for more information regarding our accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenues consist of sales to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  merchant power supply manufacturers and distributors 
approximately of our net product sales were made to distributors in we apply the provisions of accounting standard codification asc asc and all related appropriate guidance 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to our customer 
we evaluate whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
with respect to collectability  we perform credit checks for new customers and perform ongoing evaluations of our existing customers financial condition and requires letters of credit whenever deemed necessary 
sales to international oems and merchant power supply manufacturers for shipments from our facility outside of the united states are pursuant to ex works  or exw  shipping terms  meaning that title to the product transfers to the customer upon shipment from our foreign warehouse 
sales to international oem customers and merchant power supply manufacturers that are shipped from our facility in california are pursuant to delivered at frontier  or daf  shipping terms 
as such  title to 
table of contents the product passes to the customer when the shipment reaches the destination country and revenue is recognized upon the arrival of the product in that country 
shipments to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers in the americas are pursuant to free on board  or fob  point of origin shipping terms meaning that title is passed to the customer upon shipment 
revenue is recognized upon title transfer for sales to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
sales to most distributors are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and rights of return on our products held by the distributors 
as a result of these rights  we defer the recognition of revenue and the costs of revenues derived from sales to these distributors until our distributors report that they have sold our products to their customers 
our recognition of such distributor sell through is based on point of sales reports received from the distributor  at which time the price is no longer subject to adjustment and is fixed  and the products are no longer subject to return to us except pursuant to warranty terms 
the gross profit that is deferred upon shipment to the distributor is reflected as deferred income on sales to distributors in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the total deferred revenue as of december   and december   was approximately million and million  respectively 
the total deferred cost as of december   and december   was approximately million and million  respectively 
frequently  distributors need to sell at a price lower than the standard distribution price in order to win business 
at the time the distributor invoices its customer or soon thereafter  the distributor submits a ship and debit price adjustment claim to us to adjust the distributor cost from the standard price to the pre approved lower price 
after we verify that the claim was pre approved  a credit memo is issued to the distributor for the ship and debit claim 
we maintain a reserve for these unprocessed claims and for estimated future ship and debit price adjustments 
the reserve appears as a reduction to accounts receivable in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent future ship and debit claims significantly exceed amounts estimated  there could be a material impact on the deferred revenue and deferred margin ultimately recognized 
to evaluate the adequacy of our reserves  we analyze historical ship and debit payments and levels of inventory in the distributor channels 
sales to certain of our distributors are made under terms that do not include rights of return or price concessions after the product is shipped to the distributor 
accordingly  product revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
stock based compensation we apply the provisions of asc  share based payment 
under the provisions of asc  we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation in our financial statements over the requisite service period of the individual grants  which generally equals a four year vesting period 
we use estimates of volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate  dividend yield and forfeitures in determining the fair value of these awards and the amount of compensation expense to recognize 
changes in these estimates could result in changes to our compensation charges 
estimating write downs for excess and obsolete inventory when evaluating the adequacy of our valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory  we identify excess and obsolete products and also analyze historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends and historical write offs 
this write down is reflected as a reduction to inventory in the consolidated balance sheets and an increase in cost of revenues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  we may be required to take additional write downs  which could adversely impact our cost of revenues and operating results 
income taxes income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carry forwards that are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc under the provisions of asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  utilizing the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets to the amount that we estimate will more likely than not be realized based on available evidence and management s 
table of contents judgment 
we limit the deferred tax assets recognized related to some of our officers compensation to amounts that we estimate will be deductible in future periods based upon internal revenue code section m 
in the event that we determine  based on available evidence and management judgment  that all or part of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future  we would record a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
as of december   we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our california deferred tax assets as we believe that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
we also maintain a valuation allowance with respect to some of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to tax credits in canada and federal capital losses 
we engage in qualifying activities for r d credit purposes 
the american tax relief act of was signed into law on january  per asc guidance  the federal r d tax credit will be a discrete event in the first quarter of as such  we did not take any benefit relating to federal r d credit in the provision 
although we file us federal  us state  and foreign tax returns  our major tax jurisdiction is the us in the quarter ended march   the irs began an audit of fiscal years through  and the audit is currently in process 
business combinations the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
to the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  such excess is allocated to goodwill 
we determine the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information  including discounted cash flows  quoted market prices and estimates made by management 
we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation  as necessary  during the measurement period of up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information as to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date impacting asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or as other indicators of impairment emerge 
the provisions of asc require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the implied fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment adjustment is required 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value  step two will be completed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any exists 
if the carrying value of our single reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference  but not in excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill 
under the amendments of asc  asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  beginning in the first quarter of we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  we elect this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
we have not elected this option to date 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarters of and  and concluded that no impairment existed as of december   and december  asc also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  such as acquired intangibles and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  we recognize an impairment charge by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset

net revenues consist of revenues from product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances 
the increase in revenues from to was driven by the inclusion of million of revenues from concept  which we acquired in may the increase was partially offset by lower sales of our products into the communications end market  reflecting lower demand from certain end customers in the cellphone market  and lower sales into the computer and consumer end markets  largely as a result of weaker demand generally observed across the broader semiconductor industry 
the slight decline in revenues from to reflected general industry conditions  specifically a slowdown in industry wide demand in the second half of the year 
revenues from the consumer end market  our largest end market in terms of revenues  were down slightly compared with the prior year  while revenues from the communications end market  our second largest end market  were down by a high single digit percentage from the prior year 
these declines were largely offset by higher sales into the industrial market  due primarily to our concept acquisition  and the computer end market 
our net revenue mix by the end markets served in  and were as follows year ended december  end market consumer communications industrial electronics computer 
table of contents sales to customers outside of the americas were million in  compared to million in and million in  representing approximately of net revenues in  in and of net revenues in although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured by our customers in asia 
as a result  sales to this region were approximately of our net revenues in and of net revenues in and we expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues 
distributors accounted for  and of our net product sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  with direct sales to oems and power supply manufacturers accounting for the remainder in each of the corresponding years 
in  and  two distributors  avnet and atm electronic corporation  each accounted for more than of revenues 
the table below includes net revenues from each of these customers for the three years ended december  year ended december  customer avnet atm electronic corporation no other customers accounted for or more of net revenues during these years 
gross profit 
gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of wafers from our contracted foundries  the assembly  packaging and testing of our products by sub contractors  product testing performed in our own facility  overhead associated with the management of our supply chain and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
gross margin is gross profit divided by net revenues 
the table below compares gross profit and gross margin for the years ended december   and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues gross profit gross margin the increase in gross margin from to was due primarily to lower manufacturing costs  including more favorable wafer pricing from contracted foundries  our migration to a lower cost process technology for many of our products  and the completion of our conversion from five to six inch wafers  the increase was also driven by a more favorable end market mix  primarily the industrial end market which includes concept sales 
these factors were partially offset by higher period costs resulting from the amortization of intangibles and inventory write up related to our acquisition of concept refer to note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  for details 
the decrease in our gross margin in compared to was due primarily to higher input costs as well as a less favorable product mix  the increase in input costs was driven primarily by increased depreciation expense for machinery and equipment to expand our production capacity  the decline in the value of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  which had increased the cost of silicon wafers purchased from some of our japanese wafer fabrication foundries and the rise in the prices of some materials  primarily gold and copper  used in the assembly of our products 
research and development expenses 
research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including stock based compensation and expensed material and facility costs associated with the development of new processes and new products 
we also record r d expenses for prototype wafers related to new products until the products are released to production 
the table below compares r d expenses for the years ended december   and dollars in millions 
table of contents year ended december  net revenues r d expenses r d expenses as a of net revenues r d expenses increased in compared to driven primarily by increased payroll and related expenses  resulting from increased headcount due primarily to our acquisition of concept  and increased stock based compensation expense due to annual rsu awards granted to employees in addition to rsus granted to concept employees 
in addition  r d expenses for include accrued stock based compensation expenses related to psus that are expected to vest  whereas no psu stock based compensation expense was recognized in the increase also reflects increased product development expenses related to foundry qualifications and ongoing new product development 
r d expenses increased in compared to primarily due to an acquisition completed in august of which increased headcount and payroll related expenses 
this acquisition also resulted in increased depreciation and facilities expenses see note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  for details 
product development and materials expenses also increased year over year due to expenses related to foundry qualifications and ongoing new product development 
these increases were partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including stock based compensation  commissions to sales representatives  amortization of intangible assets and facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
the table below compares sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december   and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses as a of net revenue sales and marketing expenses increased in  compared to  due primarily to the acquisition of concept  which resulted in increased expenses related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  as well as increased headcount  which resulted in higher payroll and related expenses  including stock based compensation expense

the table below compares the provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and dollars in millions year ended december  income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was negative as a result of the irs audit agreement described in note  provision for income taxes  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the audit agreement includes federal and state taxes plus interest charges totaling approximately million  partially offset by the reversal of related unrecognized tax benefits of million  for a net charge of million 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge and write off of certain assets related to semisouth of approximately million on which we recognized a million tax benefit 
the write off resulted in a net loss for the year 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of for the year ended december   due primarily to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings as well as a federal research tax credit partially offset by a valuation allowance on our california deferred tax asset

the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital resulted primarily from the acquisition of concept refer to note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  for details  which we acquired for cash of approximately million  the payment of million in conjunction with the irs audit agreement  and our loan to semisouth which we determined was uncollectable 
in march  we loaned semisouth million  and in exchange we were issued a promissory note 
in october  we determined the loan to semisouth was other than temporarily impaired as of september   and as a result the loan was written off 
the charge was reflected in the consolidated statements of income loss under the other income expense  charge related to semisouth caption for year ended december  see note  transactions with third party  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on the semisouth loan 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with two banks 
the credit agreement provides us with a million revolving line of credit to use for general corporate purposes with a million sublimit for the issuance of standby and trade letters of credit 
our ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon our compliance with specified covenants  including reporting and financial covenants  primarily a minimum cash requirement and a debt to earnings ratio  with which we are currently in compliance 
the credit agreement terminates on july   all advances under the revolving line of credit will become due on such date  or earlier in the event of a default

as of december   we had a contractual obligation related to income tax  consisting primarily of unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million 
the tax obligation was classified as long term income taxes payable and a portion is recorded in deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the settlement period for our income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  they are not expected to be due within the next year 
in the first quarter of  the irs informed us that it intended to propose material adjustments to our taxable income for fiscal years through related to our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement and related issues 
in december  we received an addendum to the notice of proposed adjustments from the irs related to our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement 
in the quarter ended june   we reached an agreement with the irs to settle all positions and close out the examination of our income tax returns for the years through under the agreement  in the third quarter of  we made a one time payment of taxes and interest totaling approximately million 
though we believe the irs position with respect to the adjustments is inconsistent with applicable tax law  and that we had a meritorious defense to our position  we elected to accept a negotiated agreement that we believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders 
the agreement addresses the royalty issue related to our international tax structure for all tax years after including the years  which are currently being audited by the irs 
further  the agreement confirms that the royalty arrangement between power integrations  inc and our foreign subsidiary concluded on october   resulting in a substantially lower effective tax rate for us in future periods 
also  the agreement will allow us to repatriate up to million from our foreign based subsidiary in future periods without incurring us income taxes 
our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may change in future periods due to changes in our planned cash outlays  including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions  and the results of our irs audit 
we expect continued sales growth in our foreign business and plans to use the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries to continue to fund both the working capital and growth needs of our foreign entities  along with providing funding for any future foreign acquisitions 
current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations since a significant amount of our cash and investments are held in the us in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if us tax has not already been previously provided  we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in connection with the repatriation of any funds 
if our operating results deteriorate in future periods  either as a result of a decrease in customer demand  or severe pricing pressures from our customers or our competitors  or for other reasons  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
in that case  we may be forced to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  use our current financing or seek additional financing from third parties to fund our operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with existing sources of liquidity  will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we consider cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short term investments 
in the first quarter of  we changed our investment policy to allow the sale of long term and short term investments prior to their stated maturity date 
we generally hold securities until maturity  however  they may now be sold under certain circumstances  including  but not limited to  when necessary for the funding of acquisitions and other strategic investments 
as a result of this change in policy we classify our investment portfolio as available for sale as opposed to held to maturity 
we invest in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to facilitate portfolio liquidity 
at december   we held primarily cash equivalents and short term investments with fixed interest rates 
at december   we held primarily cash equivalents and short term and long term investments with fixed interest rates 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
our investment securities are subject to market interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
to minimize market risk  most of our investments subject to market risk mature in less than one year  and therefore if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by from interest rates as of december   or december   the increase or decrease in the fair market value of our portfolio on these dates would not have been material 
we monitor our investments for impairment on a periodic basis

foreign currency exchange risk 
as of december   our primary transactional currency was the us dollar  in addition  we hold cash in swiss francs and euro as a result of our acquisition of concept 
we completed the acquisition of concept  which is located in biel  switzerland  in the second quarter of included in the assets acquired was cash denominated in swiss francs and the euro  which will be used to fund concept operations 
cash balances held in foreign countries are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the united states 
the following represents the potential impact on our income  before provision for income tax  of a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the swiss franc and euro as of december  this sensitivity analysis applies a change in the us dollar value of and 
december  swiss franc and euro foreign exchange impact in thousands of usd 
table of contents the foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the us dollar versus the swiss franc and euro is recorded in other income in our consolidated statements of income loss 
we have sales offices in various other foreign countries in which our expenses are denominated in the local currency  primary asia and western europe 
from time to time we may enter into foreign currency hedging contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions 
as of december  and december   we did not have an open foreign currency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
with two of our major suppliers  seiko epson corporation  or epson  and rohm lapis semiconductor co  ltd  or lapis  we have wafer supply agreements based in us dollars  however  our agreements with epson and lapis also allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
each year  our management and these suppliers review and negotiate pricing  the negotiated pricing is denominated in us dollars but is subject to contractual exchange rate provisions 
the fluctuation in the exchange rate is shared equally between power integrations and each of these suppliers 
nevertheless  as a result of our above mentioned supplier agreements  our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
all else being equal  a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen would result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately to  this sensitivity may increase or decrease depending on the percentage of our wafer supply that we purchase from some of our japanese suppliers and could subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations
