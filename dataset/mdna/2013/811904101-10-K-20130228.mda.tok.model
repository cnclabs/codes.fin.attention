offshore marine services the market for offshore oil and gas drilling has historically been cyclical 
demand tends to be linked to the price of oil and gas and those prices tend to fluctuate based on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of reserves 
price levels for oil and gas can in themselves influence demand 
in addition to the price of oil and gas  the availability of acreage  local tax incentives or disincentives  and requirements for maintaining interests in leases affect activity in the oil and gas industry 
the cyclicality of the market is further exacerbated by the tendency in the industry to order capital assets as demand grows  often resulting in new capacity becoming available just as demand for oil and gas is peaking and activity is about to decline 
offshore market conditions improved during  primarily due to increased demand derived from offshore drilling and exploration activities 
although vessel utilization and average day rates improved in all geographic regions  they continue to be lower than levels 
margins are further pressured by escalating operating costs  in particular the market for qualified and experienced crew has become more competitive resulting in higher wage rates 
operators are struggling to man reactivated vessels and to meet customer requirements for higher qualified personnel 
the company expects to see a continuation of the upward trends in activity levels and wage pressures during in international markets  the delivery of newly built vessels during has created a situation of oversupply in the north sea  asia  middle east and west africa regions  which is expected to continue during over the last several years  offshore marine services has disposed of its old generation equipment while taking delivery of new vessels specifically designed to meet the changing requirements of the market 
since december   the average age of the fleet  excluding standby safety and wind farm utility vessels  has been reduced from years to years as of december  offshore marine services enters with an increased order book for new equipment and believes its diverse fleet and broad geographical distribution of vessels will assist in capitalizing on opportunities created by increased activity levels 
the company strong financial position should enable offshore marine services to purchase  mobilize or upgrade vessels to meet changing market conditions 
as of december   in addition to its existing fleet  offshore marine services had new construction projects in progress including two foreign flag  dp catamarans scheduled for delivery in the first and second quarters of  six us flag  dp fsvs scheduled for delivery between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of  four us flag  dp supply vessels scheduled for delivery between the third quarter of and first quarter of  and four foreign flag wind farm utility vessels scheduled for delivery throughout 
table of contents the number and type of vessels operated  their rates per day worked and their utilization levels are the key determinants of offshore marine services operating results and cash flows 
unless a vessel is cold stacked removed from operational service  there is little reduction in daily running costs and  consequently  operating margins are most sensitive to changes in rates per day worked and utilization 
the aggregate cost of offshore marine services operations depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
offshore marine services operating costs and expenses are grouped into the following categories personnel primarily wages  benefits  payroll taxes  savings plans and travel for marine personnel  repairs and maintenance primarily routine repairs and maintenance and main engine overhauls which are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs  drydocking primarily the cost of regulatory drydockings performed in accordance with applicable regulations  insurance and loss reserves primarily the cost of hull and machinery and protection and indemnity insurance premiums and loss deductibles  fuel  lubes and supplies  leased in equipment includes the cost of leasing vessels from lessors under bareboat charter arrangements and leasing equipment employed on vessels  brokered vessel activity the cost of chartering in third party vessels under time charter arrangements to fulfill a customer requirement that cannot be filled by a vessel in the company fleet  and other communication costs  expenses incurred in mobilizing vessels between geographic regions  third party ship management fees  freight expenses  customs and importation duties  and other 
the company expenses drydocking  engine overhaul and vessel mobilization costs as incurred 
if a disproportionate number of drydockings  overhauls or mobilizations are undertaken in a particular fiscal year or quarter  operating expenses may vary significantly when compared with the prior year or prior quarter

commencing with the three months ending march   the company will report the historical financial position  results of operations and cash flows of era group as discontinued operations 
a significant portion of aviation services operations involve transportation services provided to offshore oil and gas customers 
the offshore oil and gas market is highly cyclical with demand linked to the price of oil and gas  which tends to fluctuate depending on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of inventory 
in addition to the price of oil and gas  the availability of acreage and local tax incentives or disincentives and requirements for maintaining interests in leases affect activity levels in the oil and gas industry 
price levels for oil and gas by themselves can cause additional fluctuations by inducing changes in consumer behavior 
during the year ended december   the market for aviation services assets in the us gulf of mexico was disrupted by events related to the sinking of the deepwater horizon drilling rig 
after the deepwater horizon incident  the us department of interior imposed a moratorium on offshore deepwater drilling operations  which caused a dramatic decrease in demand for helicopters supporting oil and gas activities in the region 
although the moratorium has been lifted  the process of issuing permits to drill remains slow  which continues to have a negative impact on demand for helicopter services in the us gulf of mexico 
for the last six years  aviation services provided transportation services to government inspectors of offshore installations  drilling rigs and platforms 
as of december   aviation services helicopters were operating under this contract with customer options to increase the number up to helicopters 
brazil is among the most important markets for offshore oil and gas activity world wide 
aviation services committed to participate in the brazilian market by acquiring an ownership interest in aeroleo  a brazilian helicopter operator  in july aviation services contract leases a number of helicopters to aeroleo but deferred recognition of the revenues as a result of difficulties experienced by aeroleo following the cancellation or suspension of certain contracts for a number of helicopters chartered by aeroleo to petrobras brazil 
beginning in  aviation services had begun to deploy helicopters in international markets  frequently under contract lease arrangements to third parties 
the majority of these helicopters support oil and gas activities in regions of rapidly expanding activity  such as brazil  india and indonesia 
aviation services has equipment working in the north sea  mexico and spain 
as of december   aviation services had helicopters located in foreign jurisdictions compared with helicopters as of december  in many cases the helicopters are contracted to local helicopter operators  which often prefer to lease helicopters rather than purchase them 
contract leasing affords aviation services the opportunity to access new markets without significant initial infrastructure investment and generally without ongoing operating risk 
consistent with its diversification strategy  aviation services deploys a number of helicopters in support of other industries and activities  including air medical services and search and rescue services in the u 
s gulf of mexico  which are developed on a subscription basis 
alaska is also an important market for aviation services 
in addition to supporting oil company activities in the cook inlet and along the north slope  aviation services operates a fixed base operation fbo at ted stevens anchorage international airport  provides flightseeing tours and supports firefighting and mining operations 
the aggregate cost of aviation services operations depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
aviation services operating costs and expenses are grouped into the following categories personnel includes wages  benefits  payroll taxes  savings plans  subsistence and travel  repairs and maintenance primarily routine activities as well as helicopter refurbishments and engine and major component overhauls that are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs  insurance the cost of hull and liability insurance premiums and loss deductibles  fuel  leased in equipment includes the cost of leasing helicopters and equipment  and other primarily base expenses  property  sales and use taxes  communication costs  freight expenses  and other 

table of contents aviation services engages a number of third party vendors to maintain the engines and certain components on some of its helicopter models under programs known as power by hour maintenance contracts 
these programs require aviation services to pay for the maintenance service ratably over the contract period  typically based on actual flight hours 
power by hour providers generally bill monthly based on hours flown in the prior month  the costs being expensed as incurred 
in the event aviation services places a helicopter in a program after a maintenance period had begun  it may be necessary to pay an initial buy in charge based on hours flown since the previous maintenance event 
this buy in charge is normally recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized as an operating expense over the remaining power by hour contract period 
if a helicopter is sold or otherwise removed from a program before the scheduled maintenance work is carried out  aviation services may be able to recover part of the company payments to the power by hour provider  in which case a reduction to operating expense is recorded when the refund is received 
aviation services also incurs repairs and maintenance expense through vendor arrangements whereby it obtains quotes and authorizes service through a repair order process 
aviation services expenses all repair costs as incurred  which may result in operating expenses varying substantially when compared with a prior year or prior quarter if a disproportionate number of refurbishments or overhauls are undertaken 
this variation may be exacerbated by the timing of entering or exiting third party power by hour programs 
helicopters are contract leased to third parties under arrangements whereby the customer assumes operational responsibility  aviation services often provides maintenance and parts support but generally does not incur any other material operating costs 
in most instances  contract leases require clients to procure adequate insurance but aviation services purchases contingent hull and liability coverage to mitigate the risk of a client coverage failing to respond 
in some instances  aviation services provides crews and other services to support its contract lease customers

in addition  repairs and maintenance expenses decreased by million due to a reduction in hours flown for aviation services ec heavy helicopters 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase as additional helicopters were placed in power by hour programs and a million increase in other repairs and maintenance costs primarily due to the timing of repairs on helicopters not covered by power by hour arrangements 
insurance and loss reserves were million higher due to an increase in the overall fleet value and the recognition of a good experience credit from our hull and liability underwriters in the year ended december  fuel costs were million higher primarily due to increased flight hours in the us gulf of mexico  in line with the increased activity discussed above

inland river services historically  activity levels for grain exports and non grain imports are the key drivers in determining freight rates 
in  the persistent and prolonged drought conditions had a negative impact on domestic corn production and grain export demand 
the year had begun on an optimistic note with tight domestic feed grain stocks encouraging farmers to plant record corn acreage in however the drought decimated corn yields and the continuing tight domestic feed grain and oilseed stocks caused river export volumes to be lower in compared with and lower than the prior three year average 
in the fourth quarter of  corn export volumes through the port of new orleans were the lowest in recent history at just over three million metric tons 
the drought also had a negative impact on barge and boat operations 
river stages dropped to levels not seen in over years leading to tow size restrictions  draft restrictions  periodic river closures and harbor delays on the lower mississippi river 
conversely  the market for liquid barge transportation remained very active in  driven by high refinery utilization and an increased demand for domestic crude oil  chemical and industrial movements 
approximately twenty five percent of the us  barrel liquid tank barge fleet was employed in the movement of domestic crude oil to refining complexes 
this also supported demand for the remaining fleet for the movement of clean oil feedstock  blending components and finished products 
the water borne market was further strengthened by the fact that alternatives such as domestic pipelines and rail were operated at high capacity levels throughout the year 
on december   the company acquired a controlling interest in naviera central sa naviera  which is a provider of inland river barge and terminal services on the magdalena river in colombia 
on december   the company acquired certain terminal and fleeting assets and certain related affiliates from lewis clark marine  inc lewis clark 
during  the terminal operation in the st 
louis area experienced high volumes of deliveries for grain  grain by products  and other agricultural and industrial products 
this was primarily due to competitive pricing offered by the major rail carriers serving st 
louis compared with the pacific northwest and the center gulf region new orleans houston of the united states 
in addition  dry cargo barge freight rates were competitive primarily due to the soft market conditions caused by the drought 
these factors combined to make st 
louis a competitive delivery point for lewis clark customers 
the lewis clark fleeting operation also benefited from the high barge traffic to terminals in the st 
louis harbor and higher refining activity in barge activity through the st 
louis region has been growing significantly in recent years 
the region competitive transportation advantages both from a cost perspective and its flexibility in offering different shipping options has attracted companies to build more river terminals and upgrade existing facilities and refineries 
agricultural  industrial products  coal  crude oil and chemicals are the main commodities moving through the region 
at the end of  the average age of the inland river services dry cargo barge fleet was seven years old  which the company believes is among the youngest fleets operating on the us inland river waterways system 
inland river services believes that approximately of the dry cargo barge fleet operating on the us inland river waterways is over years old 
inland river services believes the relatively young age of its dry cargo barge fleet enhances its availability and reliability  reduces downtime for repairs and obviates  for the immediate future  the necessity of replacement capital expenditures to maintain its fleet size and revenue generating capacity 

table of contents the aggregate cost of inland river services operations depends primarily on the size and mix of its fleet
