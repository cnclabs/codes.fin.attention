management s overview of financial performance we are a year old diversified financial services company headquartered in seattle  washington  serving consumers and businesses primarily in the pacific northwest and hawaii 
the company is principally engaged in real estate lending  including mortgage banking activities  and retail and commercial banking operations 
our primary subsidiaries are homestreet bank the bank and homestreet capital corporation 
homestreet bank is a washington state chartered savings bank that provides residential and commercial loans  deposit products and services  non deposit investment products  and cash management services 
homestreet bank primary loan products include single family residential mortgages  loans secured by commercial real estate  loans for residential and commercial real estate construction  and commercial business loans 
homestreet capital corporation  a washington corporation  originates  sells and services multifamily mortgage loans under the fannie mae delegated underwriting and servicing program dus dus is a registered trademark of fannie mae 
in conjunction with homestreet bank 
doing business as homestreet insurance  we provide insurance products and services for consumers and businesses 
we additionally offer single family home loans through our partial ownership in an affiliated business arrangement known as windermere mortgage services series llc wms llc 
we generate revenue through positive net interest income and by earning noninterest income 
net interest income is primarily the difference between our interest income earned on loans and investment securities less the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 
we earn noninterest income from the origination  sale and servicing of loans and fees earned on deposit services and investment and insurance sales 
at december   we had total assets of billion  net loans held for investment of billion  deposits of billion and shareholders equity of million 
at december   we had total assets of billion  net loans held for investment of billion  deposits of billion and shareholders equity of million 
our reported net income of million for the year ended marked a significant increase in profitability  reflecting our success in growing our mortgage lending business and our commercial and consumer businesses 
as discussed below  during we improved or expanded major components of our business  including recapitalizing the company  upgrading the bank regulatory standing  expanding our mortgage origination capacity and market share  improving the quality of our deposits  bolstering our processing  compliance and risk management capabilities  and achieving significantly improved results of operations 
the board of directors twice approved for forward splits of the company common stock that were effective on march  and november   respectively 
shares outstanding and per share information have been adjusted to reflect the stock splits 
financial performance 
table of contents for  we achieved record net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per share  for return on average equity was for  compared to for  while the return on average assets was for  compared to for our record net income in resulted from a million increase in net revenue compared to our strong revenue growth in mostly reflected the significant growth in mortgage loan origination and sale activities driven by high mortgage production volume and strong secondary market profit margins that persisted throughout we also continued to expand our mortgage production capacity by increasing our mortgage origination and support personnel by during the year 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  was million in  an increase of million  or  compared to net interest income of million in our net interest margin for improved to from for the improvement in our net interest income and net interest margin in large part reflects the execution of our deposit product and pricing strategy  as growth in transaction and savings account balances more than offset maturities of higher yielding certificates of deposit 
additionally  higher average balances of loans held for sale from increased loan production and higher average balances of investment securities from the use of proceeds from our initial public offering increased our average balances of interest earning assets in provision for credit losses was million in  compared to million in asset quality trends improved during the year as nonaccrual loans declined to million at december   a decrease of million  or  from million at december  loan delinquencies also decreased  with total loans past due decreasing to of loans held for investment at december   compared to at december  overall  the allowance for credit losses decreased to million  or of loans held for investment at december   down from million  or of total loans held for investment at december  noninterest income was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in our noninterest income is heavily dependent upon our single family mortgage banking activities  which are comprised of mortgage origination and sale activities and mortgage servicing activities 
the increase in noninterest income is predominantly due to higher net gain on mortgage loan origination and sale activities  which totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or  year over year 
this income was partially offset by a million decrease in mortgage servicing income in compared to prior year  primarily due to mortgage servicing rights msrs risk management results 
noninterest expense was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in noninterest expense increased primarily due to salaries and related costs  which increased million in compared to  primarily higher incentive compensation  including commissions to lending personnel  driven by growth in single family closed loan production volume and increased headcount as we invested in growth and diversification 
this increase was partially offset by lower other real estate owned oreo expenses  which was million in  a decrease of million from oreo expense of million in income tax expense was million in compared to an income tax benefit of thousand in the company tax expense is based on the company annual effective income tax rate plus discrete benefits recognized during the year 
the company effective tax rate for the year of differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to a million tax benefit related to the reversal of the company beginning of year valuation allowance against deferred tax assets during the second quarter of  tax exempt income and state income taxes in oregon  hawaii and idaho 
asset quality management believes that the company s allowance for loan losses is at a level appropriate to cover estimated incurred losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio 
our credit risk profile has improved since december  as illustrated by the credit trends below 
we recorded an million provision for credit losses in compared to million in net charge offs were million in compared to million in the allowance for loan losses which excludes the allowance for unfunded commitments decreased to million at december   or of loans held for investment  compared to million  or of total loans held for investment  at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses since december  primarily reflects reductions in specific reserves from charge offs related to the resolution of certain nonaccrual loans as they were transferred to oreo 
additionally  the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio improved during as reflected in decreased nonaccrual loans and total loan delinquencies 

table of contents nonperforming assets decreased to million at december   from million at december  nonaccrual loans declined to million at december   compared to million at december  past due loans totaled million  or of total loans  at december   compared to million  or of total loans  at december  oreo balances decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  in april  bankruptcy courts affirmed the company s settlement of collection litigation related to two nonperforming construction land development loans with aggregate carrying values of million 
as a result  we charged off million related to these two loans  transferred the estimated net recovery value of million to oreo and subsequently sold the properties 
expansion of mortgage banking operations during  we expanded our mortgage origination capacity  accelerating our strategic plan to increase mortgage origination volume and market share by hiring mortgage origination and support personnel  a significant portion of whom were previously employed in washington and idaho by metlife home loans 
this number included metlife former pacific northwest regional sales manager and its regional builder services manager  as well as regional and branch managers  loan officers and related production support staff 
in  we opened new mortgage loan origination offices in washington  oregon and idaho to accommodate the expansion of these operations 
capital we improved our bank regulatory capital ratios during  increasing our tier leverage and total risk based capital ratios to and  compared with and at december   respectively 
this improvement reflects the completion of our initial public offering of common stock as well as our earnings in on february   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock for an initial offering price of per share after giving effect to the for forward stock split effective march  and the for forward stock split effective november  
the net increase in homestreet capital was million  of which million was contributed to the bank on february  with an additional million contributed on april  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expense in the financial statements 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  involve the application of highly sensitive and judgmental estimates and assumptions 
some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are highly complex and contain inherent uncertainties 
it is possible that  in some instances  different estimates and assumptions could reasonably have been made and used by management  instead of those we applied  which might have produced different results that could have had a material effect on the financial statements 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that  due to the inherent judgments and assumptions and the potential sensitivity of the financial statements to those judgments and assumptions  are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
we believe that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company financial statements are appropriate 
for a further description of our accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the financial statement to this form k 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of incurred credit losses inherent within our loan portfolio 
determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of the factors then prevailing  may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in those future periods 
we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our allowance for loan losses that has two basic components first  an asset specific component involving the identification of impaired loans and the measurement of impairment for each individual loan identified  and second  a formula based component for estimating probable principal losses for all other loans 
an asset specific allowance for impaired loans is established based on the amount of impairment calculated on those loans and charging off amounts determined to be uncollectable 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that all contractual 
table of contents principal and interest payments due will not be collected substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement 
factors we consider in determining whether a loan is impaired include payment status  collateral value  borrower financial condition  guarantor support and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
when a loan is identified as impaired  impairment is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or based on the loan s observable market price 
for impaired collateral dependent loans  impairment is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the fair value of the collateral is adjusted for the estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent on the sale rather than only on the operation of the collateral 
in accordance with our appraisal policy  the fair value of impaired collateral dependent loans is based upon independent third party appraisals or on collateral valuations prepared by in house appraisers  which generally are updated every six months 
we require an independent third party appraisal at least annually for substandard loans and other real estate owned oreo 
once a third party appraisal is six months old  or if our chief appraiser determines that market conditions  changes to the property  changes in intended use of the property or other factors indicate that an appraisal is no longer reliable  we perform an internal collateral valuation to assess whether a change in collateral value requires an additional adjustment to carrying value 
a collateral valuation is a restricted use report prepared by our internal appraisal staff in accordance with our appraisal policy 
upon the receipt of an updated appraisal or collateral valuation  loan impairments are remeasured and recorded 
if the calculated impairment is determined to be permanent  fixed or nonrecoverable  the impairment will be charged off 
loans designated as impaired are generally placed on nonaccrual and remain in that status until all principal and interest payments are current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement are reasonably assured  at which point the loan is returned to accrual status 
see credit risk management asset quality and nonperforming assets discussions within management discussion and analysis of this form k 
in estimating the formula based component of the allowance for loan losses  loans are segregated into homogeneous loan classes 
loans are designated into loan classes based on loans pooled by product types and similar risk characteristics or areas of risk concentration 
credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loan type and asset quality rating aqr or delinquency bucket 
this model calculates an expected loss percentage for each loan category by considering the probability of default  based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by aqr or delinquency buckets using one year analysis periods  and the potential severity of loss  based on the aggregate net lifetime losses incurred per loan class 
the formula based component of the allowance for loan losses also considers qualitative factors for each loan class  including the following changes in lending policies and procedures  international  national  regional and local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio  including the condition of various markets  the nature of the loan portfolio  including the terms of the loans  the experience  ability and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff  the volume and severity of past due and adversely classified or graded loans and the volume of nonaccrual loans  the quality of our loan review and process  the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio 
qualitative factors are expressed in basis points and are adjusted downward or upward based on management s judgment as to the potential loss impact of each qualitative factor to a particular loan pool at the date of the analysis 
additionally  our credit administration department continually monitors conditions that affect the carrying values of our collateral  including local and regional economic factors as well as asset specific factors such as tax values  comparable sales and other factors that affect or suggest changes in the actual collateral values 
they also monitor and adjust for changes in comparable sales or competing projects  changes in zoning or entitlement status  changes in occupancy rates for income properties and similar factors 
if we deem such factors to be significant  we generally perform an internal collateral valuation or will order an independent appraisal sooner than required under our appraisal policy 

table of contents the provision for loan losses recorded through earnings is based on management s assessment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level appropriate to cover probable incurred losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio 
the amount of provision and the corresponding level of allowance for loan losses are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience and other significant qualitative factors 
the allowance for loan losses  as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition  is adjusted by a provision for loan losses  which is recognized in earnings  and reduced by the charge off of loan amounts  net of recoveries

fair value of financial instruments  single family msrs and oreo a portion of our assets are carried at fair value  including mortgage servicing rights  single family loans held for sale  interest rate lock commitments  investment securities available for sale and derivatives used in our hedging programs 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fair value is based on quoted market prices  when available 
in certain cases where a quoted price for an asset or liability is not available  the company uses valuation models to estimate its fair value 
these models incorporate inputs such as forward yield curves  loan prepayment assumptions  expected loss assumptions  market volatilities  and pricing spreads utilizing market based inputs where readily available 
we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those that would be used by other market participants 
however  imprecision in estimating unobservable inputs and other factors may result in these fair value measurements not reflecting the amount realized in an actual sale or transfer of the asset or liability in a current market exchange 
a three level valuation hierarchy has been established under asc for disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the levels are defined as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date 
an active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
this includes quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
these inputs reflect the company s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
significant judgment is required to determine whether certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value are included in level or level when making this judgment  we consider all available information  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used 
the classification of level or level is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to an instrument fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level the following is a summary of the assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and where the amounts are measured using significant level inputs 
the fair value of the remaining assets and liabilities were measured using valuation methodologies involving market based or market derived information  collectively level and measurements

on a quarterly basis  our asset liability management committee alco and the finance committee of the bank board of directors review the significant inputs used in level measurements 
additionally  at least annually alco obtains an independent review of the msr valuation process and procedures  including a review of the model architecture and the valuation assumptions 
the finance committee of the board provides oversight and approves the company s asset liability management policy 
we obtain an msr valuation from an independent valuation firm at least quarterly to assist with the validation of the results and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in measuring fair value 
in addition to the recurring fair value measurements shown above  from time to time the company may have certain nonrecurring fair value measurements 
these fair value measurements usually result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or impairment of individual assets 
as of december  and  the company level nonrecurring fair value measurements  totaling million and million  respectively  were based on the appraised value of collateral used as the basis for the valuation of collateral dependent loans held for investment and oreo 
real estate valuations are overseen by our appraisal department  which is independent of our lending and credit administration functions 
the appraisal department maintains the appraisal policy and recommends changes to the policy subject to approval by the credit committee of the company board of directors and company loan committee the loan committee  established by the credit committee of the company board of directors and comprised of certain of the company management 
appraisals are prepared by independent third party appraisers and our internal appraisers 
single family appraisals are generally reviewed by our single family loan underwriters 
single family appraisals with unusual  higher risk or complex characteristics  as well as commercial real estate appraisals  are reviewed by our appraisal department

income taxes in establishing an income tax provision  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income 
our interpretations may be subject to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions 
we monitor tax authorities and revise our estimates of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a quarterly basis 
revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and strategies and from the resolution of income tax controversies 
such revisions in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any given reporting period 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it is believed that these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 

table of contents after reviewing and weighing all of the positive and negative evidence  if the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence  then the company does not record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
if the negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence  then a valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets is recorded 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated statements of financial condition

the correction of this accounting error resulted in an increase to loans held for sale and a related increase to net gain on mortgage loan origination and sale activities in our consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of operations of million at and for the year ended december   representing a correction of the cumulative effect of the error for prior years  which was deemed immaterial

additionally  if a nonaccrual loan is placed back on accrual status or paid off  the accumulated interest collected on the loan is recognized at the time the loan is removed from nonaccrual status

average balances of investment securities increased primarily as a result of the investment of proceeds from our initial public offering 
total average interest bearing deposit balances declined from  mostly reflecting our deposit and pricing strategy  resulting in a managed reduction of higher cost certificates of deposit and replacement with transaction and savings deposits 

table of contents total interest income on a tax equivalent basis of million in increased million  or  from million in  primarily driven by increased average interest earning assets 
our average balance of loans held for sale increased by million  or  due primarily to our increased closed loan volume during the increase in interest income also reflects a higher average balance of investment securities  which increased million  or  in from we invested proceeds from the sale of loans and our initial public offering in investment securities with a shift towards higher yielding municipal securities  resulting in an increase in yield on investment securities of basis points

also contributing to the decrease in interest expense was the restructuring of fhlb advances  prepaying certain long term advances and using short term fhlb advances to meet short term mortgage origination and sales funding needs  which contributed to a basis point decline in interest cost on fhlb advances

noninterest income noninterest income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from our noninterest income is heavily dependent upon our single family mortgage banking activities  which are comprised of mortgage origination and sale activities and mortgage servicing activities 
the level of our mortgage banking activity fluctuates and is influenced by mortgage interest rates  the economy  employment and housing affordability  among other factors 
noninterest income in benefited from increased single family loan production  as borrowers continued to take advantage of historically low mortgage interest rates  and the expansion of our mortgage lending operations 
our single family mortgage banking closed loan originations designated for sale increased to billion in from billion in as we continue to grow our mortgage origination and production capacity and increased our mortgage lending and support personnel by during the increase in noninterest income  predominantly due to higher net gain on mortgage loan origination and sale activities  is detailed in the tables below

table of contents capacity and strong demand for both purchase and refinance mortgage loans in our markets  including refinances through the federal government expanded home affordable refinance program  primarily driven by record low mortgage interest rates 
also contributing to the improvement in net gain on mortgage loan origination and sale activities was an increase in gross revenue per loan that persisted throughout we continue to experience historically high margins as a result of a combination of historically low mortgage interest rates  which increased demand for mortgage loan products  coupled with capacity constraints of mortgage loan providers to process the elevated demand  resulting from industry consolidation and other factors 
the company records a provision for repurchase losses as a reduction to net gain on mortgage loan origination and sale activities  which was million for  compared to million in for further information on the company mortgage repurchase liability  see note  commitments  guarantees and contingencies to the financial statements of this form k

principally reflects changes in model assumptions and prepayment speed assumptions  which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates 
for the year ended december   mortgage servicing income of million decreased million from million in this decrease was primarily due to msr risk management results  which represents changes in the fair value of single family msrs due to changes in model inputs and assumptions net of the gain loss from derivatives economically hedging msrs 
the fair value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates  primarily due to the effect on prepayment speeds 
msrs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase mortgage prepayment speeds and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows of the msr asset 
certain other changes in msr fair value relate to factors other than interest rate changes and are generally not within the scope of the company msr economic hedging strategy 
these factors may include but are not limited to the impact of changes to the housing price index  the level of home sales activity  changes to mortgage spreads  valuation discount rates  costs to service and policy changes by us government agencies 
the net performance of the msr risk management activities in was a gain of million compared to a gain of million in the lower gain in largely reflects a reduction in sensitivity to interest rates for the company msrs  which has enabled the company to reduce the notional amount of derivative instruments used to economically hedge msrs 
the lower notional amount of derivative instruments  along with a flatter yield curve  resulted in lower net gains from

investments in these instruments involve a risk that actual prepayments will vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of the security

management monitors the portfolio of securities classified as available for sale for impairment  which may result from credit deterioration of the issuer  changes in market interest rates relative to the rate of the instrument or changes in prepayment speeds 
we evaluate each investment security on a quarterly basis to assess if impairment is considered other than temporary 
in conducting this evaluation  management considers many factors  including but not limited to whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security in light of adverse changes in expected future cash flows  the length of time the security has been impaired and the severity of the unrealized loss 
we also consider whether we intend to sell the security or whether we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  which may be at maturity 
based on this evaluation  management concluded that unrealized losses as of december  were the result of changes in interest rates 
management does not intend to sell such securities nor is it likely it will be required to sell such securities prior to recovery of the securities amortized cost basis 
accordingly  none of the unrealized losses as of december  were considered other than temporary 
loans held for sale were million at december   compared to million as of december   an increase of million  or

in september  the finance agency reclassified the fhlb as adequately capitalized 
the fhlb remains subject to a consent order and  as such  finance agency approval will continue to be required for all repurchases  redemptions and dividend payments on capital stock 

table of contents management periodically evaluates fhlb stock for other than temporary impairment based on its assessment of ultimate recoverability of par value  rather than recognizing temporary declines in value 
the determination of whether the decline affects the ultimate recoverability is influenced by criteria such as the significance of the decline in net assets of the fhlb as compared to the capital stock amount for the fhlb and the length of time this situation has persisted  commitments by the fhlb to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the fhlb  the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and  accordingly  on the customer base of the fhlb and the liquidity position of the fhlb 
the fhlb continues to benefit from a superior credit rating from standard poor s  which allows the fhlb to secure funding for its activities at attractive rates and terms  further supporting continued access to liquidity 
based on its evaluation  management determined there is not other than temporary impairment on the fhlb stock investment as of december  or december  accounts receivable and other assets was million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or

we define our business segments by product type and customer segment 
if the management structure or the allocation process changes  allocations  transfers and assignments may change 
we use various management accounting methodologies to assign certain balance sheet and income statement items to the responsible business segments  including a funds transfer pricing ftp method  which allocates interest income credits and funding charges between the segments and our treasury division  which then assigns to each such business segment a funding credit for its liabilities  such as deposits  and a charge to fund its assets 
an allocation of charges for services rendered to the business segments by centralized functions  such as corporate overhead  which are generally based on each segment s consumption patterns 
an allocation of the company consolidated income taxes on the basis of the effective tax rate applied to the segment s pretax income or loss 
effective january  management updated the ftp methodology it uses for reviewing segment results and managing the company s business segments 
under the previous ftp methodology  we computed the cost of funds from our current period s financial results and then allocated a portion of that cost of funds to each respective business segment 
this approach was based on internal financial results and updated for current period information  thereby providing an updated funding cost applied to certain assets or liabilities originated in prior periods 
the updated methodology is based on external market factors and more closely aligns the expected weighted average life of the financial asset or liability to external economic data  such as the us dollar libor swap curve  and provides a more consistent basis for determining our cost of funds to be allocated to each business segment 
the updated approach is also more consistent with ftp measurement techniques employed by other financial institutions 
we have reclassified all prior period amounts to conform to the current methodology and presentation 
in general  the impact of the ftp change resulted in a lower cost of funds as compared with the previous method  as the company s funding costs have generally been higher than market rates due to the historical structure of the deposit portfolio and wholesale borrowings

the company writes options in the form of interest rate lock commitments on single family mortgage loans that are exercisable at the option of the borrower 
interest rate lock commitment options are exercised when a borrower locks an offered interest rate for a loan application that requires closing of that loan within a specified time frame  typically within days 
we are exposed to market risk on interest rate lock commitments if interest rates rise between the effective date of the interest rate lock and the funding date of the loan

in our single family lending business  we sell residential mortgage loans to gses that include the mortgage loans in gse guaranteed mortgage securitizations 
in addition  the company pools fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans that are used to back ginnie mae guaranteed securities 
we have made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements 
we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify loan purchasers due to defects in the origination process of the loan  such as documentation errors  underwriting errors and judgments  early payment defaults and fraud 
these obligations expose us to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance that it may receive 
generally  the maximum amount of future payments we would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers plus  in certain circumstances  accrued and unpaid interest on such loans and certain expenses 
we do not typically receive repurchase requests from ginnie mae  fha or va 
as an originator of fha insured or va guaranteed loans  we are responsible for obtaining the insurance with fha or the guarantee with the va 
if loans are later found not to meet the requirements of fha or va  through required internal quality control reviews or through agency audits  we may be required to indemnify fha or va against loss 
the loans remain in ginnie mae pools unless and until they qualify for voluntary repurchase by the company 
in general  once a fha or va loan becomes days past due  we repurchase the fha or va loan to minimize the cost of interest advances on the loan

we manage the credit risk associated with our various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review  counterparty exposure limits and monitoring procedures 
from time to time  we may provide or obtain collateral from certain counterparties for amounts in excess of exposure limits as outlined by the counterparty credit policies of the parties

the following is a discussion of our risk management practices 
the risks related to credit  liquidity  interest rate and price warrant in depth discussion due to the significance of these risks and the impact they may have on our business 
credit risk management credit risk is defined as the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an obligor s failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company  including those in the lending  securities and derivative portfolios  or otherwise perform as agreed 
factors relating to the degree of credit risk include the size of the asset or transaction  the contractual terms of the related documents  the credit characteristics of the borrower  the channel through which assets are acquired  the features of loan products or derivatives  the existence and strength of guarantor support  the availability  quality and adequacy of any underlying collateral and the economic environment after the loan is originated or the asset is acquired 
our overall portfolio credit risk is also impacted by asset concentrations within the portfolio 
our credit risk management process is primarily governed centrally 
our overall credit process includes comprehensive credit policies  judgmental or statistical credit underwriting  frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling and loan review  quality control and audit processes 
in addition  we have an independent loan review function that reports to the credit committee of the board  and internal auditors and regulatory examiners review and perform detailed tests of our credit underwriting  loan administration and allowance processes

the chief investment officer and treasurer reports directly to the chief executive officer 
appraisal policy an integral part of our credit risk management process is the valuation of the collateral supporting the loan portfolio  which is primarily comprised of loans secured by real estate 
we maintain a board approved appraisal policy for real estate appraisals that conforms to the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice uspap and fdic regulatory requirements 
our 
table of contents chief appraiser  who is independent of the business unit and credit administration departments  is responsible for maintaining the appraisal policy and recommending changes to the policy subject to loan committee and credit committee approval 
real estate our appraisal policy requires that market value appraisals be prepared at loan origination  subsequent loan extensions and for loan monitoring purposes 
our appraisals are prepared by independent third party appraisers and our staff appraisers 
we use state certified and licensed appraisers with appropriate expertise as it relates to the subject property type and location 
all appraisals contain as is values based upon the definition of market value as set forth in the fdic appraisal regulations 
for commercial properties we may also obtain upon completion and upon stabilization values as appropriate to the loan type and status 
the appraisal standard for the non tract development properties four units or less is retail value of individual units 
for tract development properties with five or more units  the appraisal standard is the bulk value of the tract as a whole 
we review all appraisals prior to approval of a loan transaction 
commercial real estate appraisals are reviewed by our in house appraisal staff 
single family appraisal reviews are generally conducted by our single family loan underwriters 
complex single family appraisals or appraisals with unusual characteristics are referred to our appraisal department for review 
for loan monitoring and problem loan management purposes our appraisal practices are as follows we generally do not perform valuation monitoring for pass graded credits due to minimal credit risk 
for loans graded special mention  an annual appraisal or collateral valuation is performed  depending upon property complexity  market area  market conditions  intended use and other considerations 
for loans graded substandard or doubtful and for all oreo properties  we require an independent third party appraisal every months until disposition or loan upgrade 
at the intervening six month point  we prepare a collateral valuation 
a collateral valuation is an in house appraisal report prepared by our staff appraisers 
in addition  if we determine that market conditions  changes to the property  changes in the intended use of the property or other factors indicate an appraisal is no longer reliable  we will also obtain an updated collateral valuation and assess whether a change in collateral value requires an additional adjustment to carrying value 
other our appraisal requirements for loans not secured by real estate  such as business loans secured by equipment  include valuation methods ranging from evidence of sales price or verification with a recognized guide for new equipment to a valuation opinion by a professional appraiser for multiple pieces of used equipment 
loan modifications in the current economic environment  we have modified loans for various reasons for borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties 
for example  we have extended maturities on certain loans to allow additional time for sales or leasing of residential and commercial real estate construction or rehabilitation projects 
other short term extensions have been granted to allow time for receipt of appraisals and other financial reporting information to facilitate underwriting of loan extensions and renewals 
when there is a well conceived and prudent workout plan that supports the ultimate collection of principal and interest  we may enter into a loan modification to help maximize the likelihood of success for a given workout strategy 
in each case we also assess whether it is in the best interests of the company to foreclose or modify the terms 
we have made concessions such as interest only payment terms  interest rate reductions  principal and interest forgiveness and payment restructures 
since mid  concessions to construction and land development borrowers have been focused primarily on forgiveness of principal in conjunction with settlement activities so as to allow us to acquire control of the real estate collateral 
for single family mortgage borrowers  we have generally granted interest rate reductions for periods of three years or less to reduce payments and provide the borrower time to resolve their financial difficulties 
in each case  we carefully analyze the borrower s current financial condition to assure that they can make the modified payment 
asset quality and nonperforming assets the primary markets in which we do business were impacted by the deterioration in the us housing market that began in faced with unfavorable market conditions  more borrowers with residential and commercial loans defaulted on their loans  thereby contributing to an increase in delinquency rates  which peaked in our loan portfolio during and continued to 
table of contents be higher than historical averages in we generally stopped our origination of new loans held for investment in to enable us to focus on problem loan resolution and improve overall asset quality

from the latter part of through december   substantially all of the loans we originated were single family mortgages that conform to gse underwriting standards and were designated for sale 
our underwriting standards for single family and home equity loans require evaluating and understanding a borrower s credit  collateral and ability to repay the loan 
credit is determined based on how well a borrower manages their current and prior debts  documented by a credit report that provides credit scores and the borrower s current and past information about their credit history 
collateral is based on the type and use of property  occupancy and market value  largely determined by property appraisals 
a borrower ability to repay the loan is based on several factors  including employment  income  current debt  assets and level of equity in the property 
we also consider loan to property value and debt to income ratios  loan amount and lien position in assessing whether to originate a loan 
single family and home equity borrowers are particularly susceptible to downturns in economic trends that negatively affect housing prices and demand and levels of unemployment 
for commercial  multifamily residential and construction lending  we consider the same factors with regard to the borrower and the guarantors 
in addition  we evaluate liquidity  net worth  leverage  other outstanding indebtedness of the borrower  an analysis of cash expected to flow through the borrower including the outflow to other lenders and prior experience with the borrower 
we use this information to assess financial capacity  profitability and experience 
ultimate repayment of these loans is sensitive to interest rate changes  general economic conditions  liquidity and availability of long term financing 
liquidity risk and capital resources liquidity risk management is primarily intended to ensure we are able to maintain cash flows adequate to fund operations and meet our obligations  including demands of depositors  draws on lines of credit and paying any creditors  on a timely and cost effective basis in various market conditions 
our liquidity profile is influenced by changes in market conditions  the composition of the balance sheet and risk tolerance levels 
homestreet  inc and homestreet bank have established liquidity guidelines and operating plans that details the sources and uses of cash and liquidity 
homestreet  inc and the bank have different funding needs and sources of liquidity and separate regulatory capital requirements 
homestreet  inc the main source of liquidity for homestreet  inc is proceeds from dividends from the bank and homestreet capital corporation 
in the past  we have raised longer term funds through the issuance of senior debt and trups 
historically  the main cash outflows were distributions to shareholders  interest and principal payments to creditors and operating expenses 
homestreet  inc s ability to pay dividends to shareholders depends substantially on dividends received from the bank 
under the company order  homestreet  inc is prohibited from paying dividends without regulatory consent 
the company was also contractually restricted from paying dividends to shareholders under the terms of our trups  for so long as the trups interest payments were being deferred 
we had deferred all interest payments on the trups from december until march   
table of contents when we paid all deferred and current interest owed on our outstanding trups 
as a result  no dividends were paid to the company shareholders in through on february   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock for an initial offering price of per share after giving effect to the for forward stock split effective march  and the for forward stock split effective november  
the net increase to homestreet capital was million  of which million was contributed to the bank on february  with an additional million contributed to the bank on april   leaving approximately million in available funds at the company to be used for general corporate purposes  including payment of deferred and current interest on our trups 
homestreet bank the bank s primary short term sources of funds include deposits  advances from the fhlb  repayments and prepayments of loans  proceeds from the sale of loans and investment securities and interest from our loans and investment securities 
we have also raised short term funds through the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the primary liquidity ratio is defined as net cash  short term investments and other marketable assets as a percent of net deposits and short term borrowings 
at december  our primary liquidity ratio was  compared with at december  at december  and  the bank had borrowing capacity of million and million from the fhlb  and million and million from the frbsf  respectively 
our lending agreement with the fhlb permits it to refuse to make advances during periods in which an event of default as defined in that agreement exists 
an event of default occurs when the fhlb gives notice to the bank of an intention to take any of a list of permissible actions following the occurrence of specified events or conditions affecting the bank 
the fhlb has not declared a default under this agreement  and has not notified the bank that future advances would not be made available  although it has required the bank to deliver physical possession of certain negotiable instruments and related documentation as collateral for borrowings under that agreement 
in recognition of the significant improvement in the bank financial condition  results of operations and risk profile  the federal reserve bank on july  granted full access to all federal reserve bank lending and depository services 
cash flows for the years ended december   and  cash and cash equivalents decreased million  increased million  and decreased million  respectively 
the following discussion highlights the major activities and transactions that affected homestreet cash flows during  and cash flows from operating activities the company operating assets and liabilities are used to support our lending activities  including the origination and sale of mortgage loans 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was used by operating activities  as higher mortgage production volumes during resulted in higher average balances of loans held for sale 
cash used to fund loans held for sale production was largely offset by proceeds from the sale of such loans 
we believe that cash flows from operations  available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by operating activities  resulting from the decision to accelerate the settlement of single family loans held for sale 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was used by operating activities  primarily to fund loans held for sale production 
cash flows from investing activities the company investing activities primarily include available for sale securities and loans originated and held for investment 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was used by investing activities  as we used the proceeds from our stock issuance to purchase available for sale securities 
net purchases in our investment securities portfolio were million during for the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by investing activities 
net proceeds from our investment loan portfolio were million during additionally  we realized net proceeds of million from the sale of oreo properties during for the year ended december   net cash of 
table of contents million was provided by investing activities  as the company used proceeds from the sale of investment securities to reduce balances of advances from the fhlb 
cash flows from financing activities the company financing activities are primarily related to customer deposits and net proceeds from the fhlb 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by financing activities 
we had net proceeds of million from fhlb advances as the company prepaid higher cost long term fhlb advances and replacing these borrowings with lower cost short term advances from the fhlb 
additionally  the company had net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock through our initial public offering and option exercises  which we used to invest in investment securities 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was used in financing activities as we reduced our fhlb advances as part of our balance sheet restructuring activities 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was used in financing activities  as deposits declined and we used proceeds from sales of investment securities to reduce balances of advances from the fhlb 
capital management federally insured depository institutions  such as the bank  are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital 
the fdic regulations recognize two types  or tiers  of capital core capital  or tier capital  and supplementary capital  or tier capital 
the fdic currently measures a bank s capital using total risk based capital ratio  tier risk based capital ratio and tier leverage ratio 
in order to qualify as well capitalized  a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
in order to be deemed adequately capitalized  a bank generally must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
the fdic retains the right to require a depository institution to maintain a higher capital level based on its particular risk profile 
as of december   the bank had a total risk based capital ratio  tier risk based capital ratio and tier leverage capital ratio of  and  respectively  compared with  and  respectively as of december  at december  the bank capital ratios continued to meet the regulatory capital category of well capitalized as defined by the fdic s prompt corrective action rules 
the following table presents the bank s capital amounts and ratios 

table of contents in thousands actual for minimum capital adequacy purposes to be categorized as well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio as of december  tier leverage capital to average assets tier risk based capital to risk weighted assets total risk based capital to risk weighted assets as of december  tier leverage capital to average assets tier risk based capital to risk weighted assets total risk based capital to risk weighted assets as of december  tier leverage capital to average assets tier risk based capital to risk weighted assets total risk based capital to risk weighted assets new proposed capital rules on june   federal banking regulators including the federal reserve and the fdic jointly announced that they were seeking comment on three sets of proposed regulations relating to capital the proposed rules 
the proposed rules would apply to certain depository institutions including the bank and their holding companies 
although parts of the proposed rules would apply only to large  complex financial institutions  a substantial portion of the proposed rules would apply to the bank and the company 
the proposed rules include requirements contemplated by the dodd frank act as well as certain standards adopted by the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs in december  which standards are commonly referred to as basel iii 
under the proposed rules  both the bank and the company would be required to meet certain minimum capital requirements 
the proposed rules introduce a new capital ratio of common equity tier i capital to risk based assets 
common equity tier capital would consist of retained earnings and common stock instruments  subject to certain adjustments 
both the company and the bank would be required to meet a common equity tier capital ratio of as well as a common equity tier capital conservation buffer of 
an institution that does not meet the conservation buffer would be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends  stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers 
in addition  both the company and the bank would be subject to a tier leverage ratio of  a tier risk based ratio of and a total risk based ratio of 
the prompt corrective action rules would be modified to include a common equity tier capital component and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds 
for example  the requirements for the bank to be considered well capitalized would be a tier leverage ratio  a common equity tier risk based capital ratio  an tier risk based ratio and a total risk based capital ratio 
to be adequately capitalized  those ratios would be   and  respectively 
the proposed rules would make changes in the methods of calculating certain risk based assets  which would in turn affect the calculation of risk based ratios 
higher or more sensitive risk weights would be assigned to various categories of assets  including residential mortgages  commercial real estate  credit facilities that finance the acquisition  development or construction of real property  certain exposures or credits that are days past due or on nonaccrual  foreign exposures  certain corporate exposures and securitization exposures 
in addition  the proposed rules would modify the manner in which certain capital elements are determined  including but not limited to  the phasing out of trust preferred securities as a component of tier capital and requiring certain deductions related to mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets 

table of contents the new required capital ratios and the enhanced prompt corrective action rules would generally be phased in beginning in and would take full effect on january  the conservation buffer would be phased in beginning in and would take full effect on january  the new calculations of risk weighted assets would take effect on january  various other modifications may have later phase in and full implementation dates 
the proposed rules have not been finalized by the banking regulators due to the volume of comments received during the comment period 
we cannot predict at this time when or in what form final rules will be adopted 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements presented in this form k have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts or market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the cost of our operations as incurred 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
operational risk management operational risk is defined as the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems  misconduct or errors  and adverse external events 
each line of business has primary responsibility for identifying  monitoring and controlling its operational risks 
in addition  centralized departments such as our credit administration  enterprise risk management  compliance and regulatory affairs  legal  security  information security  finance and human resources provide support to the business lines as they develop and implement risk management practices specific to their needs 
our internal audit department provides independent feedback on the strength of operational risk controls and compliance with company policies and procedures 
additionally  we maintain mature change management  business resumption and data and customer information security processes 
we also maintain a code of conduct with periodic training  setting a tone from the top that articulates a strong focus on compliance and ethical standards and a zero tolerance approach to unethical or fraudulent behavior 
compliance regulatory risk management compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of  or nonconformance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  internal policy and procedures or ethical standards 
as a regulated financial institution with a significant mortgage banking operation  we have significant compliance and regulatory risk 
historically  we have maintained a strong compliance culture and compliance management processes as evidenced by minimal compliance issues 
each business unit is responsible for compliance with laws and regulations and has identified an individual to participate on our compliance committee  which is chaired by the compliance officer 
the compliance officer monitors all new regulations and changes to existing regulations and the new requirements are discussed at the management compliance committee to determine impact to the business units and to assign responsibilities and timelines for implementation 
management has established a tracking process for monitoring the status of pending regulations and for implementing the regulatory requirements as they are published and become effective 
strategic risk management strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings  capital or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions  improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry changes 
strategic risk is managed by the board and senior management through development of strategic plans  successful implementation of business initiatives and reporting to the board and its committees 
reputation risk management reputation risk is defined as the risk to current or anticipated earnings  capital or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion 

table of contents we believe that we have an excellent reputation in the community primarily due to our longevity and significant outreach to the communities we serve 
the bank has earned outstanding ratings on every one of its bank community reinvestment act cra examination since accounting developments see financial statements and supplementary data note  summary of significant accounting policies  for a discussion of accounting developments 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income  fair value measurements and capital to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are price and interest rate risks 
price risk is defined as the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of either assets or liabilities that are entered into as part of distributing or managing risk 
interest rate risk is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates 
for the company  price and interest rate risks arise from the financial instruments and positions we hold 
this includes loans  mortgage servicing rights  investment securities  deposits  borrowings  long term debt and derivative financial instruments 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
our real estate loan portfolio is subject to risks associated with the local economies of our various markets and  in particular  the regional economy of the pacific northwest 
our price and interest rate risks are managed by the bank s asset liability management committee alco  a management committee that identifies and manages the sensitivity of earnings or capital to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives 
alco is a management level committee whose members include the chief investment officer  acting as the chair  the chief executive officer and other members of management 
the committee meets monthly and is responsible for understanding the nature and level of the company interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity  assessing how that risk fits within our overall business strategies  ensuring an appropriate level of rigor and sophistication in the risk management process for the overall level of risk  complying with and reviewing the asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet mix and earnings 
the finance committee of the board provides oversight of the asset liability management process  reviews the results of interest rate risk analysis and approves policies 
the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities are the principal items affecting net interest income 
changes in net interest spread interest rate risk are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  customer options option risk and changes in the shape of the yield curve time sensitive risk 
during the second half of  our loans held for investment portfolio experienced incremental net growth 
this growth was primarily centered on the origination of single family loans  while loan growth from other loan types was less significant 
we continue to manage and monitor the available for sale securities portfolio while maintaining a balance between risk and return 
the company funding strategy is to grow core deposits while we efficiently supplement using wholesale borrowings 
we estimate the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates using an interest rate simulation model that includes assumptions related to the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments for multiple interest rate change scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity depends on certain repricing characteristics in our interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities  including the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during the periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management 
table of contents seeks to ensure both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income and capital 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volume of assets and liabilities  at a point in time  that are subject to repricing at various time horizons  known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the following table presents sensitivity gaps for these different intervals

or less more than mos

assumes of interest bearing non maturity deposits are subject to repricing in three months or less 
based on contractual maturity 
as of december   the bank was asset sensitive overall  but liability sensitive in the three months or less  the more than three months to six months and the more than six months to twelve months periods 
the positive gap in the interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates that our net interest income would rise in the long term if market interest rates increase and generally fall in the long term if market interest rates decline 
changes in the mix of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin  without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an earning asset and its funding liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thereby impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 

table of contents these prepayments may have a significant impact on our net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of our actual exposure to changes in interest rates 
the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year and the change in net portfolio value as of december  and december  are provided in the table below 
for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes an instantaneous and sustained shift in market interest rates over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
december  december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change net interest income net portfolio value net interest income net portfolio value this percentage change represents the impact to net interest income and servicing income for a one year period  assuming there is no change in the structure of the balance sheet 
this percentage change represents the impact to the net present value of equity  assuming there is no change in the structure of the balance sheet 
at december   we believe our net interest income was asset sensitive because the repricing characteristics were such that an increase in market interest rates would have a slight negative effect on net interest income 
a decrease in market interest rates would have a greater negative effect on net interest income because assets would reprice more quickly than liabilities  decreasing revenue 
some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions that we could undertake to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected  in the actual level of market interest rates or competitive influences on our deposit base 
risk management instruments we originate fixed rate residential home mortgages primarily for sale into the secondary market 
these loans are hedged against interest rate fluctuations from the time of the loan commitment until the loans are sold 
we have been able to manage interest rate risk by matching both on and off balance sheet assets and liabilities  within reasonable limits  through a range of potential rate and repricing characteristics 
where appropriate  we also use hedging techniques including the use of forward sale commitments  option contracts and interest rate swaps 
in order to protect the economic value of our mortgage servicing rights  we employ hedging strategies utilizing derivative financial instruments including forward interest rate swaps  options on interest rate swap contracts and commitments to purchase mortgage backed securities 
we utilize these instruments as economic hedges and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in current income as a component of mortgage servicing income 
our mortgage servicing rights hedging policy requires management to hedge the impact on the value of our mortgage servicing rights for a low probability  extreme and sudden increase in interest rates 
this policy requires that we hedge estimated losses to a maximum of a million loss  subject to the limitations of hedging effectiveness including market risk  basis risk  counterparty credit risk and others 
the following table presents the financial instruments we used for hedging purposes

fair value hedge in accordance with hedge accounting standards 
we may implement other hedge transactions using forward loan sales  futures  option contracts and interest rate swaps  interest rate floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements and us treasury options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies
