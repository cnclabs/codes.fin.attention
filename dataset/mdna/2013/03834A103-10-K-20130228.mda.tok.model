overview approach resources inc is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  production and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we focus on oil and gas reserves in oil shale and tight gas sands in the permian basin in west texas  where we lease approximately  net acres 
our drilling targets include the clearfork  wolfcamp shale  canyon sands  strawn and ellenburger zones 
we sometimes refer to the clearfork and wolfcamp zones together as the wolffork  and our development project in the permian basin as project pangea  which includes pangea west 
our management and technical team have a proven track record of finding and developing reserves through advanced drilling and completion techniques 
as the operator of all of our estimated proved reserves and production  we have a high degree of control over capital expenditures and other operating matters 
at december   our estimated proved reserves were million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe 
substantially all of our proved reserves are located in crockett and schleicher counties  texas 
important characteristics of our proved reserves at december   include oil  ngls and natural gas  proved developed  operated  reserve life of more than years based on production of mmboe  standardized measure of million  and pv of million 
at december   we owned and operated producing oil and gas wells in the permian basin  and we had an estimated  identified drilling and recompletion locations  of which were proved 
we also owned working interests in nine producing gas wells in the east texas basin 
activity our operations in focused on horizontal drilling in our wolfcamp oil shale resource play in the permian basin 
we drilled horizontal wells in  compared to horizontal wells in our early results in the wolfcamp play led us to invest in building an infrastructure system that we believe will reduce drilling and completion costs  improve drilling and completion efficiencies  reduce fresh water use and ensure transportation for our crude oil production to market 
we plan to continue to develop the wolfcamp shale in project pangea in focusing on the wolfcamp shale allows us to use our operating  technical and regional expertise that is important to interpreting geological and operating trends  enhancing production rates and maximizing well recovery 
production growth production for totaled mmboe mboe d  compared to mmboe mboe d in  a increase 
production for was oil  ngls and natural gas 
our continued development of 
table of contents project pangea increased oil production in  compared to on average  we operated two horizontal rigs and one vertical rig in  and drilled a total of gross net wells  of which gross net were waiting on completion at december  we also recompleted gross net wells in the wolffork in reserve growth in  our estimated proved reserves increased  or mmboe  to mmboe from mmboe 
our proved reserves at year end were oil  ngls and natural gas  compared to oil  ngls and natural gas at year end during  our proved oil reserves increased mmbbls  or  to mmbbls from mmbbls in reserve growth  and especially our oil reserve growth  in was driven by results in our wolfcamp oil shale resource play 
equity offering in september  we completed the offering and sold million shares of common stock at per share 
in october  the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional  shares 
after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction costs of approximately million  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the proceeds of the equity offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  fund our capital expenditures for the development of our wolfcamp oil shale resource play and for general working capital needs 
plans for in september  we announced a capital budget of million  which includes three rigs to drill horizontal wells targeting the wolfcamp shale 
we expect that our horizontal drilling in project pangea in will include pad drilling  which we believe will improve operating efficiencies and resource recoveries  while reducing facilities costs and surface impact 
we also may drill vertical wells targeting the wolffork or recomplete canyon sands wells in the wolffork during our objectives for include advancing our understanding of optimal well spacing  testing multi zone potential to enhance hydrocarbon recovery in our wolffork targets and improving our cost structure 
our capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors  including additional data on our wolfcamp oil shale resource play  results of horizontal and vertical drilling  completions and recompletions  including pad drilling  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  prevailing and anticipated prices for oil  ngls and gas  the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects  our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under gaap 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
segment reporting is not applicable to us as we have a single  company wide management team that administers all significant properties as a whole  rather than by discrete operating segments 
we track only basic 
table of contents operational data by area 
we do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area 
we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
successful efforts method of accounting accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
the significant principles for this method are geological and geophysical evaluation costs are expensed as incurred  dry holes for exploratory wells are expensed and dry holes for development wells are capitalized  and capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  including wells and related equipment and facilities  are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net capitalized costs related to proved properties  then we recognize an impairment charge in income from operations equal to the difference between the net capitalized costs related to proved properties and their estimated fair values based on the present value of the related future net cash flows 
proved reserves for the year ended december   we engaged degolyer and macnaughton  independent petroleum engineers  to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of of our reported proved reserves  in accordance with rules and guidelines established by the sec 
estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december   for oil  ngls and gas in accordance with sec rules 
changes in commodity prices and operations costs may increase or decrease estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
depletion expense for our oil and gas properties is determined using our estimates of proved oil  ngl and gas reserves 
a hypothetical decline in our december   estimated proved reserves would have increased our depletion expense by approximately million for the year ended december  see also item properties proved oil and gas reserves and note to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves 
derivative instruments and commodity derivative activities unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the option contracts using 
table of contents industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
changes in the derivative s fair value are currently recognized in the statement of operations unless specific commodity derivative hedge accounting criteria are met and such strategies are designated 
for qualifying cash flow commodity derivatives  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the commodity derivative is effective 
the ineffective portion of the commodity derivative is recognized immediately in the statement of operations 
gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to oil and gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for commodity derivative accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current income or expense in the statement of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled unrealized gain loss on commodity derivatives 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
accordingly  we record realized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of  from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized an unrealized gain of million and  respectively  from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december   fair value recorded on our balance sheet and a corresponding decrease to the gain on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
impairment of long lived assets all of our long lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as future sales prices for oil  
table of contents ngls and gas  future costs to produce these products  estimates of future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in commodity prices or downward revisions to estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves 
any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
provision for income taxes we estimate our provision for income taxes using historical tax basis information from prior years income tax returns  along with the estimated changes to such bases from current period activity and enacted tax rates 
additionally  we compare liabilities to actual settlements of such assets or liabilities during the current period to identify considerations that might affect the current period s estimate 
valuation of share based compensation our plan allows grants of stock and options to employees and outside directors 
granting of awards may increase our general and administrative expenses  subject to the size and timing of the grants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with gaap  we calculate the fair value of share based compensation using various valuation methods 
the valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value 
we use i the black scholes option price model to measure the fair value of stock options  ii the closing stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards  including performance based awards  and iii the monte carlo simulation method for the fair value of market based awards 
equity method investments for investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not have control  we follow the equity method of accounting 
in september  we entered into a joint venture to build an oil pipeline in crockett and reagan counties  texas  which will be used to transport our oil to market 
in october  we made an initial contribution of million to the joint venture for pipeline and facilities construction 
this initial contribution was recorded at cost 
our equity investment is classified as a noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet at december  our share of the investee s losses was recorded on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property and equipment 
it may also increase the cost of labor or supplies 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth summary information regarding oil  ngl and gas revenues  production  average product prices and average production costs and expenses for the last three years 
we determined the boe using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one boe  and one barrel of ngls to one boe 
the ratios of six mcf of natural gas to one boe and one barrel of ngls to one boe do not assume price equivalency and  given price differentials  the price for a boe for natural gas or ngls may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil

oil  ngl and gas sales 
oil  ngl and gas sales increased million  or  to million from million in the increase in oil  ngl and gas sales was due to an increase in production volumes  partially offset by a decrease in average prices received 
production volumes increased as a result of our development of project pangea in the permian basin

liquidity and capital resources we generally will rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and  to the extent that credit and capital market conditions will allow  future public equity and debt offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions depends upon our future operating performance  availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which is affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot predict whether additional liquidity from equity or debt financings beyond our revolving credit facility will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  in the foreseeable future 
our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices  production volumes and the effect of commodity derivatives 
prices for oil and gas are affected by national and international economic and political environments  national and global supply and demand for hydrocarbons  seasonal influences of weather and other factors beyond our control 
cash flows from operations are primarily used to fund exploration and development of our oil and gas properties 
we believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current development project 
however  we may determine to use various financing sources  including the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  debt  convertible securities and other securities for future development of reserves  acquisitions  additional working capital or other liquidity needs  if such financing is available on acceptable terms 
we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
using some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents liquidity we define liquidity as funds available under our revolving credit facility plus year end net cash and cash equivalents

at december   we had a working capital deficit of million  compared to a working capital deficit of million and a working capital surplus of million at december  and  respectively 
the change in working capital during and is primarily attributable to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities to fund capital expended on our development project 
our working capital deficits have been historically attributable to accounts payable and accrued liabilities and have been more than offset by liquidity available under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent we operate or end with a working capital deficit  we expect such deficit to be more than offset by liquidity available under our revolving credit facility

we repaid a total of million  million and million of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility for  and  respectively 
our current goal is to manage our borrowings to help us maintain financial flexibility and liquidity  and to avoid the problems associated with highly leveraged companies with large interest costs and possible debt reductions restricting ongoing operations 
capital expenditures in september  we announced a capital budget of million  which includes three rigs to drill horizontal wells targeting the wolfcamp shale 
we expect that our horizontal drilling in project pangea in 
table of contents will include pad drilling  which we believe will improve operating efficiencies and resource recoveries while reducing facilities costs and surface impact 
we also may drill vertical wells targeting the wolffork or recomplete canyon sands wells in the wolffork during our objectives for include advancing our understanding of optimal well spacing  testing multi zone potential to enhance hydrocarbon recovery in our wolffork targets and improving our cost structure 
our capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors  including additional data on our wolfcamp oil shale resource play  results of horizontal and vertical drilling  completions and recompletions  including pad drilling  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  prevailing and anticipated prices for oil  ngls and gas  the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects  our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms 
revolving credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility with a borrowing base set at million 
the borrowing base is redetermined semi annually on or before each april and october based on our oil and gas reserves 
we or the lenders can each request one additional borrowing base redetermination each calendar year 
the maturity date under our revolving credit facility is july  borrowings bear interest based on the agent bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to  or the sum of the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
margins vary based on the borrowings outstanding compared to the borrowing base 
in addition  we pay an annual commitment of of unused borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
we had outstanding borrowings of million and million under our revolving credit facility at december   and  respectively 
the interest rate applicable to our revolving credit facility at december   and  was and  respectively 
we also had outstanding unused letters of credit under our revolving credit facility totaling  at december   which reduce amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
loans under our revolving credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our west texas assets  a pledge of our equity interests in our subsidiaries  and are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
covenants our credit agreement contains two principal financial covenants a consolidated modified current ratio covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of not less than to at all times 
the consolidated modified current ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated current assets as defined in the credit agreement by consolidated current liabilities as defined in the credit agreement 
as defined more specifically in the credit agreement  the consolidated modified current ratio is calculated as current assets less current unrealized gains on commodity derivatives plus the available borrowing base at the respective balance sheet date  divided by current liabilities less current unrealized losses on commodity derivatives at the respective balance sheet date 
a consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitdax ratio covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of not more than to at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitdax ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated funded debt as defined in the credit agreement by consolidated ebitdax as defined in the credit agreement 
as defined more specifically in the credit agreement  consolidated ebitdax is calculated as net income loss  plus exploration expense  depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  share based compensation expense  unrealized loss on commodity derivatives  interest expense  income and franchise taxes and certain other noncash expenses  less gains or losses from sales or dispositions of assets  
table of contents unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and extraordinary or nonrecurring gains 
for purposes of calculating this ratio  consolidated ebitdax for a fiscal quarter is annualized pursuant to the credit agreement 
our credit agreement also restricts cash dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of other debt  consolidations and mergers  the level of operating leases  asset sales  investments in other entities and liens on properties 
in addition  our credit agreement contains customary events of default that would permit our lenders to accelerate the debt under our credit agreement if not cured within applicable grace periods  including  among others  failure to make payments of principal or interest when due  materially incorrect representations and warranties  failure to make mandatory prepayments in the event of borrowing base deficiencies  breach of covenants  defaults upon other obligations in excess of  events of bankruptcy  the occurrence of one or more unstayed judgments in excess of  not covered by an acceptable policy of insurance  failure to pay any obligation in excess of  owed under any derivatives transaction or in any amount if the obligation under the derivatives transaction is secured by collateral under the credit agreement  any event of default by the company occurs under any agreement entered into in connection with a derivatives transaction  liens securing the loans under the credit agreement cease to be in place  a change in control as defined in the credit agreement of the company occurs and dissolution of the company 
at december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants and had not committed any acts of default under the credit agreement 
to date we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access our revolving credit facility 
however  our lenders have substantial ability to reduce our borrowing base on the basis of subjective factors  including the loan collateral value that each lender  in its discretion and using the methodology  assumptions and discount rates as such lender customarily uses in evaluating oil and gas properties  assigns to our properties 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations include long term debt  daywork drilling contracts  operating lease obligations  asset retirement obligations and employment agreements with our executive officers 
we periodically enter into contractual arrangements under which we are committed to expend funds to drill wells in the future  including agreements to secure drilling rig services  which require us to make future minimum payments to the rig operators 
we record drilling commitments in the periods in which well capital expenditures are incurred or rig services are provided 
our commitment under daywork drilling contracts was million at december  in april  we signed a five year lease for approximately  square feet of office space in fort worth  texas 
in august  we expanded our office space under an amendment to the lease to approximately  square feet 
in december  we expanded our office space under an amendment to the lease to approximately  square feet 
in august  we further expanded our office space under a third amendment to the lease to approximately  square feet and extended the term of the lease to december  in december  we began rent payments under the third amendment  bringing our total office lease payment to approximately  per month 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 

table of contents at december   we had outstanding employment agreements with each of our five executive officers that contained automatic renewal provisions providing that such agreements may be automatically renewed for successive terms of one year unless the employment is terminated at the end of the term by written notice given to the employee not less than days prior to the end of such term 
our maximum commitment under the employment agreements  which would apply if the employees covered by these agreements were each terminated without cause  was approximately million at december  the following table summarizes these commitments as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt daywork drilling contracts operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations employment agreements with executive officers total borrowings under our credit agreement 
at december   daywork drilling contracts related to four drilling rigs were contracted through january   february   april  and july   respectively 
operating lease obligations are for office space and equipment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our asset retirement obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
general trends and outlook our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil  ngls and gas 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demand  which is impacted by domestic and foreign supply of oil  ngls and gas  overall domestic and global economic conditions  commodity processing  gathering and transportation availability and the availability of refining capacity  price and availability of alternative fuels  price and quantity of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  political conditions in or affecting other oil and gas producing countries  weather and technological advances affecting oil  ngl and gas consumption 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil  ngl and gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
a substantial or extended decline in oil  ngl and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and liquidity that may be accessed through our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and through capital markets 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
future finding and development costs are subject to changes in the industry  including the costs of acquiring  drilling and completing our projects 
we focus our efforts on increasing oil and gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is 
table of contents appropriate for long term operations 
our future cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to manage our overall cost structure 
like all oil and gas production companies  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
oil and gas production from a given well naturally decreases over time 
additionally  our reserves have a rapid initial decline 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to develop and identify additional reserves  farm ins or other joint drilling ventures  and by acquisitions 
however  during times of severe price declines  we may from time to time reduce current capital expenditures and curtail drilling operations in order to preserve liquidity 
a material reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities could materially reduce our production volumes and revenues and increase future expected costs necessary to develop existing reserves 
we also face the challenge of financing exploration  development and future acquisitions 
we believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current development project 
however  we may determine to access the public or private equity or debt markets for future development of reserves  acquisitions  additional working capital or other liquidity needs  if such financing is available on acceptable terms 
we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices  and other related factors 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for commodity derivative and investment purposes  not for trading purposes 
proved reserves estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december   for oil  ngls and natural gas in accordance with sec rules 
changes in commodity prices and operations costs may increase or decrease estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
depletion expense for our oil and gas properties is determined using our estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
a hypothetical decline in our december   estimated proved reserves would have increased our depletion expense by approximately million for the year ended december  commodity price risk given the current economic outlook  we expect commodity prices to remain volatile 
even modest decreases in commodity prices can materially affect our revenues and cash flow 
in addition  if commodity prices remain suppressed for a significant amount of time  we could be required under successful efforts accounting rules to write down our oil and gas properties 

table of contents we enter into financial swaps and options to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
we do not designate such instruments as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we record open commodity derivative positions on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and recognize changes in such fair values as income expense on our consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
the table below summarizes our commodity derivatives positions outstanding at december  commodity and time period contract type volume transacted contract price crude oil collar bbls d bbl bbl collar bbls d bbl bbl collar bbls d bbl bbl natural gas swap  mmbtu month mmbtu swap  mmbtu month mmbtu subsequent to december   we added to our commodity derivatives positions with a crude oil collar contract covering  bbls d for february through december at a contract floor of bbl and a ceiling of bbl 
we also added to our commodity derivatives positions with a midland cushing basis differential swap covering  bbls d from march through december at a price of bbl 
at december  and december   the fair value of our open derivative contracts was an asset of approximately million and a liability of approximately million  respectively 
jpmorgan chase bank  na and keybank national association are currently the only counterparties to our commodity derivatives positions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
jpmorgan is the administrative agent and a participant  and keybank is the documentation agent and a participant  in our revolving credit facility 
the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility is used as collateral for our commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the option contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized an unrealized gain of million and  from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of  from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december   fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding decrease to the gain on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 

table of contents to estimate the fair value of our commodity derivatives positions  we use market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use the best available information 
we determine the fair value based upon the hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
at december   we had no level measurements 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
our derivatives  which consist primarily of commodity swaps and collars  are valued using commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs and quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves 
where observable inputs are available  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  the instrument is categorized in level at december   all of our commodity derivatives were valued using level measurements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value 
at december   our level measurements were used to calculate our asset retirement obligation at december  additionally  level measurements were used to calculate our estimated fair value of our oil and gas properties in the east texas basin 
we valued these properties by estimating future discounted net cash flows of reserves using forward market prices adjusted for locational basis differentials and other costs
