item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended december  the md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in item of this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed elsewhere in this form k  particularly in item a 
risk factors and in the special note regarding forward looking statements preceding part i of this form k 
overview and outlook dover is a diversified global manufacturer focusing on innovative equipment and components  specialty systems  and support services provided through its four major operating segments communication technologies  energy  engineered systems  and printing identification 
the company entrepreneurial business model encourages  promotes  and fosters deep customer engagement which has led to dover well established and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industry leading product innovation 
overall  concluded as a solid performance year  with strong revenue  earnings  and cash flow growth  despite the backdrop of a low growth macro economic environment 
our consolidated revenue increased million or to billion  inclusive of acquisitions  and our gross profit increased by million or to billion 
the results were led by our strong positions in the energy  handset  refrigeration and food equipment  and other industrial markets 
in our energy segment  expanding production activity and strong downstream investments in distribution and retail fueling are among the trends that drove solid results during the year 
the strong production and downstream performance was partially offset by the softening north american rig count  which caused our year over year drilling end market comparisons to decline as the year progressed 
in all  the segment had solid performance  characterized by continuing growth and strong margins 
we expect this trend to continue in within our communication technologies segment  several oem launched new products in the handset market during the second quarter and our microelectronic mechanical mems microphone activity was very strong once the new oem product launches commenced 
however  our performance at sound solutions was weaker than anticipated 
the sound solutions business continued to work through operational challenges which led to lower volumes than anticipated for the year  however  they did experience sequential growth and margin improvement in the fourth quarter  relative to the earlier quarters  and we expect their performance to continue to improve in overall  we expect the handset market to be strong in  supported by numerous new product releases  coupled with the increased use of multiple microphones per handset 
our aerospace defense and medical technology markets were solid during the year  while our telecom market continued to be weak 
within our engineered systems segment  the refrigeration and food equipment markets were solid  as were most of our us industrial end markets 
the results of our fluid solutions platform continued to reflect good performance from our first quarter maag pump systems acquisition  which helped to mitigate the impact of a weakened market in europe 
we expect to be another solid year for engineered systems  as we leverage our recent acquisitions and continue our geographic expansion within our fluid solutions platform 
we anticipate customer wins  an active remodel market  expanded product offerings and recent acquisitions to drive growth within our refrigeration industrial platform 
in our printing identification segment  solid organic growth in our fast moving consumer goods market more than offset uneven demand in our industrial markets  which was impacted by weak europe and slowing china markets 
we anticipate the release of several new products in the first half of the year  traction of added sales and service resources in key regional markets  along with stable fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets to contribute to our growth 
margin performance in the segment steadily improved over the course of  driven by productivity and restructuring activities 
we expect incremental benefit from these activities to carry over into  enabling continued reinvestment in our product identification growth space 

table of contents in addition to our solid financial results  we continued to execute on our corporate strategy 
during  we continued to focus on our five key growth spaces of communication components  energy  fluids  refrigeration and food equipment  and product identification 
we invested billion on seven acquisitions that expanded our markets  enhanced our product offerings and broadened our customer base 
in advancing our strategy of focusing on our higher margin growth spaces  we have reclassified to discontinued operations two non core businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets 
we expect to divest these businesses in although solid performers  these businesses serve highly volatile end markets  and their sale should improve the consistency of our future results and enable management to focus on our key growth spaces 
in  we generated million in free cash flow  which enabled us to continue to invest in higher growth economies and innovation  and to continue our long tradition of raising our annual dividend  now standing at consecutive years 
lastly  in november of  we announced and began to execute on a billion share repurchase program  to continue to drive long term shareholder value 
with respect to our expectations for  we are targeting full year organic growth in the range of to inclusive of a negligible foreign exchange impact and acquisition related growth of approximately for acquisitions completed in based on these revenue assumptions  our profitability expectations and anticipated additional share buy backs  our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for is estimated to be in the range of to  and we expect our earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters 
if global or domestic economic conditions accelerate or deteriorate  our operating results for could be materially different than currently projected 

table of contents consolidated results of operations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified certain businesses in the printing identification segment to discontinued operations based on our decision to divest these businesses

all four of our segments generated organic revenue growth  with the majority attributed to volume increases driven by strength in the energy  handset  refrigeration and food equipment  and many of the other industrial markets served by our engineered systems segment 
approximately of our growth was generated by new products  particularly in our communication technologies segment  and geographic market expansion in our energy segment 
pricing had a negligible impact to revenue  as price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs  were partly offset by lower strategic pricing initiatives

non operating items interest expense  net  increased million or to million in primarily due to lower average levels of cash on hand at reduced interest rates  leading to million less of interest income in as compared with in  our interest expense  net  increased to million due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings during as compared with as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  in february of we issued million in new notes  receiving net proceeds of million  approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire million of notes which came due earlier that month  with the remainder used to fund first quarter acquisitions

income taxes we operate globally  and   and of our pre tax earnings in   and  respectively  were generated in foreign jurisdictions  where such earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are well below the us statutory rate 
we also benefit from tax holidays and incentives in a number of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
as a result  our blended effective tax rate is typically significantly lower than the us statutory rate 

table of contents the effective tax rate on continuing operations was compared to the rate of 
the and rates were favorably impacted by net discrete items  principally settlements with us federal and state taxing authorities totaling million and million  respectively 
after adjusting for discrete items  the effective tax rates were and for and  respectively

after adjusting for discrete and other items  the effective tax rate for was  which was higher than the adjusted effective tax rate for of due primarily to the geographic mix of earnings  with a greater proportion of our non us earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions having higher tax rates than in  when more of the non us earnings were generated in foreign jurisdictions having lower tax rates on average 
we believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled  which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
this decrease may result in an income tax benefit 
due to the potential for resolution of federal  state  and foreign examinations  and the expiration of various statutes of limitation  our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to million 
some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations 
we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations increased to million  or diluted earnings per share eps in  compared with earnings from continuing operations of million  or eps  in the increase in earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives  offset in part by higher acquisition related expenses and increased restructuring charges relative to the eps increase reflects the increase in earnings  as well as the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding for the period relative to as discussed in the financial condition section of this md a  we have repurchased incrementally more common shares in as compared to earnings from continuing operations increased to million  or eps in  compared with earnings from continuing operations of million  or eps  in the increase in dollar earnings and eps from continuing operations was primarily the result of higher revenues and the lower effective tax rate relative to discontinued operations we did not dispose of any businesses in however  in the fourth quarter  we announced our intent to divest everett charles technologies including the multitest business  collectively ect and dek international dek  two non core businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets 
the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented herein 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million million  net of tax in connection with the intended divestiture of ect 
as a result  in  we generated a net after tax loss from discontinued operations of million  or a loss of eps  reflecting million of net earnings from the operations of these businesses along with minor adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities  which were more than offset by the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge 
we sold three businesses in the third and fourth quarters of  and the operations of these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations in our net earnings from discontinued operations for totaled million  or eps  and includes net earnings of million from the operations of the businesses sold in and held for sale in  coupled with tax benefits of million and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities 
net earnings from discontinued operations also includes a million loss on the sale of the three businesses  inclusive of goodwill impairment

refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations 

table of contents restructuring activities restructuring activities during the year  we initiated restructuring actions relating to ongoing cost reduction efforts  including targeted facility consolidations and headcount reductions at certain businesses 
as a result  in  we incurred restructuring charges totaling million related to these programs  as follows the communication technologies segment incurred restructuring charges of million  primarily relating to a facility consolidation and related headcount reductions within its operations that serve the telecom infrastructure market to better reflect the current market dynamics  along with headcount reductions undertaken to facilitate management changes and optimize the cost structure of its businesses serving the consumer electronics market 
the energy segment incurred restructuring charges of million  primarily representing costs for the integration of recent acquisitions and minor headcount reductions 
the engineered systems segment incurred restructuring charges of million  mainly relating to facility consolidations and other headcount reduction programs undertaken to optimize its cost structure 
the printing identification segment incurred restructuring charges of million  principally relating to rationalization of global headcount within its marking and coding businesses to better align its footprint with present market conditions 
we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately to million in in connection with the above mentioned projects  as well as certain other programs to be initiated during the year to rationalize headcount and optimize operations in a few select businesses 
we anticipate that a significant portion of the charges will be incurred in the first quarter  with much of the benefit of the and programs being realized over the remainder of and into we also expect to fund the remainder of the programs currently underway  as well those commenced in  over the next to months 
in light of the economic uncertainty in certain of our end markets and our continued focus on improving our operating efficiency  it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of and restructuring activities restructuring initiatives in and were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations 
we incurred restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  relating to such activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional details regarding our recent restructuring activities 

table of contents segment results of operations this summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our four reportable operating segments communication technologies  energy  engineered systems  and printing identification 
each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple end markets

segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin  which are presented in the segment discussion that follows  are non gaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance 
we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years  as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors 
for further information  see the non gaap disclosures at the end of this item communication technologies our communication technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components which serve the following key markets consumer electronics  medical technology  aerospace defense  and telecom other 
for the reporting within this form k  and on a go forward basis  we have condensed our end market analysis into the four above mentioned markets  reduced from the analysis of five end markets in our prior annual and quarterly reporting

table of contents versus revenue generated by our communication technologies segment in increased by million or compared to the same period of the overall increase in revenue resulted primarily from increased microelectronic mechanical mems microphone volumes stemming from new product introductions and overall smart phone market growth  combined with a full year of revenue for sound solutions in compared to six months of revenue in our mems revenue grew in excess of over the level 
the revenue increase was partially offset by strategic pricing initiatives for our communications and telecommunication products  corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities  and reduced volumes in certain end markets 
our revenue in the consumer electronics market representing of segment revenue increased million or due to solid demand for components serving the handset market 
this growth was tempered in part by delays in the launches of certain oem products and operational challenges in the sound solutions business impacting its product rollouts which have led to lower volume for this portion of the business 
as anticipated  our sound solutions business experienced improvement in revenue and margin in the fourth quarter of relative to earlier quarters  and we expect this trend to continue in overall  our mems microphones remain well positioned to capitalize on this market growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands 
our medical technology revenue of segment revenue increased by million or due to increased hearing aid demand 
revenue derived from other medical products was unfavorably impacted by weakened european and asian economic conditions 
revenue derived from our aerospace defense market of segment revenue increased million or mainly due to continued increase in build rates of commercial aircraft and the timing and funding of key defense programs in which we participate 
the defense market in europe continues to be impacted by the weak macro economic environment 
we continue to experience weakened demand in the global telecom markets  driven in part by continued deferred industry investment 
this contributed to a revenue decrease of million or from our telecom other markets of segment revenue 
communication technologies earnings in decreased million or compared with  with a decrease in operating margin of basis points 
the earnings and margin decreases were mainly due to lower margins from the integration of sound solutions including a full year of incremental depreciation and amortization compared to six months in  new product ramp up costs and restructuring charges related to cost reduction activities  offset in part by productivity initiatives  leverage on higher mems volume  and the absence of one time acquisition related costs associated with the sound solutions 
bookings for the year ended december  and backlog at december  indicate continued strength across each of our end markets  with the exception of our telecommunication other market 
versus revenue generated by our communication technologies segment increased million or compared with  with million  or of the growth  attributed principally to the acquisition of sound solutions  which supplemented our product offerings in the growing handset market 
our organic revenue growth of was largely due to continued strong demand for smart phones serving the consumer electronics market which grew significantly year over year 
although there was an incremental decrease in revenue due to strategic pricing initiatives for our communication and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities  this decrease was more than offset by revenue growth from market share gains  new product introductions and product mix 
our revenue in the consumer electronics market representing of segment revenue increased million or  excluding sound solutions 
our mems microphones and sisonic technologies were well positioned to capitalize on this market growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands 
our medical technology revenue of segment revenue declined by million or principally due to softer hearing aid demand in the first half of and overall softer medical equipment demand 

table of contents our aerospace defense revenue of segment revenue increased million or 
we experienced solid demand in the commercial aerospace market due to increased build rates of commercial aircraft by leading aircraft manufactures and increased demand for our aftermarket products globally 
this increase was partially offset by revenue derived from our defense market mainly due to timing and funding of certain programs in which we participate 
our telecom other revenue of segment revenue decreased million or due to weakened demand in the global telecom markets  driven in part by deferred industry investment due to service provider consolidation 
communication technologies earnings increased compared with  but operating margin declined basis points 
the margin decline mainly resulted from higher acquisition related costs including incremental depreciation and amortization  higher raw material costs  and lower margins from the integration of the sound solutions acquisition 
excluding the impact of sound solutions  earnings would have increased by million  or  and operating margin would have increased by basis points as compared with energy our energy segment serves the oil  gas  and power generation industries with products that promote efficient and cost effective drilling  extraction  storage  and movement of oil and gas products  or constitute critical components for power generation equipment 
the energy segment operates through the following business lines drilling  which comprises products supporting the cost effective drilling of oil and gas wells  production  which comprises products and components facilitating the extraction and movement of fuel from the ground  and downstream  which comprises systems and products that support the efficient  safe  and environmentally sensitive handling of fuel  hazardous liquids  and dry bulk commodities

pricing actions  mainly in response to increased raw material costs  represented approximately of the revenue increase 
drilling revenue representing of segment revenue increased by million or due to an essentially flat level of drilling activity compared to  which moderated demand for the segment drilling products 
production revenue of segment revenue increased by million  with due to organic growth and from acquisitions 
organic growth was driven by an increased number of active us oil wells and wells with natural gas liquids driving demand for artificial lift products  higher international sales  and increased demand for compressor related products and winch products serving the infrastructure and recovery markets 
our revenues in the drilling sector  and to a smaller extent in the production sector  are impacted by changes in the number of active north american drilling rigs 
in  the average north american drilling rig count declined compared to the prior year 
we expect the north american rig count growth to turn positive in the second half of downstream revenue of segment revenue increased by million or  reflecting increased demand for loading equipment for the rail  cargo tank and chemical industrial markets  bearing products serving energy markets  and fuel delivery systems 
energy earnings in increased million or primarily resulting from higher volume in the production and downstream sectors 
operating margin increased basis points compared to the prior year due to improved operating leverage associated with higher volumes  strategic pricing  and productivity gains  which more than offset the impact of unfavorable product mix and higher acquisition related depreciation and amortization 
bookings for the year ended december  and backlog at december  increased and  respectively  compared to the prior year periods 
we expect market conditions in to moderate compared to  with continued geographic expansion and further penetration of new and acquired products and technologies are also expected to contribute to our growth in versus our energy segment posted record organic revenue  earnings  and bookings in revenue and earnings were up and  respectively  due to continued strength in the drilling  production  and downstream energy markets served by the segment 
recent acquisitions generated revenue growth of and contributed to the segment s record results 
sales outside of north america grew driven by significantly higher sales to central and south america  the middle east  and russia 
pricing actions  generally undertaken to offset commodity inflation  accounted for a marginal portion of the revenue increase 
drilling revenue representing of segment revenue grew due to increased exploration activity  pricing  and market share increases 
production revenue of segment revenue increased  with due to organic growth and from acquisitions 
the organic growth was driven by higher drilling and well completion activity  increased international sales  and higher demand for winch products serving the energy  infrastructure  and recovery markets 
our revenues in the drilling and production sectors are impacted by changes in the number of active north american drilling rigs 
the average north american drilling rig count in was up over the prior year  driven by strong oil prices 
downstream revenue of segment revenue was up  with from organic revenue growth and the balance from recent acquisitions 
the organic growth reflected continued strong demand for products in the power generation  rail  cargo tank  and chemical industrial markets  as well as nozzles and hanging hardware for retail fueling stations 

table of contents energy earnings increased million  or  from the higher organic and acquisition volumes 
energy operating margin declined basis points compared to the prior year  due to the impact of acquisition related costs  including higher depreciation and amortization  and higher material costs  partially offset by improved operating leverage associated with the higher volumes  strategic pricing  and productivity gains

table of contents financial condition we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing  and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dispositions  dividends  repurchase of outstanding shares  adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position  with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 
cash flow summary the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows years ended december  cash flows from continuing operations in thousands net cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities in increased million  primarily due to increased net earnings in and reduced investment in working capital relative to higher sales volume increased net earnings before depreciation and amortization by million as compared with our net cash flow increased million on the change in working capital year over year  as we converted working capital of approximately million to cash in  while we invested million in working capital in additionally  cash flow increased million from the year over year change in income tax accruals 
in  our tax provision exceeded our payments leading to an increase in the accrued tax balance  while in we made tax payments in excess of the provision  in part due to settlement activity  which reduced the accrued tax balance 
cash provided by operating activities in increased million  primarily due to increased earnings in and reduced investment in working capital relative to higher sales volume increased net earnings before depreciation and amortization by million as compared with our investment in working capital was million lower than in  at which time a working capital build up was necessary to support revenue levels recovering from the declines 
these increases in cash flow were partially offset by million of higher income tax payments resulting from our higher earnings and tax settlement activity  as well as higher employee incentive compensation payments and reductions in deferred revenue 
pension and post retirement activity 
post retirement costs relating to pension and other employee related defined benefit plans affect results in all segments 
we recorded net periodic benefit costs of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  relating to our benefit plans including our defined benefit  supplemental  and post retirement plans 
the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long term estimates  including discount rates used to value plan obligations  expected returns on plan assets  the service and interest costs  and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses 
in  the actual return on plan assets increased consistent with increased returns within the global equity markets 
in  the actual return on us plan assets increased  while returns on our us plans declined  as a result of the different mix of investments in the plans 
in  we expect our net periodic benefit cost to be approximately million  with the increase compared to being attributed to the lower discount rates used to value the post retirement obligations  higher amortization relating to unrecognized asset losses  and an increase in participants in our supplemental retirement plans 
the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets  the level of market interest rates  and the level of funding 
we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion  subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit plans reflected underfunding by million  which includes million relating to the us dover corporate pension plan and million relating to our significant international pension plans  some in locations where it is not economically advantageous to pre fund the plans due to local regulations

in  we expect to contribute to million to our us qualified defined benefit plan and approximately million to our non us plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion regarding our post retirement plans 
adjusted working capital 
in  adjusted working capital a non gaap measure calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable increased from by million  or  to billion  which reflected an increase in receivables of million  an increase in net inventory of million  and an increase in accounts payable of million  generally due to the impact of acquisitions 
excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of million  adjusted working capital would have decreased by million  or 
investing activities cash used in investing activities results from cash outflows for capital expenditures  acquisitions  and short term investments  partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses  property  plant and equipment  and short term investments 
in  we used cash in investing activities of billion compared to billion in  driven by the following factors acquisitions 
in  we used billion to acquire seven businesses  including million for maag pump systems  a european acquisition for our fluid solutions platform  million for the cash portion of the purchase price paid for pcs  a second quarter acquisition in our energy segment  and million for anthony international  a fourth quarter acquisition for our refrigeration industrial platform 
a portion of the pcs acquisition was also funded by the issuance of dover stock valued at million at the date of acquisition 
cash paid for the acquisitions is net of million received as final payment for settlement of purchase price adjustments for post acquisition contingencies relating to the sound solutions acquisition by our communication technologies segment 
in comparison  in  we used billion to acquire nine businesses  including million for the acquisition of harbison fischer by our energy segment and million for the acquisition of sound solutions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions 
capital spending 
capital expenditures  primarily to support capacity expansion  innovation  and cost savings  were million in and million in our capital expenditures were approximately million higher in the period as compared to  reflecting continued investment in capacity expansion to support growth in the handset market with significant investments to increase mems manufacturing capacity in our domestic and asian facilities  along with other investments supporting growth in our energy production end markets 
we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to approximate 
proceeds from sale of businesses 
in  we generated cash of million  primarily from the sale of paladin brands  crenlo  and heil trailer  three businesses that had operated in our engineered systems segment 
short term investments 
we typically invest cash in excess of near term requirements in short term investments 
in  we generated proceeds of million from the sale of short term investments  which were liquidated to provide cash for acquisitions 
we held no short term investments during we anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make through the remainder of will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and  if necessary  through the issuance of commercial paper  the use of established lines of credit  or accessing the public debt or equity markets 

table of contents financing activities our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends  offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options 
for  we used cash of million for financing activities compared to million in  with the activity attributed to the following long term debt 
in the period  we had negligible reductions in long term debt 
however  in the period  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of year notes due and year notes due these proceeds were used to fund acquisitions made in the first quarter of and repay million of other borrowings which came due during the period 
notes payable 
in december  we received proceeds of million from commercial paper issued principally to fund the fourth quarter anthony acquisition 
treasury purchases 
in november  dover board of directors approved an additional billion stock repurchase program  to drive additional shareholder value 
as a result  our activity includes incremental share buy backs under the above mentioned program and the repurchase of shares to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued for the second quarter acquisition of pcs  in addition to the typical repurchase of shares to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under our equity compensation plans 
in total  we used million in to purchase million shares of our common stock in the open market 
in  we purchased approximately million shares for million 
dividend payments 
total dividend payments to common shareholders were million in and million in our dividends per common share increased to per share in compared to per share in this represents the th consecutive year that our dividend has increased 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we received million from employee exercises of stock options in  compared to million in  with the variance attributed to a greater number of options exercised in the period 
cash flows from discontinued operations in   and our businesses reported as discontinued operations generated cash flow of million  million  and million  respectively 
the and amounts reflect cash flows from the three businesses sold in the third and fourth quarters of  as well as cash flows from the two businesses reclassified to discontinued operations in the significant decrease in cash flows from discontinued operations  relative to the prior years  reflects a significant decrease in earnings from the businesses reclassified in  as well as the the absence of cash flows from the businesses sold in liquidity and capital resources free cash flow in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure free cash flow a non gaap measure 
we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt  pay dividends  fund acquisitions  and repurchase our common stock 
for further information  see the non gaap disclosures at the end of this item the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities years ended december  free cash flow dollars in thousands cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 
table of contents for  we generated free cash flow of million  representing of revenue and of earnings from continuing operations  while continuing to make investments necessary to support our growth 
free cash flow in was million or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue in the increase in free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and a million positive change in working capital year over year  offset in part by higher capital expenditures in necessary to fund expansion in the company s high growth businesses 
we expect to generate free cash flow in of approximately of revenue  consistent with our historical performance 
the increase in free cash flow compared to reflects higher earnings from continuing operations and lower investment in working capital  partially offset by higher tax payments and increased capital expenditures in net debt to net capitalization we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation a non gaap measure to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures net debt to net capitalization ratio dollars in thousands december  december  december  current maturities of long term debt commercial paper long term debt total debt less cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments net debt add stockholders equity net capitalization net debt to net capitalization our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at december  compared to the prior year end  primarily due to the use of cash and borrowings to fund acquisitions totaling billion during the year 
total borrowings are higher by million at december   primarily due to commercial paper issued in the fourth quarter to fund acquisitions 
we expect to replace these commercial paper borrowings with long term fixed rate notes in our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at december  compared to the year end primarily due to the use of cash and debt to fund acquisitions totaling billion during the year 
total net borrowings increased by million during  primarily due to million net proceeds received from the year notes due and year notes due issued in february  approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire million of notes which came due earlier in february in  we also received cash proceeds of million  primarily from the sale of three businesses 
we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes  including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock 
we currently maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to billion and expires on november  this facility is used primarily as liquidity back up for our commercial paper program 
we have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so 
if we were to draw down a loan  at our election  the loan would bear interest at a eurodollar or sterling rate based on libor  plus an applicable margin ranging from to subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by s p and moody s or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility 
under this facility  we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than to we were in compliance with this covenant and our other long term debt covenants at december  and had a coverage ratio of to we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

table of contents we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec with remaining capacity of billion that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes  including repayment of existing indebtedness  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  of which approximately million was held outside the united states 
cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less 
we regularly invest cash in excess of near term requirements in short term investments  which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months  up to twelve months 
we held no short term investments at december  or if our cash held outside of the us were to be repatriated  under current law  it would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments  including acquisitions 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated  and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 
management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs  including its cash needs in the united states 
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash flow to debt and debt to capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 
our credit ratings  which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies  were as follows as of december  short term rating long term rating outlook moody p a stable standard poor a a stable fitch f a stable we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk based interest rates for the foreseeable future 
acquisition spending and or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt 
operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements  including acquisitions and capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of december   we had approximately million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions  which expire at various dates in through these letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance  warranty and other performance obligations 
in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations  the probability of which we believe is remote 
we have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets  including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental  health and safety  tax  and employment matters 
we do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 

table of contents a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december  and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years other long term debt interest expense rental commitments purchase obligations capital leases supplemental post retirement benefits uncertain tax positions total obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent total long term debt  including current maturities 
amounts represent estimate of future interest payments on long term debt using the interest rates in effect at december  amount includes purchase obligations totaling  relating to businesses reported within discontinued operations at december  amounts represent estimated benefit payments under our supplemental and post retirement benefit plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also expect to contribute approximately to million to our qualified defined benefit plans in  which amount is not reflected in the above table 
amount in other column includes  reported within discontinued operations at december  due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions  we are unable to estimate the timing of the related payments  if any  that will be made subsequent to these amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions 
financial instruments and risk management the diverse nature of our businesses activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks  including those related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts  however  nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly rated  diversified counterparties 
interest rate exposure we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts 
we issue commercial paper  which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates  however  maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pre tax earnings 
we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long term and fixed rate in nature 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the year end fair value of our long term debt by approximately million 
however  since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments before their maturities  the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents foreign currency exposure we conduct business in various non us countries  primarily in canada  mexico  substantially all of the european countries  brazil  argentina  malaysia  china  india  and other asian countries 
therefore  we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers  and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks  when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities 
we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and or cash flow hedging programs 
we have not had material foreign currency hedging activity in recent years 
changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows when translated into us dollars  our reporting currency 
the strengthening of the u 
s dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non us operations 
we may  from time to time  for a specific exposure  enter into fair value hedges  and at december   we had one outstanding floating to floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of million in exchange for chf million  which matures on october  this transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in non us operations 
the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings  with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings 
the fair values at december  and reflected cumulative losses of million and million  respectively  due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of this arrangement 
commodity price exposure certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities  such as aluminum  steel  copper  and various precious metals  among others 
our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials 
when possible  we maintain long term fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts  however  we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire 
we may  from time to time  for a specific exposure  enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing  however  we had no such contracts outstanding at december  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments  and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense amounts we report 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures  including information regarding contingencies  risk  and our financial condition 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note the accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates 
we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to gaap and is consistently applied 
we review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis 
revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectability is reasonably assured  and d delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components  with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
service revenue represents less than of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed 
in limited cases  our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery  installation  testing  certification  or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized 
we do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements 
inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventories are stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories 
businesses within our communication technologies and printing identification segments tend to experience somewhat higher levels 
table of contents of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 
we have significant tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
our assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or  when indicators of impairment exist  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate  or when a significant portion of a reporting unit is to be reclassified to discontinued operations  during the interim periods 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analyses ie an income approach which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability 
changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses 
we believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we performed the annual impairment testing of our identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of  and the fair value of of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value by at least and  in most cases  significantly more 
if the fair value of each of these reporting units was decreased by  the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized 
the testing of the goodwill of our ect business upon reclassification to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter resulted in a goodwill impairment on the basis of the fair value assumptions predicated on an anticipated sale 
as a result  we computed a goodwill impairment of million million  net of tax that was recognized in the fourth quarter of within the results of discontinued operations 
the valuation of our pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
annually  we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns  economic trends and portfolio allocation 
our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams 
the plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year by year spot rates 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the weighted average discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit  supplemental  and other post retirement obligations ranged from to  reduced from the rates  which ranged from to 
the reduced discount rates are reflective of the decline in global market interest rates over these periods 
a basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at december  our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately million 
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated  using more likely than not criteria  for ongoing audits regarding federal  state  and international issues that are currently unresolved 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves 
reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates  and our future taxable income levels 
the provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 

table of contents we have significant accruals and reserves related to the self insured portion of our risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  our experience  and relevant industry data 
we review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience 
we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense 
the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues 
while we believe that the amount accrued to date is adequate  future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 
occasionally  we will establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation  in accordance with appropriate accounting principles 
these liabilities  for both severance and exit costs  require the use of estimates 
though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 
we will from time to time discontinue certain operations for various reasons 
estimates are used to adjust  if necessary  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  including goodwill  to their estimated fair market value 
these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale 
fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar type entities 
the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold 
changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates 
as noted above  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  as determined at the time one of our reporting units was reclassified to discontinued operations 
we will continue to evaluate the businesses held for sale for impairment at each reporting period 
we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  restricted stock  and performance share awards 
we use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of sars and stock options granted to employees 
the model requires that we estimate the expected life of the sar or option  expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data 
we use the monte carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also require us to estimate the volatility of our stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of our peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group 
for additional information related to the assumptions used  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
recently adopted accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asu which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
the company adopted this guidance on january  and its adoption did not significantly impact the company consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this asu only requires a change in the format of the current presentation 
the company adopted this guidance for its year end reporting  presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued asu which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test for goodwill impairment 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
this standard became effective for the company on january  its adoption did not impact the company consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer s participation in multiemployer pension plans 
the standard is intended to provide more information about an employer s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates 
this guidance became effective for the company for its fiscal year end reporting 
its adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinite lived intangible asset 
per the terms of this asu  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the entity determines  based on qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not  the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the revised standard is effective for dover for its annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the company does not expect adoption of this asu to significantly impact its consolidated financial statements 
non gaap disclosures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we also disclose non gaap information which we believe provides useful information to investors 
segment ebitda  segment ebitda margin  free cash flow  net debt  total debt  net capitalization  the net debt to net capitalization ratio  adjusted working capital  earnings adjusted for non recurring items  effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items  revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities  debt or equity  earnings  revenue  or working capital as determined in accordance with gaap  and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe that segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years  as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors 
segment ebitda is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings 
segment margin is calculated as segment ebitda divided by segment revenue 
we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity 
net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ 
free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions  pay dividends  repay debt  and repurchase our common stock 
reconciliations of free cash flow  total debt  and net debt can be found above in this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers 
we believe that reporting adjusted working capital also sometimes called working capital  which is calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable  provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue 
we believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency  which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes  given the global nature of our businesses 
we believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth  which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods

the company s management assessed the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  the company s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 
based on its assessment under the criteria set forth in internal control integrated framework  management concluded that  as of december   the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap 
in making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december   management has excluded maag pump systems  production control services  and anthony international  three companies acquired in purchase business combinations during these companies are wholly owned by the company and their revenue for the year ended december  represents approximately of the company s consolidated total revenue for the same period and their excluded assets represent approximately of the company s consolidated assets as of december  the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp  an independent registered public accounting firm  as stated in their report which appears herein 

table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and shareholders of dover corporation in our opinion  the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position of dover corporation and its subsidiaries at december  and  and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in addition  in our opinion  the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly  in all material respects  the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements 
also in our opinion  the company maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
the company management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule  for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  included in management report on internal control over financial reporting  appearing under item our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements  on the financial statement schedule  and on the company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits 
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audits of the financial statements included examining  on a test basis  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements  assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management  and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation 
our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk 
our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions 
a company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated description of business and summary of significant accounting policies description of business dover corporation the company is a diversified global manufacturer offering innovative equipment  components  and specialty systems 
the company also provides supporting engineering  testing  and other similar services  which are not significant in relation to consolidated revenue 
the company s businesses are based primarily in the united states of america and europe with manufacturing and other operations throughout the world 
the company operates through four business segments that are aligned with the key end markets they serve communication technologies  energy  engineered systems  and printing identification 
for additional information on the company s segments  see note principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the results of operations of purchased businesses are included from the dates of acquisitions 
as discussed in note  the company is reporting certain businesses that are held for sale at december  as discontinued operations 
the assets  liabilities  results of operations  and cash flows of all discontinued operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures 
these estimates may be adjusted due to changes in future economic  industry  or customer financial conditions  as well as changes in technology or demand 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other items  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  net realizable value of inventories  restructuring reserves  warranty reserves  pension and post retirement plans  stock based compensation  useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets  deferred tax assets  uncertain income tax positions  and contingencies 
actual results may ultimately differ from estimates  although management does not believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year 
estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period that they are determined 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  demand deposits  and short term investments which are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less 
short term investments short term investments consist of investment grade time deposits that have original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months  up to twelve months 
the company held no short term investments at december  or december  allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for estimated losses as a result of customers inability to make required payments 
management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances  the financial condition of its customers  historical trends  and the time outstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision 
inventories inventories for the majority of the company s subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventories are stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment includes the historic cost of land  buildings  equipment  and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment or  in the case of acquisitions  a fair market value appraisal of such assets completed at the time of acquisition 
property  plant and equipment also includes the cost of purchased software 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs  and minor renewals are expensed as incurred 
when property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings 
the company depreciates its assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows buildings and improvements to years  machinery and equipment to years  furniture and fixtures to years  vehicles years  and software to years 
depreciation expense totaled  in   in  and  in derivative instruments the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to various risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments 
table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated for speculative purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at inception of the contract 
the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value 
for derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities  the changes in fair value of both the derivatives and of the hedged items are recorded in current earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings and subsequently recognized in net earnings when the hedged items impact earnings 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives primarily trademarks are not amortized 
instead  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate or a current expectation of an impending disposal 
the company conducts its annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process 
for  the company identified reporting units for its annual goodwill impairment test 
step one of the test compares the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method to its book value 
this method uses the company s own market assumptions including projections of future cash flows  determinations of appropriate discount rates  and other assumptions which are considered reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis 
the projections are based on historical performance and future estimated results 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
step two  which compares the book value of the goodwill to its implied fair value  was not necessary since there were no indicators of potential impairment from step one 
see note for additional details on goodwill balances 
as discussed in note  in the fourth quarter of  in connection with impending sale of ect  the company tested the related goodwill for impairment  using internal valuation calculations validated by market based analysis of similar transactions  and recognized an after tax impairment loss of  within the results of discontinued operations 
the fair value of businesses held for sale at december  will continue to be evaluated at each subsequent reporting period until the time of sale  and further adjustments to fair value are possible if business conditions should change 
in  an after tax impairment loss of  was recorded within discontinued operations in connection with the sale of paladin brands 
similar to goodwill  in testing its other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  the company uses a discounted cash flow method to calculate and compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its book value 
this method uses the company s own market assumptions which are considered reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis 
any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 
no impairment of indefinite lived intangibles was indicated for the years ended december    or other intangible assets other intangible assets with determinable lives consist primarily of customer lists  unpatented technology  patents  and trademarks 
these other intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
long lived assets long lived assets including intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate 
if an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is produced and compared to its carrying value 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
foreign currency assets and liabilities of non us subsidiaries  where the functional currency is not the us dollar  have been translated at year end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly exchange rates 
foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss 
assets and liabilities of an entity that are denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are re measured into the functional currency using end of period exchange rates or historical rates where applicable to certain balances 
gains and losses related to these re measurements are recorded within the statement of earnings as a component of other expense income  net 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectability is reasonably assured  and d delivery has occurred or 
table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated services have been rendered 
the majority of the company s revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components  with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
service revenue represents less than of total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed 
in limited cases  revenue arrangements with customers require delivery  installation  testing  certification  or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized 
the company does not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements 
stock based compensation the principal awards issued under the company s stock based compensation plans include non qualified stock settled stock appreciation rights and performance share awards 
the cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
the value of the portion of the award that is expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense on a straight line basis  generally over the explicit service period of three years except for retirement eligible employees and retirees and is included in selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
expense for awards granted to retirement eligible employees is recorded over the period from the date of grant through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service 
see note for additional information related to the company s stock based compensation 
at the time of grant  the company estimates forfeitures  based on historical experience  in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest 
income taxes the provision for income taxes on continuing operations includes federal  state  local  and non us taxes 
tax credits  primarily for research and experimentation  non us earnings  and us manufacturer tax deduction are recognized as a reduction of the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in the year in which they are available for tax purposes 
deferred taxes are provided using enacted rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
temporary differences include the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefit of carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which realization is not assured 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all available evidence  including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback periods  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax regulations  interpretations and rulings  changes to enacted statutory tax rates  and changes to future taxable income estimates 
tax benefits are recognized from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents 
tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized on ultimate settlement 
the company has not provided for any residual us income taxes on unremitted earnings of non us subsidiaries as such earnings are currently intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated  and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 
research and development costs research and development costs  including qualifying engineering costs  are expensed when incurred and amounted to  in   in  and  in advertising advertising costs are expensed when incurred and amounted to  in   in  and  in risk  retention  insurance the company currently self insures its product and commercial general liability claims up to million per occurrence  its workers compensation claims up to million per occurrence  and automobile liability claims up to million per occurrence 
third party insurance provides primary level coverage in excess of these amounts up to certain specified limits 
in addition  the company has excess liability insurance from third party insurers on both an aggregate and an individual occurrence basis well in excess of the limits of the primary coverage 
a worldwide program of property insurance covers the company s owned and leased property and any business interruptions that may occur due to an insured hazard affecting those properties  subject to reasonable deductibles and aggregate limits 
the company s property and casualty insurance programs contain various deductibles that  based on the company s experience  are typical and customary for a company of its size and risk profile 
the company does not consider any of the deductibles to represent a material risk to the company 
the company generally maintains deductibles for claims and liabilities related primarily to workers compensation  health and welfare claims  general commercial  product and automobile liability and property damage  and business interruption resulting from certain events 
the company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated

reclassifications certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
the company adopted this guidance on january  and its adoption did not significantly impact the company consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this asu only requires a change in the format of the current presentation 
the company adopted this guidance for its year end reporting  presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings 
in september  the fasb issued asu which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test for goodwill impairment 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
this standard became effective for the company on january  its adoption did not impact the company consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer s participation in multiemployer pension plans 
the standard is intended to provide more information about an employer s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates 
this guidance became effective for the company for its fiscal year end reporting 
its adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinite lived intangible asset 
per the terms of this asu  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the entity determines  based on qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not  the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the revised standard is effective for dover for its annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the company does not expect adoption of this asu to significantly impact its consolidated financial statements

table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated financial instruments derivatives the company is exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of its operations 
in order to manage this risk the company has hedged portions of its forecasted sales and purchases  which occur within the next twelve months and are denominated in non functional currencies  with currency forward or collar contracts designated as cash flow hedges 
at december  and december   the company had contracts with us dollar equivalent notional amounts of  and  respectively  to exchange foreign currencies  principally the us dollar  euro  japanese yen  chinese yuan  and malaysian ringgit 
the company believes it is probable that all forecasted cash flow transactions will occur 
the company also has an outstanding floating to floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of  in exchange for chf  which expires on october  this transaction continues to hedge a portion of the company s net investment in chf denominated operations 
the agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and the effective portion of the change in fair value is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income 
the fair values at december  and december  reflected cumulative losses of  and  respectively  due to the strengthening of the swiss franc relative to the us dollar over the term of the arrangement

there are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and there are no credit risk related contingent features in the company s derivative instruments 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company  however  nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as the company s policy is to contract with highly rated  diversified counterparties 
fair value measurements accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
a financial instrument s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
asc establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs include inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of assets or liabilities 
level inputs are unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions

in addition to fair value disclosure requirements related to financial instruments carried at fair value  accounting standards require disclosures regarding the fair value of all of the company s financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of long term debt at december  and december  was  and  respectively  compared to the carrying value of  and  respectively 
the estimated fair value of long term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments and is  therefore  classified as level within the valuation hierarchy 
the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  accounts payable  and notes payable are reasonable estimates of their fair values as of december  and december  due to the short term nature of these instruments

unrecognized tax benefits the company files us  state  local  and foreign tax returns 
the company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions  and a number of audits are currently underway 
it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled  which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
this decrease may result in an income tax benefit 
due to the potential for resolution of federal  state  and foreign examinations  and the expiration of various statutes of limitation  the company gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to million 
some portion of any such change may be reported as discontinued operations

the plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year by year spot rates 
for post retirement benefit measurement purposes  an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits ie  health care cost trend rates was assumed for the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to by the year and remain at that level thereafter 
the health care cost trend rate assumption can have an effect on the amounts reported 
for example  increasing decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of december  by and  respectively  and would have a negligible impact on the net post retirement benefit cost for plan assets the primary financial objective of the plans is to secure participant retirement benefits 
accordingly  the key objective in the plans financial management is to promote stability and  to the extent appropriate  growth in the funded status 
related and supporting financial objectives are established in conjunction with a review of current and projected plan financial requirements 
as it relates to the funded defined benefit pension plans  the company s funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of the employment retirement income security act erisa and applicable international laws 
the company is responsible for overseeing the management of the investments of the plans assets and otherwise ensuring that the plans investment programs are in compliance with erisa  other relevant legislation  and related plan documents 
where relevant  the company has retained professional investment managers to manage the plans assets and implement the investment process 
the investment managers  in implementing their investment processes  have the authority and responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset classes specified by the terms of their applicable prospectus or investment manager agreements with the plans 
the assets of the plans are invested to achieve an appropriate return for the plans consistent with a prudent level of risk 
the asset return objective is to achieve  as a minimum over time  the passively managed return earned by market index funds  weighted in the proportions outlined by the asset class exposures identified in the plans strategic allocation 
the expected return on assets assumption used for pension expense is developed through analysis of historical market returns  statistical analysis  current market conditions  and the past experience of plan asset investments 
overall  it is projected that the investment of plan assets within dover s us corporate pension plan will achieve a net return over time from the asset allocation strategy

common stock funds consist of mutual funds and collective trusts 
mutual funds are valued by obtaining quoted prices from nationally recognized securities exchanges 
collective trusts are valued using net asset value the nav as of the last business day of the year 
the nav is based on the underlying value of the assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities  and then divided by the number of shares outstanding 
the value of the underlying assets is based on quoted prices in active markets 
the real estate funds are valued on an annual basis using third party appraisals  with adjustments estimated on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flow models which consider such inputs as revenue and expense growth rates  terminal capitalization rates  and discount rates 
the company believes this is an appropriate methodology to obtain the fair value of these assets 
the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values 
furthermore  while the company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date

changes in internal controls during the fourth quarter of  there were no changes in the company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  the company s internal control over financial reporting 
inherent limitations over internal controls the company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company s assets  ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that the company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company s management and directors  and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
management s report on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting is included in item of this form k 
management  including the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that the company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
also  any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate
