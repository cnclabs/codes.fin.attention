table of contents part i item description of business business overview lannett company  inc and subsidiaries the company  lannett  we  or us was incorporated in under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  and reincorporated in as a delaware corporation 
we develop  manufacture  market and distribute generic versions of brand pharmaceutical products 
we report financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis with the most recent being the fiscal year ended june  all references herein to a fiscal year or fiscal refer to the applicable fiscal year ended june the company has experienced net sales growth at a compounded annual growth rate in excess of over the past twelve years 
in that time period net sales went from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year this growth has been achieved primarily through strategic partnerships and launches of additional manufactured drugs as well as opportunities resulting from our strong historical record of regulatory compliance 
all products that we currently manufacture and or distribute are prescription products 
of the products listed in the table entitled current products below  our top five products collectively accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal years  and competitive strengths vertically integrated manufacturer  supplier and distributor of narcotics and controlled drugs 
in july  the us drug enforcement administration dea granted cody laboratories  inc cody labs a license to directly import concentrated poppy straw for conversion into opioid based active pharmaceutical ingredients apis for use in various dosage forms for pain management 
this license  along with cody labs expertise in api development and manufacture allows the company to perform in a market with high barriers to entry  no foreign competition  and limited domestic competition 
because of this vertical integration  the company has direct control of its supply and can avoid increased costs associated with buying apis from third party manufacturers  thereby achieving higher margins 
proven ability to develop successful products and achieve scale in production 
we believe that our ability to select viable products for development  efficiently develop such products  including obtaining any applicable regulatory approvals  vertically integrate into certain markets and achieve economies of scale in production are critical for our success in the generic pharmaceutical industry in which we operate 
we intend to focus on long term profitability driven in part by securing market positions with less competition 
efficient development systems and manufacturing expertise for new products 
we believe that our manufacturing expertise  low overhead expenses  efficient product development  and marketing capabilities can help us remain competitive in the generic pharmaceutical market 
we intend to dedicate significant capital toward developing new products because we believe our success is linked to our ability to continually introduce new generic products into the marketplace 
competition from new and other market participants for the manufacture and distribution of certain products would likely affect our market share with respect to such products as well as force us to reduce our selling price for such products due to their increased availability 
as a result  we believe that our success depends on our ability to properly assess the competitive market of new products  including market share  the number of competitors and the generic unit price erosion 
we intend to reduce our exposure to competitive influences that may negatively affect our sales and profits  including the potential saturation of the market for certain products  by continuing to emphasize maintenance of a strong research and development r d pipeline 
mutually beneficial supply and distribution arrangements 
in  we entered into an exclusive ten year distribution agreement the jsp distribution agreement with jerome stevens pharmaceuticals jsp covering four different product lines 
two of these product lines  levothyroxine sodium and digoxin  collectively accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal year and both products have experienced significant market growth in sales over the past few years 
on august  the company reached an agreement with jsp to extend the term of the initial agreement 
refer to note subsequent events for more information 

table of contents dependable supplier to our customers 
we believe we are viewed within the generic pharmaceutical industry as a strong  dependable supplier 
we have cultivated strong and dependable customer relationships by maintaining adequate inventory levels  employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders 
a majority of our orders are filled and shipped either on the day that we receive the order  or the following day 
strong track record of obtaining regulatory approvals for new products 
during the past two fiscal years  we have received eight approved abbreviated new drug applications each  an anda and one approved anda supplement from the food and drug administration the fda 
we currently expect to receive several more during the next fiscal year 
these regulatory approvals will enable us to manufacture and supply a broader portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products 
reputation for regulatory compliance 
we have a strong track record of regulatory compliance 
we believe that we have strong effective regulatory compliance capabilities and practices which result from the hiring of qualified individuals and the implementation of strong current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
our agility in responding quickly to market events and a reputation for regulatory compliance position us to avail ourselves of market opportunities as they are presented to us 
in addition  narcotics which are classified by the dea as controlled drugs are subject to a rigorous regulatory compliance regimen 
we are one of seven companies in the us that have been granted a license from the dea to import raw concentrated poppy straw for conversion into apis 
such licenses are renewed annually  and non compliance could result in a license not being renewed 
as a result  we believe that our strong reputation for regulatory compliance allows us to have a competitive edge in managing the production and distribution of controlled drugs 
business strategies continue to broaden our product lines through internal development and strategic partnerships 
we are focused on increasing our market share in the generic pharmaceutical industry while concentrating additional resources on the development of new products  with an emphasis on controlled substance products 
we continue to improve our financial performance by expanding our line of generic products  increasing unit sales to current customers  creating manufacturing efficiencies  and managing our overhead and administrative costs 
we have targeted four strategies for expanding our product offerings deploying our experienced r d staff to develop products in house  entering into product development agreements or strategic partnerships with third party product developers and formulators  purchasing andas from other generic manufacturers and marketing drugs under brand names 
we expect that each method will facilitate our identification  selection and development of additional generic pharmaceutical products that we may distribute through our existing network of customers 
we have several existing supply and development agreements with both international and domestic companies  and are currently in negotiations on similar agreements with additional companies  through which we can market and distribute future products 
we intend to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to build our market share for such products 
improve our operating profile in certain targeted specialty markets 
in certain situations  we may increase our focus on particular specialty markets within the generic pharmaceutical industry 
by narrowing our focus to specialty markets  we can provide product alternatives in categories with relatively fewer market participants 
we plan to strengthen our relationships with strategic partners  including providers of product development research  raw materials  apis and finished products 
we believe that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas  including potential financing arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or acquisitions  could enhance our competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market 
leverage ability to vertically integrate as a manufacturer  supplier and distributor of controlled substance products 
one initiative that is at the core of the company s strategy is to continue leveraging the asset we acquired in cody labs in in july  the dea granted cody labs a license to directly import concentrated poppy straw for conversion into opioid based apis for use in various dosage forms for pain management 
the value of this license comes from the fact that  to date  only six other companies in the us have been granted this license 
this license  along with cody labs expertise in api development and manufacture  allows the company to perform in a market with high barriers to entry  no foreign competition  and limited domestic competition 
because of this vertical integration  the company has direct control of its supply and can avoid increased costs associated with buying apis from third party manufacturers  thereby achieving higher margins 
the company can also leverage this vertical integration not only for direct supply of opioid based apis  but also for the manufacture non opioid based apis 

table of contents the company believes that the demand for controlled substance  pain management drugs will continue to grow as the baby boomer generation ages 
by concentrating additional resources in the development of opioid based apis and dosage forms  the company is well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity 
the company is currently vertically integrated on two products with several others in various stages of development 
key products levothyroxine sodium tablets are produced and marketed with varying potencies 
in addition to generic levothyroxine sodium tablets  we also market and distribute unithroid tablets  a brand version of levothyroxine sodium tablets  which is produced and marketed with varying potencies 
both generic levothyroxine sodium and unithroid tablets are manufactured by jsp 
levothyoxine sodium tablets remain one of the most prescribed drugs in the us and are used by patients of various ages and demographic backgrounds for the treatment of thyroid deficiency 
net sales of levothyroxine sodium and unithroid tablets totaled million in in our distribution of these products  we compete with two brand levothroxine sodium products abbott laboratories synthroid and monarch pharmaceutical s levoxyl as well as generic products from mylan and sandoz 
digoxin tablets are produced and marketed with two different potencies 
this product is manufactured by jsp and we distribute it under the jsp distribution agreement 
digoxin tablets are used to treat congestive heart failure in patients of various ages and demographics 
net sales of this product totaled million in in our distribution of these products  we compete with two similar generic products from impax and west ward and the brand lanoxin from covis 
we distribute three products containing butalbital 
we have manufactured and sold one of the products  butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules  for more than years 
the other butalbital product  butalbital with aspirin  caffeine and codeine phosphate capsules  is manufactured by jsp and distributed under the jsp distribution agreement 
both butalbital products  which are in orally administered capsule dosage forms  are prescribed to treat migraines and tension headaches caused by contractions of the muscles in the neck and shoulder area 
the drug is prescribed primarily for adults of various demographics 
migraines are an increasingly prevalent condition in the united states and we believe the demand for effective medical treatments will continue to increase 
although new innovator drugs to treat migraines have been introduced by brand name drug companies  we believe that there is still a loyal following of doctors and consumers who prefer to use butalbital products for treatment 
cocaine topical solution c topical is produced and marketed under a preliminary new drug application pind in two different strengths and two different size containers 
sales of c topical approximated of lannett s net sales during fiscal this drug is utilized primarily for the anesthetization of the patient during ear  nose or throat surgery 
morphine sulfate oral solution is produced and marketed in three different size containers 
we manufacture this product at cody labs and are currently finishing the manufacturing methods and capabilities to make the api 
this drug is prescribed primarily for the management of pain in adults where other products or delivery methods are not tolerable 
as recently as march  nine different companies  including lannett  were manufacturing and or distributing this product 
as a result of enforcement actions by the fda during fiscal years and see item government regulation  six of those companies  including lannett  voluntarily left the market by july from july through june  only one company had an approved nda for this product and enjoyed market exclusivity until lannett became the second approved manufacturer of this product in june and resumed sales of this product during the first fiscal quarter of oxycodone hcl oral solution oxycodone was produced until august  and marketed until october  in two different size containers  at which point  as a result of fda enforcement actions against market participants  the company voluntarily exited the market 
prior to the enforcement actions the company had submitted an anda to the fda 
the company was granted expedited review for this application 
the company expects to receive approval and resume selling oxycodone in the near future 
once approval is granted we will resume manufacture of these solution dosage forms at our cody labs subsidiary 
validated pharmaceutical capabilities our  square foot manufacturing facility sits on acres of company owned land 
in addition  we own a  square foot building residing on acres of company owned land 
this facility is located within one mile of our manufacturing facility 
the facility houses packaging  research and development  and has capacity for additional manufacturing space  if needed 
we also own a  square foot building on acres of land  which is used for certain administrative functions  warehouse space and shipping 
it also has capacity for additional manufacturing space  if needed 
all three of these buildings are located in philadelphia  pennsylvania 

table of contents the manufacturing facility of our wholly owned subsidiary  cody labs  consists of an approximately  square foot facility located on approximately acres of land in cody  wyoming 
cody labs leases the facility from cody lci realty  llc realty  which is owned by lannett and by a former officer of cody labs 
cody labs manufacturing facility currently has capacity for further expansion  both inside and outside the existing structure 
we have adopted many new processes in support of regulations relating to cgmps in the last several years  and we believe we are operating our facilities in substantial compliance with the fda s cgmp regulations 
in designing our facilities  full attention was given to material flow  equipment and automation  quality control and inspection 
a granulator  an automatic film coating machine  high speed tablet presses  blenders  encapsulators  fluid bed dryers  high shear mixers  and high speed bottle filling are a few examples of the sophisticated product development  manufacturing and packaging equipment used in the production process 
in addition  our quality control laboratory facilities are equipped with high precision instruments  such as automated liquid chromatographs  gas chromatographs  and laser particle size analyzers 
we continue to pursue the fda s comprehensive plan entitled quality by design for improving and maintaining quality control and quality assurance programs in our pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facilities 
the fda periodically inspects our production facilities to determine our compliance with the fda s manufacturing standards 
typically  after completing its inspection  the fda will issue a report  entitled a form  containing observations arising from an inspection 
the fda s observations may be minor or severe in nature and the degree of severity is generally determined by the time necessary to remediate the cgmp violation  any consequences to the consumer of the products  and whether the observation is subject to a warning letter from the fda 
by strictly complying with cgmps and the various fda guidelines  and good laboratory practices glps  as well as adherence to our standard operating procedures  we have successfully minimized the number of observations in our fda inspections in recent years  and in more than years of business have never received a warning letter 
research and development process over the past several years  we have heavily invested in r d projects 
the costs of these r d efforts are expensed during the periods incurred 
we believe that such costs may be recovered in future years when we receive marketing approval from the fda to distribute such products 
we have embarked on a plan to grow in future years  which includes organic growth to be achieved through our r d efforts 
we expect that our growing list of generic products under development will drive future growth 
over the past several years  we have hired additional personnel in product development  production  and formulation 
the following steps outline the numerous stages in the generic drug development process formulation and analytical method development 
after a drug candidate is selected for future sale  product development scientists perform various experiments on the incorporation of active ingredients into a dosage form 
these experiments will result in the creation of a number of product formulations to determine which formula will be most suitable for our subsequent development process 
various formulations are tested in the laboratory to measure results against the innovator drug 
during this time  we may use reverse engineering methods on samples of the innovator drug to determine the type and quantity of inactive ingredients 
during the formulation phase  our r d chemists begin to develop an analytical  laboratory testing method 
the successful development of this test method will allow us to test developmental and commercial batches of the product in the future 
all of the information used in the final formulation  including the analytical test methods adopted for the generic drug candidate  will be included as part of the chemistry  manufacturing and controls section of the anda submitted to the fda 
scale up and tech transfer 
after product development scientists and the r d chemists agree on a final formulation for use in moving the drug candidate forward in the developmental process  we then attempt to increase the batch size of the product 
the batch size represents the standard magnitude to be used in manufacturing a batch of the product 
the determination of batch size affects the amount of raw material that is used in the manufacturing process and the number of expected dosages to be created during the production cycle 
we attempt to determine batch size based on the amount of active ingredient in each dosage  the available production equipment and unit sales projections 
the scaled up batch is then generally produced in our commercial manufacturing facilities 
during this manufacturing process  we document the equipment used  the amount of time in each major processing step and any other steps needed to consistently produce a batch of that product 
this information  generally referred to as the validated manufacturing process  is included in the anda 
bioequivalency and clinical testing 
after a successful scale up of the generic drug batch  we schedule and perform bioequivalency testing on the product  and in some cases clinical testing if required by the fda 
these procedures  which are generally outsourced to third parties  include testing the absorption of the generic product in the human bloodstream compared to the absorption of the innovator drug 
the results of this testing are then documented and reported to us to determine the success of the generic drug product 
success  in this context  means that we are able to demonstrate that our product is comparable to the innovator product in dosage form  strength  route of administration  quality  performance characteristics and intended use 

table of contents since bioequivalence meaning that the product performs in the same manner and in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and a stable formula are the primary requirements for a generic drug approval assuming the manufacturing plant is in compliance with the fda s cgmp regulations 
lengthy and costly clinical trials proving safety and efficacy  which are required by the fda for innovator drug approvals  are typically unnecessary for generic companies 
if the results are successful  we will continue the collection of information and documentation for assembly of the drug application 
submission of the anda for fda review and approval 
the anda process became formalized under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  also known as the hatch waxman act hatch waxman act 
the hatch waxman act amended the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdca to permit the fda to review and approve an anda for a generic equivalent of a new drug product  which previously received fda approval through its new drug approval process  without having the generic drug company conduct costly clinical trials 
an anda is a comprehensive submission that contains  among other things  data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient  drug product formulation  specifications and stability of the generic drug  as well as analytical methods  manufacturing process validation data  and quality control procedures 
according to information obtained from the fda  the current fda median review time for andas is months 
while we have received approval for some of our andas in as little as months  we have also waited longer than months before receiving approval 
subsequently  the fda advised that electronic submissions of applications may shorten the approval process 
we currently file our andas and ndas electronically 
on july  the food and drug administration safety and innovation act was enacted  which included the generic drug user fee amendments of gdufa 
under these amendments the fda committed to reviewing of complete electronic generic applications within months after the date of submission 
andas and ndas submitted for our products may not receive fda approval on a timely basis  or at all 
when a generic drug company files an anda with the fda  they must certify either i that no patent was filed for the listed drug a paragraph i certification  ii that the patent has expired a paragraph ii certification  iii that the patent will expire on a specified date and the anda filer will not market the drug until that date a paragraph iii certification  or iv that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture  use  or sale of the new drug a paragraph iv certification 
a paragraph iv certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved nda to which the anda refers 
a paragraph iv certification can trigger an automatic month stay of the anda if the innovator company files a claim which would delay the approval of the generic company s anda 
to date  we have filed one paragraph iv certification 
sales and customer relationships we sell our pharmaceutical products to generic pharmaceutical distributors  drug wholesalers  chain drug retailers  private label distributors  mail order pharmacies  other pharmaceutical manufacturers  managed care organizations  hospital buying groups  governmental entities and health maintenance organizations 
we promote our products through direct sales  trade shows  and bids 
we continue to expand our sales to major chain drug stores 
our practice of maintaining an adequate inventory  employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders have contributed to a strong reputation among our customers as a dependable supplier of high quality generic pharmaceuticals 
management we have been focused on enhancing the quality of our management team in anticipation of continuing growth 
we have hired experienced personnel from large  established  brand pharmaceutical companies as well as competing generic companies to complement the skills and knowledge of the existing management team 
as we continue to grow  additional personnel may need to be added to our management team 
we intend to hire the best people available to expand the knowledge base and expertise within our personnel ranks

according to ims  for the year ended july total sales of butalbital  acetaminophen and caffeine tablets at awp were approximately million  of which about million was for the brand version  fioricet 
we have additional products currently under development which are orally administered solid dosage products ie tablet capsule or oral solutions  topicals or parentarels designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
our developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  clinical testing and fda review 
the cost associated with each product that we are currently developing is dependent on numerous factors  including but not limited to  the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the price of the raw materials and the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies depending on the fda s orange book classification 
the cost to develop a new generic product varies but could range up to several million dollars 
in addition  we currently own several andas that are dormant for products which we currently do not manufacture and market 
occasionally  we review such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed to make it attractive for us to reconsider manufacturing and selling 
if we decide to introduce one of these products into the consumer market  we must review the original anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of the applicable drug 
generally  in these situations  we file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  the raw material supplier or another major feature of the previously approved anda 
we would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for an anda supplement is similar to that of a new anda 
in addition to the efforts of our internal product development group  we have contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development  and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products include orally administered solid dosage products  injectables and nasal delivery products that are intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
we intend to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for some of these r d products to our own commercial manufacturing sites 
we initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of our own internal r d efforts 
the majority of our r d projects are being developed in house and thus our contracts with third parties for product development are not material in nature  nor are we substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 

table of contents the following table summarizes key information related to our r d products 
the column headings are defined as follows stage of r d defines the current stage of the r d product in the development process  as of the date of this form k 
regulatory requirement defines whether the r d product is or is expected to be a new anda submission  an anda supplement 
number of products defines the number of products in r d at the stage noted 
in this context  a product means any finished dosage form  including all potencies  containing the same api or combination of apis and which represents a generic version of the same reference listed drug rld or innovator drug  identified in the fda s orange book

while we manage all r d from our principal executive office in philadelphia  pennsylvania  we have also been taking steps to capitalize on favorable development costs in other countries 
we have strategic partnerships with various companies that either act as contract research organizations or api suppliers as well as dosage form manufacturers 
in addition  us based research organizations have been engaged for product development to enhance our internal development 
fixed payment arrangements are established between lannett and these development partners and in some cases include a royalty provision 
development payments are normally scheduled in advance  based on attaining development milestones 
raw materials and finished goods suppliers our use of raw materials in the production process consists of using pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms that are generally available from several sources 
fda approval is required in connection with the process of using active ingredient suppliers 
in addition to the raw materials we purchase for the production process  we purchase certain finished dosage inventories 
we sell these finished dosage form products directly to our customers along with the finished dosage form products manufactured in house 
we generally take precautionary measures to avoid a disruption in raw materials and finished goods  such as finding secondary suppliers for certain raw materials or finished goods when available 
our primary finished goods supplier is jsp in bohemia  new york 
purchases of finished goods from jsp accounted for approximately of our inventory purchases in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year on march   we entered into the jsp distribution agreement for the exclusive distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products 
the products covered under the jsp distribution agreement include butalbital  aspirin  caffeine with codeine phosphate capsules  digoxin tablets and levothyroxine sodium tablets  sold generically and under the brand name unithroid 
the initial term of the jsp distribution agreement is ten years  beginning on march  and continuing through march  see note material contracts with suppliers and note subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the terms  conditions and financial impact of the jsp distribution agreement and subsequent amendment 
during the term of the jsp distribution agreement  we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase minimum dollar quantities of jsp s products that we distribute 
the minimum quantity to be purchased in the first year of the jsp distribution agreement was million 
thereafter  the minimum purchase quantity increases by million per year up to million for the last year of the jsp distribution agreement 
we have met each applicable minimum purchase requirement to date  but there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to do so in fiscal if we do not meet the minimum purchase requirements  jsp s sole remedy is to terminate the jsp distribution agreement 
on august  the company reached an agreement with jsp to extend the term of the initial agreement 
refer to note subsequent events for more information 

table of contents we have entered into definitive supply and development agreements with international companies  including  azad pharma ag  swiss caps of switzerland  and pharma b formerly pharmaseed and the gc group of israel  as well as domestic companies  including jsp  cerovene  and summit bioscience llc 
we are currently in negotiations on similar agreements with other companies  through which we will market and distribute future products manufactured in house or by third parties 
we intend to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to build market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
customers and marketing we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors  generic drug distributors  mail order pharmacies  group purchasing organizations  chain drug stores and other pharmaceutical companies 
the pharmaceutical industry s largest wholesale distributors  amerisource bergen  cardinal health  and mckesson  accounted for   and  respectively  of our net sales in fiscal year and  and  respectively  of our net sales in fiscal year our largest chain drug store customer  walgreens  accounted for and of net sales in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  and have experienced no significant collection problems to date 
generally  we require no collateral from our customers 
sales to wholesale customers include indirect sales  which represent sales to third party entities  such as independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
we enter into definitive agreements with our indirect customers to establish pricing for certain covered products 
under such agreements  the indirect customers independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
we will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
this credit is called a chargeback 
for more information on chargebacks  see the section entitled critical accounting policies in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
these indirect sale transactions are recorded on our books as sales to wholesale customers 
we promote our products through direct sales  trade shows and group purchasing organizations bidding processes 
we also market our products through private label arrangements  under which we manufacture our products with a label containing the name and logo of our customer 
this practice is commonly referred to as private label business 
private label business allows us to leverage our internal sales efforts by using the marketing services from other well respected pharmaceutical suppliers 
the focus of our sales efforts is the relationships we create with our customer accounts 
strong and dependable customer relationships have created a positive platform for us to increase our sales volumes 
historically and in fiscal years  and  our advertising expenses were immaterial 
when our sales representatives make contact with a customer  we will generally offer to supply the customer our products at fixed prices 
if accepted  the customer s purchasing department will coordinate the purchase  receipt and distribution of the products throughout its distribution centers and retail outlets 
once a customer accepts our supply of a product  the customer typically expects a high standard of service  including timely receipt of products ordered  availability of convenient  user friendly and effective customer service functions and maintaining open lines of communication 
we believe that retail level consumer demand dictates the total volume of sales for various products 
in the event that wholesale and retail customers adjust their purchasing volumes  we believe that consumer demand will be fulfilled by other wholesale or retail sources of supply 
as a result  we attempt to develop and maintain strong relationships with most of the major retail chains  wholesale distributors and mail order pharmacies in order to facilitate the supply of our products through whatever channel the consumer prefers 
although we have agreements with customers governing the transaction terms of our sales  generally there are no minimum purchase quantities applicable to these agreements 
competition the manufacturing and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry 
competition is based primarily on price 
in addition to competitive pricing our competitive advantages are our ability to provide strong and dependable customer service by maintaining adequate inventory levels  employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of orders 
we ensure that our products are available from national suppliers as well as our own warehouse 
the modernization of our facilities  hiring of experienced staff and implementation of inventory and quality control programs have improved our competitive cost position over the past five years 

table of contents we compete with other manufacturers and marketers of generic and brand name drugs 
each product manufactured and or sold by us has a different set of competitors 
the list below identifies the companies with which we primarily compete with respect to each of our major products 
product primary competitors butalbital  acetaminophen and caffeine tablets mallinckrodt  mikart  mirror  qualitest and watson butalbital with aspirin and caffeine  with and without codeine phosphate capsules watson and breckenridge c topical solution alternative products to meet the need digoxin tablets covis  impax  and west ward doxycycline hyclate and monohydrate tablets par  mylan  sandoz and ranbaxy hydromorphone hcl tablets mallinckrodt  roxane and purdue levothyroxine sodium tablets abbott  monarch  mylan and sandoz morphine sulfate oral solution roxane and mallinckrodt primidone tablets watson  qualitest and amneal rifampin capsules sandoz and versapharm triamterene w hydrochlorothiazide capsules gsk  sandoz and mylan unithroid tablets abbott  monarch  mylan and sandoz ursodiol capsules epic  mylan and watson government regulation pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government  principally by the fda  and  in cases of controlled substance products the dea  and to a lesser extent by other federal regulatory bodies and state governments 
the fdca  the controlled substance act the csa and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  pricing  advertising  and promotion of our generic drug products 
noncompliance with applicable regulations can result in fines  product recalls  and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  personal and or corporate prosecution and debarment  and refusal of the government to approve new drug applications 
the fda also has the authority to revoke previously approved drug applications 
generally  fda approval is required before a prescription drug can be marketed 
a new drug is one not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use 
new drugs are typically developed and submitted to the fda by companies expecting to brand the product and sell it 
the fda review process for new drugs is very extensive and requires a substantial investment to research and test the drug candidate 
however  less burdensome approval procedures are generally used for generic equivalents 
typically  the investment required to develop a generic drug is less costly than the innovator drug 

table of contents there are currently three ways to obtain fda approval of a drug new drug applications nda unless one of the two procedures discussed in the following sections is available  a manufacturer must conduct and submit to the fda complete clinical studies to establish a drug s safety and efficacy 
the new drug approval process generally involves completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with the fda s glp regulations  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug ind application for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use  satisfactory completion of an fda pre approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with the fda s cgmp regulations  and submission to and approval by the fda of an nda 
the results of preclinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
further  each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
these phases generally include phase i  during which the drug is introduced into healthy human subjects or  on occasion  patients and is tested for safety  stability  dose tolerance  and metabolism  phase ii  during which the drug is introduced into a limited patient population to determine the efficacy of the product in specific targeted indications  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  and phase iii  during which the clinical trial is expanded to a larger and more diverse patient group at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate clinical efficacy  optimal dosage  and safety 
the drug sponsor  the fda  or the independent institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of preclinical animal studies and human clinical studies  together with other detailed information  are submitted to the fda as part of the nda 
the nda also must contain extensive manufacturing information 
the fda may disapprove the nda if applicable fda regulatory criteria are not satisfied or it may require additional clinical data 
once approved  the fda may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre and post market regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur or are identified after the product reaches the marketplace 
in addition  the fda may require post marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post marketing studies 
the fda has broad post market regulatory and enforcement powers  including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties  suspend or delay issuance of approvals  seize or recall products  and withdraw approvals 
satisfaction of fda new drug approval requirements typically takes several years  and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity  and novelty of the product or disease 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and or require additional procedures which increase manufacturing costs 
success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be subject to varying interpretations that could delay  limit  or prevent regulatory approval 
even if a product receives regulatory approval  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 

table of contents abbreviated new drug applications anda an anda is similar to an nda except that the fda generally waives the requirement of complete clinical studies of safety and efficacy 
however  it may require bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the bloodstream needed to produce a therapeutic effect 
bioequivalence compares one drug product with another and indicates if the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body are within prescribed statistical limits to those of a previously approved drug 
under the hatch waxman act  an anda may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of an approved drug regardless of when such other drug was approved 
the fda will approve the generic product as suitable for an anda application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product 
a product is not eligible for anda approval if the fda determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug  if it is intended for a different use  or if it is not subject to an approved suitability petition 
however  such a product might be approved under an nda  with supportive data from clinical trials 
in addition to establishing a new anda procedure  the hatch waxman act created statutory protections for approved brand name drugs 
under the hatch waxman act  an anda for a generic drug may not be made effective until all relevant product and use patents for the brand name drug have expired or have been determined to be invalid 
prior to this act  the fda gave no consideration to the patent status of a previously approved drug 
upon nda approval  the fda lists in its orange book the approved drug product and any patents identified by the nda applicant that relate to the drug product 
any applicant who files an anda seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the fda s orange book before expiration of the referenced patent s  must certify to the fda that no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the anda has been submitted to the fda  such patent has expired  the date on which such patent expires  or such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture  use  or sale of the drug product for which the anda is submitted 
this last certification is known as a paragraph iv certification 
a notice of the paragraph iv certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved nda to which the anda refers 
before the enactment of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the mma  which amended the hatch waxman act  if the nda holder or patent owner s asserted a patent challenge within days of its receipt of the certification notice  the fda was prevented from approving that anda until the earlier of months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph iv certification  the expiration of the patent  when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in an anda applicant s favor  or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court 
this prohibition is generally referred to as the month stay 
in some cases  nda owners and patent holders have obtained additional patents for their products after an anda had been filed but before that anda received final marketing approval  and then initiated a new patent challenge  which resulted in more than one month stay 
the mma amended the hatch waxman act to eliminate certain unfair advantages of patent holders in the implementation of the hatch waxman act 
as a result  the nda owner remains entitled to an automatic month stay if it initiates a patent infringement lawsuit within days of its receipt of notice of a paragraph iv certification  but only if the patent infringement lawsuit is directed to patents that were listed in the fda s orange book before the anda was filed 
an anda applicant is now permitted to take legal action to enjoin or prohibit the listing of certain of these patents as a counterclaim in response to a claim by the nda owner that its patent covers its approved drug product 
if an anda applicant is the first to file a substantially complete anda with a paragraph iv certification and provides appropriate notice to the fda  the nda holder  and all patent owner s for a particular generic product  the applicant may be awarded a day period of marketing exclusivity against other companies that subsequently file andas for that same product 
a substantially complete anda is one that contains all the information required by the hatch waxman act and the fda s regulations  including the results of any required bioequivalence studies 
the fda may refuse to accept the filing of an anda that is not substantially complete or may determine during substantive review of the anda that additional information  such as an additional bioequivalence study  is required to support approval 
such a determination may affect an applicant s first to file status and eligibility for a day period of marketing exclusivity for the generic product 
the mma also modified the rules governing when the day marketing exclusivity period is triggered or forfeited and shared 
prior to the legislation  the day marketing exclusivity period was triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the anda or a court decision holding the patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
for andas accepted for filing before march  that court decision had to be final and non appealable other than a petition to the us supreme court for a writ of certiorari 
in march  the fda changed its position in response to two court cases that challenged the fda s original interpretation of what constituted a court decision under the hatch waxman act 
under the changed policy  the day marketing exclusivity period began running immediately upon a district court decision holding the patent at issue invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed  regardless of whether the anda had been approved and the generic product had been marketed 
in codifying the fda s original policy  the mma retroactively applies a final and non appealable court decision trigger for all andas filed before december  leaving intact the first commercial marketing trigger 
as for andas filed after december   the marketing exclusivity period is only triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the anda product  but that exclusivity may be forfeited under certain circumstances  including  if the anda is not marketed within days after a final and non appealable court decision by the first to file or other anda applicant  or if the fda does not tentatively approve the first to file applicant s anda within months 

table of contents in addition to patent exclusivity  the holder of the nda for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non patent market exclusivity  during which the fda cannot approve an anda 
if the listed drug is a new chemical entity nce  the fda may not accept an anda for a bioequivalent product for up to five years following approval of the nda for the nce 
if the listed drug is not a new chemical entity but the holder of the nda conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the nda or a supplement thereto  the fda may not approve an anda for a bioequivalent product before expiration of three years 
certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the listed drug is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or is studied for pediatric indications 
section b new drug applications for a drug that is identical to a previously approved drug  a prospective manufacturer need not go through the full nda procedure 
instead  it may demonstrate safety and efficacy by relying on published literature and reports where at least some of information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
the hatch waxman act permits the applicant to rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product 
the manufacturer must also submit  if the fda so requires  bioavailability or bioequivalence data illustrating that the generic drug formulation produces the same effects  within an acceptable range  as the previously approved innovator drug 
because published literature to support the safety and efficacy of post drugs may not be available  this procedure is of limited utility to generic drug manufacturers and the resulting approved product will not be interchangeable with the innovator drug as an anda drug would be unless bioequivalency testing were undertaken and approved by fda 
moreover  the utility of section b applications have with the exception of grandfathered drugs been diminished by the availability of the anda process  as described above 
additionally  certain products  marketed prior to the fdca may be considered grase generally recognized as safe and effective or grandfathered 
grase products are those old drugs that do not require prior approval from fda in order to be marketed because they are generally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature 
similarly  grandfathered products are those which entered the market before the passage of the act or the amendments to the act 
under the grandfather clause  such a product is exempted from the effectiveness requirements 
of the act 
if its composition and labeling have not changed since and if  on the day before the amendments became effective  it was used or sold commercially in the united states  not a new drug as defined by the act at that time  and not covered by an effective application 
please see additional discussion regarding grase and grandfathered products in item a 
risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing cgmp requirements among the requirements for a new drug approval  a company s manufacturing methods must conform to fda cgmp regulations before a facility may be used to manufacture a product 
the fda performs pre approval inspections to assess a company s manufacturing methods as part of a new drug approval process 
these inspections include reviews of procedures and operations used in the manufacture and testing of our products to assess compliance with application regulations 
the cgmp regulations must be followed at all times during which the approved drug is manufactured and the manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other authorities 
fda s cgmp regulations require among other things  quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
in complying with the standards set forth in the cgmp regulations  we must continue to expend time  money  and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 
failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  including but not limited to  the seizure or recall of non complying drug products  injunctions  consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations  and or civil and criminal penalties 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal 
product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval 

table of contents other regulatory requirements with respect to post market product advertising and promotion  the fda imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals  which include  among others  standards for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the fdca  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from fda standards  a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre cleared by the fda  and state and or federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices  the experimental use of animals  and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research 
in each of these areas  as above  the fda has broad regulatory and enforcement powers  including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties  suspend or delay issuance of approvals  seize or recall products  and withdraw approvals 
any one or a combination of fda regulatory or enforcement actions against the company could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
dea regulation we maintain registrations with the dea that enable us to receive  manufacture  store  and distribute controlled substances in connection with our operations 
controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the dea under the csa 
the csa governs  among other things  the distribution  recordkeeping  handling  security  and disposal of controlled substances 
we are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the dea and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess our ongoing compliance with the dea s regulations 
any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions  including the revocation or a denial of renewal of our dea registration  injunctions  or civil or criminal penalties 
fraud and abuse laws because of the significant federal funding involved in medicare and medicaid  congress and state legislatures have enacted  and actively enforce  a number of laws whose purpose is to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal health care programs 
our business is subject to compliance with these laws  such as sarbanes oxley act of  dodd frank  and the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
anti kickback statutes  sunshine act  and federal false claims act the federal health care programs fraud and abuse law sometimes referred to as the anti kickback statue prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  offering  receiving  or providing remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual  or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service  for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid 
the definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value  including for example gifts  certain discounts  the furnishing of free supplies  equipment or services  credit arrangements  payment of cash and waivers of payments 
several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business  the statute has been violated 
penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines  imprisonment  and possible exclusion from medicare  medicaid  and other federal health care programs 
in addition some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the federal false claims act  discussed in more detail below 
the anti kickback statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry 
recognizing that the anti kickback statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements  congress authorized the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services oig to issue a series of regulations  known as safe harbors 
these safe harbors  issued by the oig beginning in july  set forth provisions that  if all their applicable requirements are met  will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the anti kickback statute 
the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued 
however  conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as oig 
many states have adopted laws similar to the anti kickback statute 
some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source  not only the medicare and medicaid programs 
government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of health care services and products  among other activities  and recently have brought cases against companies  and certain sales  marketing  and executive personnel  for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business 

table of contents another development affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal false claims act ffca  and in particular  action brought pursuant to the ffca s whistleblower or qui tam provisions 
the ffca imposes liability on any person or entity who  among other things  knowingly presents  or causes to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program 
the qui tam provisions of the ffca allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government  and to share in any monetary recovery 
in recent years  the number of suits brought against health care providers by private individuals has increased dramatically 
in addition  various states have enacted false claims law analogous to the ffca  although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third party payer and not merely a federal health care program 
when an entity is determined to have violated the ffca  it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus civil penalties of thousand to thousand per separate false claim 
liability arises  primarily  when an entity knowingly submits or causes another to submit a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the federal government has used the ffca to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care  kickbacks  and other improper referrals  and improper use of medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services  in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered 
in addition  the federal government has prosecuted companies under the ffca in connection with off label promotion of products 
our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products  the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal  state  and third party reimbursement of our products  and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws 
we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the ffca or a similar state law  or the impact of such actions 
however  the costs of defending such claims  as well as any sanctions imposed  could significantly affect our financial performance 
foreign corrupt practices act the foreign corrupt practices act of  as amended fcpa  was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business 
specifically  the anti bribery provisions of the fcpa prohibit the bribery of government officials 
hipaa and other fraud and privacy regulations the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa created two new federal crimes health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters 
the hipaa health care fraud statute prohibits  among other things  knowing and willfully executing  or attempting to execute  a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payors 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines  imprisonment  and or exclusion from government sponsored programs 
the hipaa false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing  or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious  or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items  or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 
pricing in the united states  our sales are dependent upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement for our products from third party payors  including federal and state programs such as medicare and medicaid  and private organizations such as commercial health insurance and managed care companies 
such third party payors increasingly challenge the price of medical products and services and instituting cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services 

table of contents over the past several years  the rising costs of providing health care services has triggered legislation to make certain changes to the way in which pharmaceuticals are covered and reimbursed  particularly by government programs 
for instance  recent federal legislation and regulations have created a voluntary prescription drug benefit  medicare part d  revised the formula used to reimburse health care providers and physicians under part b and imposed significant revisions to the medicaid drug rebate program 
these changes have resulted in  and may continue to result in  coverage and reimbursement restrictions and increased rebate obligations by manufacturers 
in addition  there continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care 
examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the united states may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include changing medicare reimbursement methodologies  revising drug rebate calculations under the medicaid program  reforming drug importation laws  fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies  and requiring pre approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies 
we cannot predict the likelihood or pace of such additional changes or whether there will be significant legislative or regulatory reform impacting our products  nor can we predict with precision what effect such governmental measures would have if they were ultimately enacted into law 
however  in general  we believe that legislative and regulatory reform activity likely will continue 
other applicable laws we are also subject to federal  state and local laws of general applicability  including laws regulating working conditions and the storage  transportation  or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances  hazardous waste  or environmental contaminants 
we monitor our compliance with laws and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulatory bodies 
as a publicly traded company  we are also subject to significant regulations and laws  included in the sarbanes oxley act of since its enactment  we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and we continue to update the program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements

table of contents item a 
risk factors we materially rely on an uninterrupted supply of finished products from jsp for a majority of our sales 
if we were to experience an interruption of that supply  our operating results would suffer 
approximately of our fiscal year net sales are of distributed products  primarily manufactured by jsp 
two of these products are levothyroxine sodium and digoxin  which accounted for and  respectively  of our fiscal net sales  and and  respectively  of our net sales for fiscal if the supply of these products is interrupted in any way by any form of temporary or permanent business interruption to jsp  including but not limited to fire or other naturally occurring  damaging event to their physical plant and or equipment  condemnation of their facility  legislative or regulatory cease and desist declaration regarding their operations  fda action  and any interruption in their source of api for their products  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we do not have  at this time  a second source for these products 
on august  the company reached an agreement with jsp to extend the term of the initial agreement 
refer to note subsequent events for more information 
the generic pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
we face strong competition in our generic product business 
revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents for brand name products and related exclusivity periods expire or fall under patent challenges  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration 
as competing off patent manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products or as brand manufacturers launch generic versions of such products for which no separate regulatory approval is required  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
consequently  we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross margins 
extensive industry regulation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our business  especially our product development  manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
all pharmaceutical companies  including lannett  are subject to extensive  complex  costly and evolving regulation by the federal government  including the fda and in the case of controlled drugs  the dea  and state government agencies 
the fdca  the csa and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacturing  packing  labeling  storing  record keeping  safety  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of our products 
the process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous  time consuming and costly  and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments 
we are dependent on receiving fda and other governmental or third party approvals prior to manufacturing  marketing and shipping our products 
the fda approval process for a particular product candidate can take several years and requires us to dedicate substantial resources to securing approvals  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner  or at all 
in order to obtain approval for our generic product candidates  we must demonstrate that our drug product is bioequivalent to a drug previously approved by the fda through the new drug approval process  known as an innovator drug 
bioequivalency may be demonstrated in vivo or in vitro by comparing the generic product candidate to the innovator drug product in dosage form  strength  route of administration  quality  dissolution performance characteristics  and intended use 
the fda may not agree that the bioequivalence studies we submit in the anda applications for our generic drug products are adequate to support approval 
if it determines that an anda application is not adequate to support approval  the fda could deny our application or request additional information  including clinical trials  which could delay approval of the product and impair our ability to compete with other versions of the generic drug product 
consequently  there is always the chance that we will not obtain fda or other necessary approvals  or that the rate  timing and cost of such approvals  will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations 
we carry inventories of certain product s in anticipation of launch  and if such product s are not subsequently launched  we may be required to write off the related inventory 
furthermore  the fda also has the authority to revoke drug approvals previously granted and remove these products from the market for a variety of reasons  including a failure to comply with applicable regulations  the discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  or because the ingredients in the drug are no longer approved by the fda 

table of contents additionally  certain products  marketed prior to the fdca may be considered grase or grandfathered 
grase products are those old drugs that do not require prior approval from fda in order to be marketed because they are generally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature 
similarly  grandfathered products are those which entered the market before the passage of the act  act or the amendments to the act 
under the grandfathered drug clause  such a product is exempted from the effectiveness requirements 
of the act 
if its composition and labeling have not changed since and if  on the day before the amendments became effective  it was used or sold commercially in the united states  not a new drug as defined by the act at that time  and not covered by an effective application 
recently  the fda has increased its efforts to force companies to file and seek fda approval for grase or grandfathered products 
efforts have included issuing notices to companies currently producing these products to cease its distribution of said products 
lannett currently manufactures and markets one product that is considered a grase or grandfathered product  c topical solution 
the fda is currently undertaking activities to force all companies who manufacture certain grase products to file applications and seek approval for these products or remove their products from the market 
as of july   lannett stopped manufacturing and distributing morphine sulfate oral solution ms as part of one the fda s enforcement actions 
lannett filed a b new drug application ms nda in february and was granted fda approval on the submission in june due to the length of time it took to receive approval on this application  the company fully reserved its ms inventory as of june  additionally  lannett stopped manufacturing oxycodone as of august  and stopped marketing the product as of october  lannett filed an anda in april and was granted expedited review by the fda 
the company expects to have approval from the fda and resume selling oxycodone in the near future 
in addition  lannett  as well as many of our significant suppliers of distributed product and raw materials  are subject to periodic inspection of facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of the finished products by the fda  the dea and other authorities  which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that pharmaceutical companies are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
the fda conducts pre approval and post approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether systems and processes are in compliance with cgmp  and other fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form that could cause us or our suppliers to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of a fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate cgmp or other fda regulations 
the dea and comparable state level agencies also heavily regulate the manufacturing  holding  processing  security  record keeping  and distribution of drugs that are considered controlled substances 
some of the pain management products we manufacture contain controlled substances 
the dea periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations 
if our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  it could result in regulatory action and additional costs 
our inability or the inability of our suppliers to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  delays in or denials of new product approvals  warning letters  fines  consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of sales  and or criminal prosecution 
any of these or other regulatory actions could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
although we have instituted internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could materially harm our business 
additionally  if the fda were to undertake additional enforcement activities with lannett s grase product  their actions could result in  among other things  removal of some of the product from the market  seizure of the product and total or partial suspension of sales 
any of these regulatory actions could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
our manufacturing operations as well as our suppliers manufacturing operations are subject to licensing by the fda and or dea 
if we or our suppliers are unable to maintain the proper agency licensing arrangements  our operating results would be materially negatively impacted 
all of our manufacturing operations as well as those of our suppliers rely on maintaining active licenses to produce and develop generic drugs 
specifically  our cody labs operations rely on a dea license to directly import and convert raw concentrated poppy straw into several apis or dosage forms 
this license is granted for a one year period and must be renewed successfully each year in order for us to maintain cody s current operations and allow the company to continue to work towards becoming a fully integrated narcotics supplier 
if the company is unable to successfully renew its fda and or dea licenses  the financial results of lannett would be negatively impacted 

table of contents if we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products  our operating results will suffer 
our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new generic products in a timely manner 
there are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products  including developing  testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner  receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner  the availability  on commercially reasonable terms  of raw materials  including apis and other key ingredients  developing and commercializing a new product is time consuming  costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of new products  and commercializing generic products may be substantially delayed by the listing with the fda of patents that have the effect of potentially delaying approval of the off patent product by up to months  and in some cases  such patents have been issued and listed with the fda after the key chemical patent on the brand drug product has expired or been litigated  causing additional delays in obtaining approval 
as a result of these and other difficulties  products currently in development by lannett may or may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary for marketing 
if any of our products  when developed and approved  cannot be successfully or timely commercialized  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped  even if we are successful in commercializing those products 
the loss of key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
the success of our present and future operations will depend  to a significant extent  upon the experience  abilities and continued services of our key personnel 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  or if they are unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason  our business may be significantly impaired 
if the employment of any of our current key personnel is terminated  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and replace the employee with the same caliber of key personnel 
as such  we have entered into employment agreements with all of our senior executive officers in order to help retain these key individuals 
our gross profit may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our product sales mix  our product pricing and our costs to manufacture or purchase products 
our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows depend to a significant extent upon our product sales mix 
our sales of certain products that we manufacture tend to create higher gross margins than do the products we purchase and resell 
as a result  our sales mix will significantly impact our gross profit from period to period 
factors that may cause our sales mix to vary include the amount of new product introductions  marketing exclusivity  if any  which may be obtained on certain new products  the level of competition in the marketplace for certain products  the availability of raw materials and finished products from our suppliers  and the scope and outcome of governmental regulatory action that may involve us 
the profitability of our product sales is also dependent upon the prices we are able to charge for our products  the costs to purchase products from third parties  and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner 

table of contents if brand pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative and regulatory efforts  our sales of generic products may suffer 
many brand pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics  using the citizen petition process to request amendments to fda standards  seeking changes to us pharmacopoeia  an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards  attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation  and engaging in state by state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs  which could have an impact on products that we are developing 
if brand pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means  our sales may decline 
if we experience a material decline in product sales  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will suffer 
third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
this is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the brand product is expiring  an area where infringement litigation is prevalent  and in the case of new brand products where a competitor has obtained patents for similar products 
litigation may be costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
in addition  if we infringe on the rights of others  we could lose our right to develop or manufacture products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials  our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded 
we are required to identify the supplier s of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the fda 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application 
however  some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and  in some of our drug applications  only one supplier of products and raw materials has been identified  even in instances where multiple sources exist 
to the extent any difficulties experienced by our suppliers cannot be resolved within a reasonable time  and at reasonable cost  or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the fda  our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease  and our development and sales and marketing efforts could be delayed 

table of contents our policies regarding returns  allowances and chargebacks  and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods 
based on industry practice  generic drug manufacturers have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post sale inventory allowances 
under these arrangements  from time to time  we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing 
therefore  if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products  we would likely reduce the price of our product 
as a result  we would be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products  which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided 
like our competitors  we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals  group purchasing organizations  pharmacies or other customers 
a chargeback is the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the wholesaler s end customer pays for a product 
although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods  we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns  allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates 
health care initiatives and other third party payor cost containment pressures could cause us to sell our products at lower prices  resulting in decreased revenues 
some of our products are purchased or reimbursed by state and federal government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  or hmos  and managed care organizations  or mcos 
third party payors increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing 
there also continues to be a trend toward managed health care in the united states 
pricing pressures by third party payors and the growth of organizations such as hmos and mcos could result in lower prices and a reduction in demand for our products 
in addition  legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care and government insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which pharmaceutical products and medical devices are prescribed and purchased 
we expect there will continue to be federal and state laws and or regulations  proposed and implemented  that could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services 
the extent to which future legislation or regulations  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain 
for example  the american recovery and reinstatement act of  also known as the stimulus package  includes billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies 
the stimulus package funding is expected to be used for  among other things  to conduct  support or synthesize research that compares and evaluates the risk and benefits  clinical outcomes  effectiveness and appropriateness of products 
although congress has indicated that this funding is intended for improvement in quality of health care  it remains unclear how the research will impact coverage  reimbursement or other third party payor policies 
such measures or other health care system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability 
we may need to change our business practices to comply with changes to fraud and abuse laws 
we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including the anti kickback statute  which apply to our sales and marketing practices and our relationships with physicians 
at the federal level  the anti kickback statute prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering  or paying any remuneration  including a bribe  kickback  or rebate  directly or indirectly  in return for or to induce the referral of patients for items or services covered by federal health care programs  or the furnishing  recommending  or arranging for products or services covered by federal health care programs 
federal health care programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government  including medicare and medicaid  among others 
the definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value  including  for example  gifts  discounts  the furnishing of supplies or equipment  credit arrangements  payments of cash  and waivers of payments 
several courts have interpreted the federal anti kickback statute s intent requirement to mean that if even one purpose in an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under federal health care programs  the statute has been violated 
the federal government has issued regulations  commonly known as safe harbors that set forth certain provisions which  if fully met  will assure parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal anti kickback statute 
the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement will be illegal or that prosecution under the federal anti kickback statute will be pursued  but such transactions or arrangements face an increased risk of scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and an ongoing risk of prosecution 
if our sales and marketing practices or our relationships with physicians such as physicians serving on our scientific advisory board are considered by federal or state enforcement authorities to be knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering  or providing any remuneration in exchange for arranging for or recommending our products and services  and such activities do not fit within a safe harbor  then these arrangements could be challenged under the federal anti kickback statute 

table of contents if our operations are found to be in violation of the federal anti kickback statute we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines of up to thousand per violation  civil monetary penalties of up to thousand per violation  assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration  imprisonment  and exclusion from participating in the federal health care programs 
in addition  hipaa and its implementing regulations created two new federal crimes health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters 
the hipaa health care fraud statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully executing  or attempting to execute  a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payors 
a violation of this statue is a felony and may result in fines  imprisonment and or exclusion from government sponsored programs 
the hipaa false statements statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items  or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 
a number of states also have anti fraud and anti kickback laws similar to the federal anti kickback statute that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments if such arrangements are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients or the furnishing of goods or services 
some states anti fraud and anti kickback laws apply only to goods and services covered by medicaid 
other states anti fraud and anti kickback laws apply to all health care goods and services  regardless of whether the source of payment is governmental or private 
due to the breadth of these laws and the potential for changes in laws  regulations  or administrative or judicial interpretations  we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful  which could materially adversely affect our business 
certain federal and state governmental agencies  including the us department of justice and the us department of health and human services  have been investigating issues surrounding pricing information reported by drug manufacturers and used in the calculation of reimbursements as well as sales and marketing practices 
for example  many government and third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse doctors and others for the purchase of certain pharmaceutical products based on the product s awp reported by pharmaceutical companies 
while lannett has only used suggested wholesale prices since  the federal government  certain state agencies  and private payors are investigating and have begun to file court actions related to pharmaceutical companies reporting practices with respect to awp  alleging that the practice of reporting prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in a false and overstated awp  which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by medicare beneficiaries  insurers  state medicaid programs  medical plans  and others to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products 
in addition  some of these same payors are also alleging that companies are not reporting their best price to the states under the medicaid program 
we are not currently subject to any such investigations or actions and having not used awp pricing since would not likely become subject to these investigations 
we may become subject to federal and state false claims litigation brought by private individuals and the government 
we are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement 
the federal false claims act ffca  also known as qui tam  imposes civil liability and criminal fines on individuals or entities that knowingly submit  or cause to be submitted  false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government 
violations of the ffca and other similar laws may result in criminal fines  imprisonment  and civil penalties for each false claim submitted and exclusion from federally funded health care programs  including medicare and medicaid 
the ffca also allows private individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the government against an individual or entity for violations of the ffca 
these suits  also known as qui tam actions  may be brought by  with only a few exceptions  any private citizen who has material information of a false claim that has not yet been previously disclosed 
these suits have increased significantly in recent years because the ffca allows an individual to share in any amounts paid to the federal government in fines or settlement as a result of a successful qui tam action 
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from federal health care programs  and or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
any penalties  damages  fines  curtailment  or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results  action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against them  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business 

table of contents sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the us this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains 
as a result  a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market  and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased 
we expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers  including lannett 
our three largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales for the fiscal year ended june   and  and  respectively  of our net sales for the fiscal year ended june  the loss of any of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and our cash flows 
in addition  the company generally does not enter into long term supply agreements with its customers that would require them to purchase our products 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties  and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable  if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate  a claim brought against lannett  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
rising insurance costs  as well as the inability to obtain certain insurance coverage for risks faced by lannett  could negatively impact profitability 
the cost of insurance  including workers compensation  product liability and general liability insurance  has risen in recent years and may increase in the future 
in response  we may increase deductibles and or decrease certain coverage to mitigate these costs 
these increases  and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverage  could have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
additionally  certain insurance coverage may not be available to lannett for risks faced by lannett 
sometimes the coverage obtained by lannett for certain risks may not be adequate to fully reimburse the amount of damage that lannett could possibly sustain 
should either of these events occur  the lack of insurance to cover the entire cost to the company would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
significant balances of intangible assets  including product rights acquired  are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our acquired contractual rights to market and distribute products are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization and related impairment charges identified to date 
we determined the initial cost by referring to the original fair value of the assets exchanged 
future amortization periods for product rights are based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors would require us to perform an additional impairment test on the affected asset and  if evidence of impairment exists  we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset 
such a charge would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of brand and generic products could adversely affect our business 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of brand drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the ftc or other governmental authorities 
the impact of this new requirement and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers is uncertain  and could adversely affect our business

table of contents item legal proceedings on april   richard asherman  the former president of cody and a member in realty  filed a complaint in wyoming state court against the company and cody 
at the same time  he also filed an application for a temporary restraining order to enjoin certain operations at cody  claiming  among other things  that cody is in violation of certain zoning laws and that cody is required to increase the level of its property insurance and to secure performance bonds for work being performed at cody 
mr 
asherman claims cody is in breach of his employment agreement and is required to pay him severance under his employment agreement  including months of base salary  vesting of unvested stock options and continuation of benefits 
the company estimates that the aggregate value of the claimed severance benefits is approximately thousand to thousand 
mr 
asherman also asserts that the company is in breach of the realty operating agreement and  among other requested remedies  he seeks to have lannett i pay him of the value of acres of land that realty agreed to donate to the city of cody  wyoming  which land was previously valued at approximately thousand  and ii acquire mr 
asherman s interest in realty for an unspecified price 
alternatively  mr 
asherman seeks to dissolve realty 
the company and cody opposed the application for a temporary restraining order and  following a hearing on april   the court denied the relief to mr 
asherman 
the company strongly disputes the claims in the complaint  including that the company is required to acquire mr 
asherman s interest in realty 
specifically  the company asserts that it is and has always been in compliance with local zoning laws  which permits the operation of a pharmaceutical facility  that mr 
asherman  in fact  previously represented this to lannett 
it also asserts that the city of cody has never taken the position or advised cody that the cody facility was operating in violation of the local zoning laws 
the company also asserts that cody has in place a sufficient level of property insurance coverage 
cody also strongly disputes the claims in the complaint  including that it is required to pay mr 
asherman severance  as cody terminated mr 
asherman for cause  following the issuance of a letter of reprimand 
if mr 
asherman were successful on his claim for breach of his employment agreement  he would be entitled to his contractual severance months salary plus the vesting of certain stock options and continuation of benefits 
the amount the company would be required to pay to mr 
asherman if he were successful in compelling the buyout of his interest in realty is dependent upon the value of the real property owned by realty 
if a buyout were required  realty would become wholly owned by the company 
at this time the company is unable to reasonably estimate a range or aggregate dollar amount of mr 
asherman s claims or of any potential loss to the company 
the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of the matter will have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

in addition  under certain arrangements  we may be required to make royalty payments based on a percentage of future sales  or other metric  for products currently in development in the event that the company begins to market and sell the product 
due to the inherent uncertainty related to these developmental  regulatory  commercial and or other milestones  it is unclear if the company will ever be required to make such payments 
as such  these contingencies are not reflected in the expected cash requirements for contractual obligations in the table above 
prospects for the future lannett continues to see substantial improvement year over year in many important financial metrics 
each passing year  our knowledge  skills and talent increase  as the company learns from its successes as well as its missteps 
the company is strengthening and building momentum to push to the next level within the generic pharmaceutical industry 
there are several strategic initiatives on which the company is embarking to continue its growth 

table of contents one initiative that is at the core of the company s strategy is to continue leveraging the asset we acquired in cody labs in in july  the dea granted cody labs a license to directly import concentrated poppy straw for conversion into opioid based apis for use in various dosage forms for pain management 
the value of this license comes from the fact that  to date  only six other companies in the us have been granted this license 
this license  along with cody labs expertise in api development and manufacture allows the company to perform in a market with high barriers to entry  no foreign competition  and limited domestic competition 
because of this vertical integration  the company has direct control of its supply and can avoid increased costs associated with buying apis from third party manufacturers  thereby achieving higher margins 
the company can also leverage this vertical integration not only for direct supply of opioid based apis  but also for the manufacture non opioid based apis 
the company believes that the demand for controlled substance  pain management drugs will continue to grow as the baby boomer generation ages 
by concentrating additional resources in the development of opioid based apis and dosage forms  the company is well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity 
the company is currently vertically integrated on two products with several others in various stages of development 
one product in particular which the company is working on is a cocaine hydrochloride solution 
this product is being manufactured and marketed under the brand name c topical solution 
this product is an analgesic topical solution  with vasoconstriction as a side effect  for use primarily by ear  nose and throat doctors during surgical procedures 
this product represents the company s first foray into the brand market 
selling brand versus generic products requires a dedicated sales force to detail and educate physicians on the product 
the company strongly believes that c topical  once the clinical trials are completed and the fda has granted approval  will be a major contributor to total revenue  with higher than average profit margins as a result of being vertically integrated  both the api and the finished dosage form are manufactured in house 
due to the competitive advantage gained by being vertically integrated  in general  and in controlled substance products  in particular  the company is poised to continue pushing the pace of sales growth in both the controlled substance and generic markets 
the company s strategic goal is to continue investing in controlled substance product development so that  within five years  of total revenue is derived from controlled substance products which carry with them higher than average gross margins 
as the company continues to invest and focus in process and manufacturing optimization  cody labs will continue to be an exciting part of our future 
in addition to focusing on the development and manufacture of opioid based apis and dosage forms  the company has made a strategic decision to develop products  both in house and with external partners  which require a paragraph four p iv certification when filing the anda 
a p iv certification is required when an anda is submitted for a product for which the innovator s patent has not expired 
the certification must state whether the patent on the reference listed drug rld is being challenged on grounds of it being invalid  or if the patent is being circumvented 
this path to product approval represents a major opportunity for generic drug companies because they do not have to wait until a particular patent expires to potentially enter the market 
secondly  if a company is the first to file a p iv on a product  and they successfully invalidate or circumvent the patent  the fda may grant days of market exclusivity 
this allows the generic manufacturer to be the sole competitor to the brand company for six months  during which time it will capture a significant portion of the market from the brand company  albeit at lower prices 
the challenge for generic manufacturers with this strategy is the legal costs involved 
before a product is selected for development  the company must perform a thorough review of the existing patents and determine if they are going to try to invalidate the patent or try to circumvent it 
in either case  once the company submits a p iv the brand company will have days to respond with a determination on whether they are going to file a suit against the generic company to defend their patent 
a generic company needs to be prepared not only for the time and effort associated with a protracted legal challenge  but the associated fees which can easily reach in excess of several million dollars 
this strategy provides a high risk  high reward path to product approval 
the company filed one anda with a p iv certification in fiscal and awaits a response from the brand company to learn what the next step will be in the process 
with the right research and analysis performed up front  the company believes it can target suitable products for which to file a p iv certification  be successful  and reap the rewards of limited competition 
another area of focus for the company is in mergers  acquisitions and other strategic alliances  whether new or continuing 
the company is party to supply and development agreements with international companies  including azad pharma ag and swiss caps of switzerland  pharma b formerly pharmaseed and the gc group of israel  as well as certain domestic companies  including jsp  cerovene and summit bioscience 
the company is currently in negotiations on similar agreements with other companies  and is actively seeking additional strategic partnerships  through which it will market and distribute products manufactured in house or by third parties 
the company continues to strengthen and leverage its customer relationships to build market share for such products and increase future revenues and income 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and the rules and regulations of the us securities exchange commission requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
a listing of the company s significant accounting policies are detailed in note summary of significant accounting policies 
a subsection of these accounting policies have been identified by management as critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those which require management to make estimates using assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different assumptions  which reasonably could have been used  could have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations 
management has identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition  inventories  income taxes  valuation of long lived assets  and share based compensation 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and provisions for estimates  including rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable 
the company also considers all other relevant criteria specified in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic no 
 revenue recognition  in determining when to recognize revenue 
when revenue is recognized a simultaneous adjustment to revenue is made for chargebacks  rebates  returns  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  known as shelf stock adjustments  and other potential adjustments 
these provisions are primarily estimated based on historical experience  future expectations  contractual arrangements with wholesalers and indirect customers  and other factors known to management at the time of accrual 
accruals for provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction to gross sales with the corresponding reserve presented as a reduction to accounts receivable or an increase in accrued expenses 
the reserves presented as a reduction of accounts receivable totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
accrued expenses at june  and included million and million  respectively  for certain rebate programs  primarily related to medicare part d and medicaid  and certain sales allowances and other adjustments paid to indirect customers at june  and the following table identifies the activity and ending balances of each major category of revenue reserve for fiscal years  and reserve category in thousands chargebacks rebates returns other total balance at july  current period provision credits issued during the period balance at june  current period provision credits issued during the period balance at june  current period provision credits issued during the period balance at june  for the years ending june   and  as a percentage of gross sales the provision for chargebacks was  and  the provision for rebates was  and  the provision for returns was  and  and the provision for other adjustments was  and  respectively 
the increase in total reserves was primarily due to an increase in the return reserve  which resulted from increased gross sales and the timing of credits issued 
the total increase was also aided by a small increase in the chargeback reserve 
the increase in the chargeback reserve resulted from increased inventory levels at wholesale distribution centers as a result of increased gross sales  partially offset by lower chargeback rates 
a lower rebate reserve also helped to offset the total increase in reserves due to the timing of credits issued  pricing changes and the purchasing patterns of certain customers 
the activity in the other category for the year ended june  includes shelf stock  shipping and other sales adjustments including prompt payment discounts 
historically  we have not recorded any material amounts in the current period related to reversals or additions of prior period reserves 
if the company were to record a material reversal or addition of any prior period reserve amount it would be separately disclosed 

table of contents provisions for chargebacks  rebates  returns and other adjustments require varying degrees of subjectivity 
while rebates generally are based on contractual terms and require less in the way of estimates  chargebacks and returns on the other hand require management to make more subjective assumptions 
each major category of provision is discussed in detail below chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors  generic distributors  retail pharmacy chains  and mail order pharmacies 
the company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
the company enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products 
if the price paid by the indirect customers is lower than the price paid by the wholesaler  the company will provide a credit  called a chargeback  to the wholesaler for the difference between the contractual price with the indirect customers and the wholesaler purchase price 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by the company s wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
as sales to the large wholesale customers  such as cardinal health  amerisourcebergen  and mckesson increase decrease  the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase decrease 
however  the size of the increase decrease depends on product mix and the amount of sales that end up at indirect customers with which the company has specific chargeback agreements 
the company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that expected chargebacks may differ from the actual chargeback reserve 
rebates rebates are offered to the company s key chain drug store  distributor and wholesaler customers to promote customer loyalty and increase product sales 
these rebate programs provide customers with rebate credits upon attainment of pre established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period 
other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers 
additionally  as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca enacted in the us in march  the company participates in a new cost sharing program for certain medicare part d beneficiaries designed primarily for the sale of brand drugs and certain generic drugs if their fda approval was granted under a new drug application nda or b nda versus an abbreviated new drug application anda 
because our drugs used for the treatment of thyroid deficiency and our morphine sulfate oral solution product were both approved by the fda as a b nda  they are considered brand drugs for purposes of the ppaca 
drugs purchased under this program during medicare part d coverage gap commonly referred to as the donut hole result in additional rebates 
the company estimates the reserve for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement when revenue is recognized 
the reserve for rebates increases decreases as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase decrease 
however  since these rebate programs are not identical for all customers  the size of the reserve will depend on the mix of sales to customers that are eligible to receive rebates 
returns consistent with industry practice  the company has a product returns policy that allows customers to return a product within a specified time period prior to and subsequent to the product s expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases 
the company s policy requires that the customer obtain pre approval from the company for any qualifying return 
the company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience  changes to business practices  credit terms and any extenuating circumstances known to management 
while historical experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past  future returns may or may not follow historical trends 
the company continually monitors the reserve for returns and makes adjustments when management believes that actual product returns may differ from the established reserve 
generally  the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase 
other adjustments other adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments  also known as shelf stock adjustments  which are credits issued to reflect decreases or increases in the selling prices of the company s products 
in the case of a price decrease a credit is given to customers for product remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction 
contractual price protection results in a similar credit in the case of a price increase 
pricing changes are discretionary decisions made by management to reflect competitive market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated changes in market prices  and estimates of inventory held by customers 
the company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available 
other adjustments also include prompt payment discounts 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first in  first out method 
inventories are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on current inventory levels and estimated sales forecasts 
during the fiscal year ended june   and the company recorded provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of thousand  million and million  respectively 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory at june  and was million and million  respectively 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes as prescribed by asc  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws or enacted tax rates in the period during which they are signed into law 
the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position claimed on a tax return only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the authoritative standards issued by the fasb also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
under asc income taxes  a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized through generating sufficient future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
the company s future effective income tax rate is highly reliant on future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  and potential tax planning strategies 
a change in one or all of these factors could materially affect the effective income tax rate of the company 
for the fiscal years ended june   and we recorded a provision benefit for income taxes of million  million and thousand  respectively 
effective tax rates for the same periods were  and  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets the company s long lived assets primarily consist of property  plant and equipment as well definite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful lives  generally for periods ranging from to years 
property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful lives  generally for periods ranging from to years 
the company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the nature and timing of triggering events by their very nature are unpredictable  however management regularly considers the performance of an asset as compared to its expectations  industry events  industry and economic trends  as well as any other relevant information known to management when determining if a triggering event occurred 
if a triggering event is determined to have occurred  the first step in the impairment test is to compare the asset s carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flow of the asset then impairment exists 
an impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  which in most cases is calculated using a discounted cash flow model 
discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions which are considered level inputs  including estimates of future cash flows including long term growth rates  discount rates  and the probability of achieving the estimated cash flows 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  the company did not identify any triggering events 
as a result no impairment charges were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  the company incurred depreciation and amortization expense of million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents share based compensation share based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period  using a straight line method  based on the fair value of the instrument on the date of grant less an estimate for forfeitures 
the company uses the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options and the stock price on the grant date to value restricted stock 
the black scholes valuation model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility  the expected life of the award  dividend yield  and the risk free interest rate 
these assumptions involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions which are generally outside the company s control 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on share based compensation costs recognized in the financial statements 
the following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to estimate fair values of the stock options granted during the years ended june and the estimated annual forfeiture rates used to recognize the associated compensation expense stock options fy stock options fy stock options fy risk free interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield forfeiture rate expected term in years years years years expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of our common shares during the historical period equal to the expected term of the option 
the company uses historical information to estimate the expected term  which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for the period equal to the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the forfeiture rate assumption is the estimated annual rate at which unvested awards are expected to be forfeited during the vesting period 
this assumption is based on our historical forfeiture rate 
periodically  management will assess whether it is necessary to adjust the estimated rate to reflect changes in actual forfeitures or changes in expectations 
additionally  the expected dividend yield is equal to zero  as the company has not historically and has no immediate plans to issue a dividend 
the following table presents the allocation of share based compensation costs recognized in the consolidated statements of operations by financial statement line item twelve months ended june  in thousands selling  general and administrative research and development cost of sales total tax benefit at statutory rate recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both options  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this authoritative guidance must be applied retrospectively  and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued an update deferring the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the adoption of this guidance by the company on july  did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as it only required a change in the format of the current presentation 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
the company adopted this guidance effective july  the adoption of this guidance by the company did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this authoritative guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance by the company did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
