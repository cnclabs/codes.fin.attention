table of contents overview we are a leading global supplier of automatic test equipment 
we design  develop  manufacture and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test semiconductors  wireless products  hard disk drives and circuit boards in the consumer electronics  wireless  automotive  industrial  computing  communications and aerospace and defense industries 
our automatic test equipment products and services include semiconductor test semiconductor test systems  wireless test wireless test systems  and military aerospace mil aero test instrumentation and systems  storage test storage test systems  circuit board test and inspection commercial board test systems  collectively these products represent systems test group 
we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers idms  outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers osats  wafer foundries  fabless companies that design  but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits ics  developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics  manufacturers of circuit boards  automotive suppliers  wireless product manufacturers  storage device manufacturers  aerospace and military contractors 
in  we acquired litepoint corporation litepoint to expand our product portfolio of test equipment in the wireless test sector 
litepoint designs  develops  and supports advanced wireless test solutions for the development and manufacturing of wireless devices  including smart phones  tablets  notebooks laptops  personal computer peripherals  and other wi fi and cellular enabled devices 
litepoint is our wireless test segment 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
these cyclical periods have had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry 
historically  these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations 
this was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year where we saw a significant decrease in revenues in our semiconductor test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy  which negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry 
the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 
we believe our acquisitions of litepoint  eagle test and nextest  and our entry into the high speed memory and storage test markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth 
we will continue to invest in our business to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 
on march   we completed the sale of our diagnostic solutions business unit  which was included in the systems test group segment  to spx corporation for million in cash 
we sold this business as its growth potential as a stand alone business was significantly less than if it was part of a larger automotive supplier 
the financial information for diagnostic solutions has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

table of contents preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  deferred tax assets  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 
our equipment has non software and software components that function together to deliver the equipment s essential functionality 
revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point  provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price besp 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 
our post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product 
we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts and asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 
our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized 
we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 
retirement and postretirement plans effective january   we changed the method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plan and calculating the expected return on plan assets for our 
table of contents defined benefit pension plans 
historically  we recognized net actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortized them into operating results over the average remaining years of service of the plan participants  to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a range corridor 
we elected to immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 
in addition  we used to calculate the expected return on plan assets using a calculated market related value of plan assets 
effective january   we elected to calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets 
we believe that this new method is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses in our operating results and it will improve the transparency by faster recognition of the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan obligations and investments 
these actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december and  accordingly  will be recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  accounting changes and error corrections  all prior periods presented in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to apply the new accounting method retrospectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value 
we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix  and possible alternative uses 
equity incentive and stock purchase plans stock based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation 
as required by asc  we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
we consider the probability of future taxable income and our historical profitability  among other factors  in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
as a result of this review  undertaken at december   we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions  most notably the united states 
at december   we reassessed this judgment and concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized through consideration of both the positive and negative evidence 
the evidence consisted primarily of our three year us historical cumulative profitability  projected future taxable income  forecasted utilization of the deferred tax assets and the fourth quarter of acquisition of litepoint offset by the volatility of the industries we operate in  primarily the semiconductor industry 
as such  we reduced the valuation allowance by million  which was recorded as a tax benefit in the year ended december  at december  and  we maintained a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  primarily related to excess stock compensation deductions associated with pre activity  state net operating losses and state tax credit carryforwards  due to uncertainty regarding their realization 
adjustments could be required in the future if we estimate that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount we have recorded 

table of contents on january   the american taxpayer relief act of was enacted which retrospectively reinstated the research and development tax credit for and extended it through december  as a result  in the first quarter of  we expect to record a discrete benefit related to of approximately million 
investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc  investments debt and equity securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other than temporary impairment 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets we assess the impairment of intangible and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently  when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
no goodwill impairment was identified in or

retirement plans asc  compensation retirement benefits defined benefit plans requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december for other postretirement benefit plans  the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december our pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan us plan  certain qualified plans for us subsidiaries  and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million for the year ended december  the largest portion of our pension expense was million for our us plan 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations 
discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis 
we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover periodically  and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption  we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
based on this review  we believe that was an appropriate rate to use for we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust the rate as necessary 
the december  asset allocation for our us plan is invested in fixed income securities  invested in equity securities  and invested in other securities 
our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 
effective january   we have elected to immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 
in addition  we used to calculate the expected return on plan assets using a calculated market related value of plan assets 
effective january   we elected to calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets 
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan s expected cash flows and was at december  
table of contents  down from at december  we estimate that in we will recognize approximately million of pension income for the us plan 
the us plan related pension income estimate for is based on a discount rate and return on assets 
future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans

we performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the potential us plan income expense for the year ending december   which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 
the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses 
it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control  such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 
discount rate return on plan assets in millions the assets of the us plan consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities 
us plan assets have decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was due primarily to million of payments made to certain former us employees which were offered an option to receive their vested pension benefit as a one time  lump sum payment

for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
the provisions of this asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after january  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents  marketable securities  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies 
our fixed income available for sale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in euro  british pound  japanese yen and the taiwan dollar 
these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates 
our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in short term and long term marketable securities 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates of basis points was assumed 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december  and
