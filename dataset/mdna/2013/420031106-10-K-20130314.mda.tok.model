item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  unless the context otherwise requires  we  us or the company refers  collectively  to hawaiian telcom holdco  inc and its subsidiaries 
the statements in the discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook  our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non historical statements in the discussion and analysis are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described in item a  risk factors 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion together with item  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
chapter reorganization on december   we and certain of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code and on october   the company emerged from chapter for further information regarding these petitions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the plan of reorganization  all of the existing common stock and stock options were cancelled upon emergence and the equity holders received no recovery 
our emergence from chapter on the emergence date resulted in a new reporting entity and the new shares of common stock were issued to the former secured lenders and swap counterparties 
we adopted fresh start reporting as of october  as required by fresh start accounting  our assets and liabilities have been adjusted to fair value 
accordingly  our financial condition and results of operations after october  are not comparable to the financial condition and result of operations for periods prior to and on october  wavecom solutions corporation acquisition on december   we completed our acquisition of wavecom solutions corporation wavecom for million in cash  net of cash acquired and final purchase price adjustments 
wavecom provides telecommunication services in the state of hawaii which are complementary to our operations 
because the acquisition occurred on december   the financial results of wavecom had no impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  segments and sources of revenue we operate in two reportable segments wireline services and wireless based on how resources are allocated and performance is assessed by our chief operating decision maker 
our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer 
wireline services the wireline services segment derives revenue from the following sources local telephone services we receive revenue from providing local exchange telephone services 
these revenues include monthly charges for basic service  local private line services and enhanced calling features such as voice mail  caller id and way calling 
network access services we receive revenue for access to our network for wholesale carrier data  business customer data including dedicated internet access  switched carrier access and subscriber line 
table of contents charges imposed on end users 
switched carrier access revenue compensates us for origination  transport and termination of calls for long distance and other interexchange carriers 
long distance services we receive revenue from providing long distance services to our customers 
high speed internet hsi services we provide hsi to our residential and business customers 
video services our video services marketed as hawaiian telcom tv is an advanced entertainment service offered to customers in select areas 
equipment and managed services we provide installation and maintenance of customer premise equipment as well as managed service for customer telephone and it networks 
wireless we receive revenue from wireless services  including the sale of wireless handsets and other wireless accessories 
results of operations for the years ended december   and as discussed above  we emerged from chapter and adopted fresh start reporting on october  references to predecessor refer to the company prior to and on october  references to successor refer to the company after october  after giving effect to the plan of reorganization and application of fresh start reporting 
as a result of the application of fresh start reporting  the successor financial statements are not comparable with the predecessor financial statements 
however  for purposes of the discussion of the results of operations  the combined ten months ended october  and two months ended december  have been compared to the year ended december  we believe this combined information is useful to the readers of this annual report in understanding changes in our results of operations 
significant changes in operating results for the successor  as compared to predecessor periods  relate primarily to depreciation and amortization because of changes in the basis of long lived assets  and changes in interest expense with a new borrowing facility in place 
in this discussion  we will disclose the fresh start and other impacts on our results of operations that vary from historical predecessor periods to aid in the understanding of our financial performance 
operating revenues the following tables summarize our volume information as of december   and  and our operating revenues for the years ended december   and the volume information excludes customers of wavecom 
as we acquired this subsidiary on december  no revenue was reflected in our results of operations 
hence  its volume information is not meaningful in analyzing our performance

these changes were made to provide additional insight into our operations and to reflect the strategic emphasis on potential growth products such as business data and video 
certain reclassifications were made to the information to conform to the presentation 
to provide further insight  we have provided revenue information by channel as well 
the decrease in local services revenues was caused primarily by the decline in voice access lines of million of the decline in revenue 
continued competition in the telecommunications industry has increasingly resulted in customers using technologies other than traditional phone lines for voice and data 
residential customers are increasingly using wireless services in place of traditional wireline phone service as well as moving local voice service to voip technology offered by competitors 
generally  voip technology offered by cable providers is less expensive than traditional wireline phone service  requiring us to respond with more competitive pricing 
additionally  competitive local exchange carriers clecs and our cable competitor continue to focus on business customers and selling services to our customer base 
in an effort to slow the rate of line loss  we are continuing retention and acquisition programs  and are increasingly focusing efforts on bundling of services 
we have instituted various saves campaigns designed to focus on specific circumstances where we believe customer churn is controllable 
these campaigns include targeted offers to at risk customers as well as other promotional tools designed to 
table of contents enhance customer retention 
we are also continuing to emphasize win back and employee referral programs 
additionally  we are intensifying our efforts relative to developing tools and training to enhance our customer service capability to improve customer retention 
network access services revenue for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the prior year because certain wireless carriers disconnected lower bandwidth circuits replaced with new more efficient higher bandwidth circuits resulting in a reduction in wholesale carrier data revenue for the year 
we anticipate the data volume and related revenue will increase in future periods as wireless carriers deploy their enhanced wireless networks 
in addition  the impact of the decline in voice access lines is reflected in subscriber line access charges and switched carrier access charges 
these reductions were partially offset by growth in business data revenue 
the decrease in long distance revenue was primarily because of the decline in long distance lines and customers moving to wireless and voip based technologies for long distance calling 
hsi revenues increased when compared to the prior year primarily because an approximate growth in our hsi subscribers million of the increase in revenue 
we are continuing to focus on upgrading our network to expand the reach of our higher bandwidth premium services 
on july   we commercially launched our video service on the island of oahu 
we are deploying hawaiian telcom tv gradually to selected areas to ensure delivery of superior service and an ongoing excellent customer experience 
we have initiated targeted marketing efforts resulting in penetration rates exceeding expectations 
our volume is anticipated to continue to ramp up as more homes become enabled for video service 
we expect to expand both the availability and the capabilities of our hawaiian telcom tv service over the next several years through additional capital investment and innovation 
equipment and managed services sales have decreased because of less sales and installations of customer premise equipment for certain large government customers in revenue from equipment sales varies from period to period based on the volume of large installation projects 
the volume of such projects in future periods is uncertain 
wireless revenues decreased as we attempted to focus our marketing efforts on other segments of our business

the costs for the year ended december  were comparable to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales and marketing  information systems and other administrative functions 
the decrease in such expenses was primarily because of reduced labor costs of million on lower average headcount and reduced pension costs 
in addition  there was a decline in bad debt expense of million primarily because of the settlement of balances due from wavecom solutions corporation as described in note to the consolidated financial statements

successor combined successor predecessor for the year ended december  for the year ended december  period from november to december  period from january to october  year over year change amount percentage interest expense interest income and other interest expense decreased primarily because the company was no longer accruing paid in kind interest on debt in conjunction with the chapter proceeding 

table of contents reorganization items reorganization items represent amounts incurred as a direct result of the company chapter filing and are presented separately in our consolidated statements of income 
such income and expense items consisted of the following dollars in thousands successor predecessor for the year ended december  period from november to december  period from january to october  professional fees effects of the plan of reorganization fresh start valuation of assets and liabilities other the company emerged from chapter in october but continued to incur reorganization related expenses until december as the chapter cases were not closed until january reorganization professional fees declined as the activity related to the chapter reorganization diminished 
the implementation of the plan of reorganization resulted in income of million 
this reflects the discharge of prepetition liabilities in accordance with the plan of reorganization offset by the value of new debt and equity issued in conjunction with the plan 
in conjunction with the adoption of the plan of reorganization  we adopted fresh start reporting resulting in changes to carrying value of assets and liabilities to reflect fair values 
the loss recorded from the adoption of fresh start amounted to million 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit differs from amounts determined by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of to the income or loss before income taxes primarily because of changes in the valuation allowance previously established for the recovery of deferred income tax assets 
as of december   we had maintained a full valuation allowance over our net deferred income tax assets 
this situation resulted from our having a short history as a new entity post chapter 
from emergence in through  we have generated earnings in all periods 
as a result of our continued positive annual earnings  as well as positive forecasted earnings in the future  management concluded that it was more likely than not that we will realize our deferred income tax assets  and therefore  we released our valuation allowance as of december  if there is a decline in the level of actual future or forecasted earnings  the conclusion regarding the need for a valuation allowance may change in future periods resulting in the establishment of a valuation allowance for some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash of million 
from an ongoing operating perspective  our cash requirements going into consist of supporting the development and introduction of new products  capital expenditure projects  pension funding obligations and other changes in working capital 
a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operating activities will be used to fund our operating activities 

table of contents we have continued to take actions to conserve cash and improve liquidity 
efforts have also been taken to generate further operating efficiencies and focus on expense management 
we have focused on improving operating results  including efforts to simplify product offerings  improve our customer service experience and increase our revenue enhancement activities 
there can be no assurance that these additional actions will result in improved overall cash flow 
we continue to have sizable retirement obligations for our existing employee base 
any sustained declines in the value of pension trust assets or higher levels of pension lump sum benefit payments will increase the magnitude of future plan contributions 
agreements with the hawaii public utilities commission and the debt agreements of hawaiian telcom communications  inc limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company and restrict the net assets of all of our subsidiaries 
this can limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
as the parent company has no operations  debt or other obligations  this restriction has no other immediate impact on our operations 
cash flows our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations 
we use the net cash generated from operations to fund network expansion and modernization 
we expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed through internally generated funds 
we also expect to use cash generated in future periods for debt service 
additional debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional development activities or to maintain our capital structure to ensure financial flexibility 
available cash and borrowing capacity is expected to be sufficient to fund cash requirements for the next twelve months 
net cash provided by operations amounted to million for net cash provided by operations amounted to million for our cash flows from operations are impacted by our results of operations  changes in working capital and payments on certain long term liabilities such as pension obligations 
our results of operations were discussed above 
the increase in cash provided by operations was because of improved management of working capital 
pension plan contributions amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we typically generate positive cash flow from operations and expect to do so in we anticipate using the cash generated by operations for capital expenditures and for required debt payments 
cash used in investing activities was comprised of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
investing activities for the year ended december  included the acquisition of wavecom for million net of cash acquired and final purchase price adjustments 
the level of capital expenditures for is expected to be comparable to as we invest in our network and systems to support new product introductions and enable next generation technologies 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was related primarily to the refinancing of our debt 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  amounted to million and was comprised primarily of payments on a capital lease of million and revolving loan refinancing costs of million 
outstanding debt and financing arrangements as of december   we had outstanding million in aggregate long term debt and an undrawn million revolving line of credit 
our bank credit facilities contain various negative and affirmative covenants that restrict  among other things  incurrence of additional indebtedness  payment of dividends  redemptions of stock  other 
table of contents distributions to shareholders and sales of assets 
in addition  there are financial covenants which have the following metrics as of december  interest coverage with maximum allowed ratio of of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense  leverage with maximum allowed ratio of of indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined  and a maximum level of annual capital expenditures of million 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  on february   we refinanced the existing term debt with a new five year term loan 
with our new debt structure  we do not expect to generate the necessary cash flow from operations to repay the facility in its entirety by the maturity date and repayment is dependent on our ability to refinance the credit facility at reasonable terms 
the ability to refinance the indebtedness at reasonable terms before maturity cannot be assured 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our long term debt and contractual obligations for the next several years 
pension funding obligations are based on known funding 
additional obligations are expected in future periods 
obligations are as follows dollars in thousands to and and thereafter total term loan facility debt interest pension funding obligations operating leases supplier contracts total existing debt at december  computed based on debt outstanding and the interest rate in effect at december  for the contractual term 
represents pension funding expected for additional funding will be required in future years 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing or other arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
the following is a summary of certain policies considered critical by management 
indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair value is an estimate based on the present value of an expected range of future cash flows 
for the brand name intangible asset  future cash flows were 
table of contents estimated using a relief of royalty method using an assumed royalty rate for the brand name asset of one percent applied to projected revenues 
the expected range of future cash flows is based on internal forecasts developed utilizing management knowledge of the business and the anticipated effects of market forces 
the use of different assumptions or estimates of future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all 
significant assumptions which are reasonably possible of changing in future periods relate to projection of future cash flows generated by the indefinite lived intangible assets which are dependent on projections of company wide revenues in future periods and the discount rate used to calculate the present values of cash flows based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital 
as of december   the fair value of the trade name intangible assets exceeded the carrying value by approximately ten percent 
impairment of long lived assets and definite lived intangibles we assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such cases  if the sum of the expected cash flows  undiscounted and without interest  resulting from use of the asset is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets 
when determining future cash flow estimates  we consider historical operating results  as adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by us in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization 
significant assumptions which are reasonably possible of changing in future periods relate to projection of future cash flows generated by the long lived assets which are dependent on projections of company wide profitability and capital expenditures for maintaining our network in future periods 
in addition  estimates of the cash generating useful lives are also critical to such evaluations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  the earnings process is complete and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize service revenues based upon usage of our local exchange network and facilities and contract fees 
in general  fixed fees for local telephone  internet access  television and certain other services are billed one month in advance and recognized the following month when earned 
revenue from other products that are not fixed fee or that exceed contracted amounts is recognized when such services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects reserves for customer receivables to reduce receivables to amounts expected to be collected 
in estimating uncollectible amounts  management considers factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
while we believe our process effectively addresses our exposure for doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts recognized by us 
income taxes management calculates the income tax provision  current and deferred income taxes along with the valuation allowance based upon various complex estimates and interpretations of income tax laws and regulations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely 
table of contents than not that they will not be realized 
the most significant assumption in this process are projections of future income which are reasonably possible of changing in future periods 
employee related benefits we incur certain employee related costs associated with pensions and post retirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the expense associated with these employee related benefits  management must make a variety of estimates  including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses  compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated healthcare costs 
the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience  as well as current facts and circumstances 
we use third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expenses associated with these employee related benefits 
different estimates could result in our recognizing different amounts of expense over different time periods 
the discount rate used for determining the year end benefit plan obligation was generally calculated using a weighting of expected benefit payments and rates associated with high quality us corporate bonds for each year of expected payment to derive a single estimated rate at which the benefits could be effectively settled 
the estimated return on plan assets was based on historical trends combined with long term expectations 
in selecting the rate of return on plan assets for purposes of determining net periodic benefit cost  we considered economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans primarily equity and fixed income investments  and the plans asset allocations 
while primary emphasis was on the economic forecasts of long term returns  consideration was given to the past performance of the plans assets 
the assumption is based on consideration of all inputs  with a focus on long term trends to avoid short term market influences 
assumptions are not changed unless structural trends in the underlying economy are identified  our asset strategy changes  or there are significant changes in other inputs 
the method for selecting the expected return on plan assets did not change from prior periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   our floating rate obligations consisted of million of debt outstanding under our term loan facility 
accordingly  our earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
based on our borrowings at december  and assuming a percentage point increase in the average interest rate under these borrowings  we estimate that our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
