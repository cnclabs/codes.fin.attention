economic overview fiscal proved to be another year of slow growth both nationally and in the geographic markets where we operate 
the united states gross domestic product gdp improved each of the first three quarters of before decreasing slightly in the fourth quarter 
for the full year  the economy experienced year over year growth of 
while the economy continues to show improvement  the rate of growth remains well below a historical normalized rate of 
growth was also sustained by increasing contributions from consumer spending  which grew at an average monthly rate of for  matching the rate of growth for both and unemployment declined  beginning at and ending at in home values rose slightly and equities  despite much uncertainty  finished the year with substantial gains 
regulatory reform developments as discussed in more detail above  on july   president obama signed the dodd frank act into law 
the dodd frank act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the united states  reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises  and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies 
the dodd frank act implements numerous and far reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies  including banks and bank holding companies such as bkfc 
for a review of the various changes that the dodd frank act implements  see regulation and supervision the dodd frank act in item business of this annual report 
many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being developed and or implemented 
performance overview in  bkfc was able to achieve strong operating results in a difficult banking environment 
the primary factors contributing to this difficult environment included slow loan growth  compressing net interest margins and high regulatory burdens 
despite these challenges  overall improving credit metrics accompanied with modest revenue increases which more than offset higher overhead expenses  produced a increase in net income available to bkfc common shareholders in as compared to the provision for loan losses decreased  and total revenue increased  which partially offset an increase in non interest expense of in as compared to although slower than the pre recession pace  bkfc s loan growth in was the highest organic loan growth experienced since the current recession began in total loans increased million  or  with the majority of the growth occurring in the second half of the operating results were also positively influenced by bkfc s exit of the tarp program in increased capital provided by available earnings allowed bkfc to repurchase the remaining million tarp cpp investment in november of this repurchase accompanied with the repurchase of the first half of the tarp cpp investment led to a decrease in the preferred stock dividends and amortization in as compared to as discussed above  management believes that bkfc has benefited from the improvements in the economy 
this is demonstrated in the improving credit metrics as compared to net charge offs decreased from  in to  in and criticized and classified loans decreased from  at the end of to  at the end of these improving credit quality metrics led the bank to provide  in the provision for loans losses in compared to  in while net charge offs and criticized and classified loans both decreased in  they remained at a historically high level 
while the economy continued to show signs of improvement during  bkfc continued to experience levels of defaults and foreclosures higher than historical levels during fiscal such default levels have been significantly less as compared to other regions of the country 
this is due  in part  to the fact that bkfc s market in northern kentucky and cincinnati did not experience as dramatic a rise in real estate values over the last several years as compared to other markets  such as florida and california 
while bkfc s local markets have not been affected as severely as other markets  management continues to closely monitor developments in the real estate market  given that the majority of the bank s loan portfolio is real estate related 
while the level of resources devoted to the credit review function and working out problem loans continued to be high in  bkfc did not make significant changes to its loan underwriting standards 
bkfc s willingness to make loans to qualified applicants that meet its traditional  prudent lending standards has not changed 
while bkfc benefited from the slow recovery and the improving credit metrics as compared to  management does not foresee a return to pre recession levels of credit metrics  and particularly provisioning expense  in the near future 
despite the recovery  high unemployment and low real estate values continued to place significant economic strain on a majority of the bank s business partners 
the bank s loan portfolio has been most significantly affected by economic conditions 
the following sections provide more detail on subjects presented in this overview 
critical accounting policies bkfc has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this annual report in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  bkfc makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses as critical to the understanding of bkfc s results of operations  since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in reporting materially different amounts if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
the bank maintains an allowance to absorb probable  incurred loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the bank considers to be adequate and is based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans 
loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are based on the bank s review of its historical loan loss experience and such factors that  in management s judgment  deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable loan losses 
the bank s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of well defined credit policies  uniform underwriting criteria  and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures 
the credit risk management strategy also includes assessments of compliance with commercial and consumer policies  risk ratings and other important credit information 
the strategy also emphasizes regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration in credit quality 
the bank strives to identify potential problem loans early and promptly undertake the appropriate actions necessary to mitigate or eliminate the increasing risk identified in these loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two components  the specific reserve  pursuant to asc  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and the general reserve  pursuant to asc  accounting for contingencies 
a loan is considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
the specific reserve component is an estimate of loss based upon an impairment review of larger loans that are considered impaired 
the general reserve includes an estimate of commercial and consumer loans with similar characteristics 
depending on the set of facts with respect to a particular loan  the bank utilizes one of the following methods for determining the proper impairment of a loan the present value of expected future cash flows of a loan  the market price of the loan based upon readily available information for that type of loan  and the fair value of collateral 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based  for all collateral dependent loans  on the fair market value of the collateral  less the estimated cost to liquidate 
for non collateral dependent loans such as accruing troubled debt restructurings  the allowance is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted by the loan s effective interest rate 
a small portion of the bank s loans which are impaired under the asc process carry no specific reserve allocation 
these loans were reviewed for impairment and are considered adequately collateralized with respect to their respective outstanding principal loan balances 
the majority of these loans are loans which have had their respective impairment or specific reserve amounts charged off  or are loans related to other impaired loans which continue to have a specific reserve allocation 
it is the bank s practice to maintain these impaired loans  as analyzed and provided for in the asc component of the allowance for loan losses  to avoid double counting of any estimated losses that may have been included in the asc component of the allowance for loan losses 
generally  the bank orders a new or updated appraisal on real estate properties which are subject to an impairment review 
upon completion of the impairment review  loan reserves are increased as warranted 
charge offs  if necessary  are generally recognized in a period after the reserves were established 
adjustments to new or updated appraisal values are not typically done  but in those cases when an adjustment is necessary  it is documented with supporting information and typically results in an adjustment to decrease the property s value because of additional information obtained concerning the property after the appraisal or update has been received by the bank 
the bank s practice is to obtain new or updated appraisals or evaluation on the loans subject to impairment 
if a new or updated appraisal is not available at the time of a loan s impairment review  the bank typically applies a discount to the value of an old appraisal to reflect the property s current estimated value if there is believed to be deterioration in either i the physical or economic aspects of the subject property or ii any market conditions 
updated valuations on to family residential properties with small to moderate values are generally accomplished by obtaining an evaluation or appraisal 
generally  an as is value is utilized in most of the bank s real estate based impairment analyses 
however  under certain limited circumstances  an as stabilized valuation may be utilized  provided that the as stabilized value is tied to a well justified action plan to bring the real estate project to a stabilized occupancy under a reasonable period of time 
if a partially charged off loan has been restructured in a manner that is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to prudently modified terms  and has sustained historical payment performance for a reasonable period of time prior to and or after the restructuring  it may be returned to accrual status and is classified as a tdr loan 
however  if the above conditions can not be reasonably met  the loan remains on non accrual status 
in addition  the bank evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for loans to be placed on non accrual status 
non accrual status denotes loans in which  in the opinion of management  the collection of additional interest is unlikely 
a loan is generally placed on non accrual status if i it becomes days or more past due or ii for which payment in full of both principal and interest cannot be reasonably expected 
historical loss rates are applied to all other loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
the loss rates applied to loans are derived from analyzing the loss experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk rating 
these loss rates may be adjusted to account for environmental factors 
the general reserve also includes homogeneous loans  such as consumer installment  residential mortgage and home equity loans that are not individually risk graded 
for these loans that are not individually risk graded  the historical loss experience of the portfolio is used to determine the appropriate allowance for the portfolios 
allocations for the allowance are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs for one year 
in the second quarter of  management developed a detailed approach to setting the environmental adjustments to the historical loss rates and discontinued the use of high and low range of reserve percentages 
management believes that this more detailed approach adds efficiencies and provides more precision to the allowance for loan losses estimations 
factors that management considers as part of this approach in setting the environmental adjustments include economic trends  loan policies  lender experience  loan growth  delinquency trend  non performing asset trends  classified loan trends and credit concentrations 
reserves on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions  as well as actual collection and charge off experience 
charge offs are recognized when it becomes evident that a loan or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible regardless of its delinquent status 
the bank generally charges off that portion of a loan that is determined to be unsupported by an obligor s continued ability to repay the loan from income and or assets  both pledged and unpledged as collateral 
financial condition highlighting the changes to the bkfc balance sheet from december  to december  was loan growth 
in  bkfc had the highest organic loan growth that it has experienced since the most recent recession 
total loans increased  or  from the end of to the end of this contrasts to the previous two years  where total loans decreased in and were nearly flat in after the effect of the ukb transaction was taken into account 
total deposits increased  or  from the end of to the end of  while total short term borrowings increased  or  in the same period 
total capital increased  or  from the end of to the end of the increase in capital was a result of increase in retained earnings  which was partially offset by a dividend of  declared in december of to be paid in january of in connection with bkfc s decision to pay dividends on a quarterly basis starting in bkfc previously paid dividends on a semi annual basis 
as a result of these changes  the bank s total assets increased  or  from  at december  to  at december  other changes on the asset side of the balance sheet included a  or  increase in loans held for sale  and a  or  increase in held to maturity securities  which was partially offset by a  or  decrease in available for sale securities 
the increase in loans held for sale was a result of the high level of mortgage loan refinancing activity 
the increase in held to maturity securities was a result of purchases of kentucky municipal bonds  while the decrease in available for sale securities was a result of government sponsored agency bonds being called in the low rate environment of all of the loan portfolios except the municipal obligations increased in the largest increase in loans came from the commercial real estate portfolio  which increased  or  which was partially offset by a  or  decrease in the municipal obligation portfolio 
management of the bank was encouraged by the increase in loan demand experienced in the second half of and intends to continue to make loans that meet its longstanding prudent lending standards 
the largest increase in deposits came from non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  which increased  or  from management believes that the low level of interest offered to corporate customers on alternative short term investments contributed to the increase in non interest bearing accounts 
the bank also experienced a significant increase in interest bearing transaction now accounts and savings accounts which increased  or  and  or  respectively  in the increase in now and savings accounts were partially offset by a  or  decrease in certificates of deposit cds from the end of management believes that the lower level of interest rates offered on cds have made them less desirable to consumers

provision for loan losses like many other financial institutions  the bank has been significantly affected by the national economic recession and the continued challenging economic environment 
while the bank experienced an increase in defaults and foreclosures since the recession began  the levels of such activity has been significantly less than other regions in the country due  in part  to the fact that the bank s market in the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati area did not experience as dramatic a rise in real estate values over the last several years as other markets 
management believes that with the continuing economic uncertainty  high unemployment rates and low real estate values  the resulting pressure on earnings will remain above historical levels 
this will include continuing higher levels of charge offs in the loan portfolio  and as a result  higher provisions for loan losses and a higher reserve for loan losses on the balance sheet 
higher provisions for loan losses will lead to lower earnings and slower capital growth 
management also believes that the current economic conditions will lead to lower than historical levels of demand for loans 
while the economic conditions continue to be challenging  the provision for loan losses reflected the improving economy that was discussed above in the economic overview 
while still well above historical levels  the credit metrics showed improvement in as compared to vs 
as discussed above under management overview  the provision for loan losses reflected the slow economic recovery

troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
in certain circumstances  the bank may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due 
in cases where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near term  concessionary modification is granted to minimize or eliminate the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral 
modifications may include interest rate reductions  extension of the maturity date or a reduction in the principal balance 
restructured loans accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the modified terms 
performing tdrs are loans that are paying as to the agreed upon modified terms and are not more than days past due 
nonperforming tdrs are the remainder 
total performing tdrs  which are not considered non performing loans by management  were  at december  as compared to  at december  total nonperforming tdrs were  at december  as compared to  at december  in order to proactively manage and resolve problem loans  the bank expects higher than normal levels of tdrs as it continues to work with relationships that show signs of stress 
all tdrs are considered impaired loans and any specific reserves related to the tdrs are included in the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet 
any additional specific reserves related to tdrs added or reduced in a period would be reflected in the provision for loan losses on the income statement for that period 
ordinarily  loans are identified as potential problem loans  through a higher risk weighting  before actually being restructured 
allowance for loan losses all 
the decrease in the all was directionally consistent in with the improving credit metrics and the slow economic recovery 
the all decreased  from  at december  to  at december   which decreased the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans from at december   to at december  the amount of the allowance allocated to impaired loans at year end was  which was down from the  at year end the amount of the allowance allocated to specific pools of loans based on risk ratings also declined in this decrease was a result of the reduction in the volume of criticized and classified loans  which did not have specific allocations  from the end of to the end of the impairment process is described in the critical accounting policies section of this annual report 
while the allowance decreased in  it has increased significantly since the recession began in contributing to the increase in the allowance for loan losses over this period is the significant decrease in real estate values experienced in the current economic cycle 
management believes the current level of the all is sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
management continues to monitor the loan portfolio closely and believes the provision for loan losses is directionally consistent with the changes in the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio from to the bank does not originate or purchase sub prime loans for its portfolio 
management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effects of the slumping housing market conditions and any signs of further deterioration in credit quality on the bank s loan portfolio 
management believes the current economic strains will continue into and expects continuing higher than normal credit losses and provisioning expense in the foreseeable future 
monitoring loan quality and maintaining an adequate allowance is an ongoing process overseen by senior management and the loan review function 
on at least a quarterly basis  a formal analysis of the adequacy of the all is prepared and reviewed by management and the board of directors 
this analysis serves as a point in time assessment of the level of the all and serves as a basis for provisions for loan losses 
the loan quality monitoring process includes assigning loan grades and the use of a watch list to identify loans of concern

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the bank enters into certain contractual obligations in the ordinary course of operations 
table presents  as of december   the bank s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
the required payments under these contracts represent future cash requirements of the bank 
the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient 
table contractual obligations dollars in thousands maturity by period total less than year years years more than years certificates of deposit    fhlb advances    subordinated debentures   other notes payable northern kentucky university arena naming rights  gateway community and technical college naming rights executive pension plan lease commitments    total      lease commitments represent the total minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases 
in order to meet the financing needs of its customers  the bank is also a party to certain financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in bkfc s consolidated balance sheets 
table presents  as of december   the bank s significant off balance sheet commitments 
table significant off balance sheet commitments in thousands maturity by period total less than year years years more than years unused lines of credit and loan commitments   standby letters of credit    fhlb letters of credit   unused lines of credit and loan commitments assure a borrower of financing for a specified period of time at a specified rate 
the risk to the bank under such commitments is limited to the terms of the contracts 
for example  the bank may not be obligated to advance funds if the customer s financial condition deteriorates or if the customer fails to meet specific covenants 
an approved  but unfunded  loan commitment represents a potential credit risk once the funds are advanced to the customer 
the unused lines of credit and loan commitments also represent a future cash requirement  but this cash requirement will be limited since many commitments are expected to expire or only be used partially 
standby letters of credit represent commitments by the bank to repay a third party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay a loan or debt instrument 
the terms and risk of loss involved in issuing standby letters of credit are similar to those involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
in addition to credit risk  the letters of credit could present an immediate cash requirement if the obligations require funding 
the bank maintains letters of credit from the fhlb to collateralize public funds deposits 
these letters of credit reduce the bank s available borrowing line at the fhlb 
on march   the bank entered into an agreement with northern kentucky university the university whereby the university granted to the bank the naming rights for the new northern kentucky university arena constructed on the campus of the university for a term commencing immediately upon execution of the agreement and expiring twenty years after the opening of the arena 
in consideration therefore  the bank paid the lesser of of the total construction cost of the arena or  such sum to be paid in seven equal annual installments beginning after substantial completion and opening of the arena 
the cost of the naming rights will be amortized over the life of the contract commencing on the opening of the arena  which took place in september on november   the bank entered into an agreement with gateway community and technical college whereby the college granted to the bank the naming rights for its new classroom and training center located in boone county  kentucky 
the bank committed  to the project  which will be named the bank of kentucky classroom and training center 
the cost of the naming rights will be amortized over a twenty year period commencing at the time when the building is officially named  which is expected to take place in further discussion of the bank s contractual obligations and off balance sheet activities is included in note of bkfc s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the availability of sufficient levels of cash to fund bkfc s operations  such as meeting deposit withdrawals  funding loan commitments  paying expenses  meeting its quarterly payment obligations under certain subordinated debentures issued by bkfc in connection with the issuance of floating rate redeemable trust preferred securities issued by bkfc s unconsolidated trust subsidiary 
the source of the funds for bkfc s debt obligations is dependent on the bank 
during  as discussed in the financial condition section of this annual report  the growth in securities and loans were funded by the growth in deposits 
at december   the bank s customers had available  in unused lines and letters of credit  and the bank has further extended loan commitments totaling  historically  many such commitments have expired without being drawn and  accordingly  do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
in bkfc filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s that was declared effective in november  this registration statement permits bkfc to engage in offerings of up to million aggregate principal amount of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  purchase contracts  units  warrants  rights and any combination of the foregoing 
bkfc utilized the shelf registration to offer common stock in connection with the million common stock offering completed in november  as of the date of this annual report  million of unused capacity remains available for future use 
we may in the future utilize the unused portion of our existing shelf registration statement  or any future registration statements that we may file with the sec  to conduct subsequent registered debt or equity offerings 
if needed  the bank has the ability to borrow term and overnight funds from the fhlb or other financial intermediaries 
further  the bank also has  of securities designated as available for sale and an additional  of held to maturity securities that mature within one year that can serve as sources of funds 
management is satisfied that bkfc s liquidity is sufficient at december  to meet known and potential obligations 
as illustrated in bkfc s statement of cash flows  the net change in cash and cash equivalents from as compared to was an increase of  net income provided  of the  in the bank s cash flows from operating activities  while the largest cash outflow from investing activities was in the form of an increase in loans of  as discussed in the financial condition section of this annual report  the largest source of cash from financing activities came from the increase in deposits 
both bkfc and the bank are required to comply with capital requirements promulgated by their primary regulators 
these regulations and other regulatory requirements limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank to bkfc and by bkfc to its shareholders 
in  bkfc paid cash dividends of per share totaling  on common stock

effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
adoption of new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended existing guidance for testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amendment permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then no further action is required 
however  after the same assessment  if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then a quantitative impairment test should be performed whereby the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is compared to the carrying amount 
the amendments in this guidance are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
the effect of adopting this standard did not have a material effect on bkfc s operating results or financial condition 
in september  the fasb amended existing guidance for goodwill impairment testing 
the amendment permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing these events or circumstances  it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
the amendments in this guidance are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the effect of adopting this standard did not have a material effect on bkfc s operating results or financial condition 
in june  the fasb amended existing guidance and eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the amendment requires that comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements 
this update became effective for bkfc for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and did not have a material effect on bkfc s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  fasb issued an amendment to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us and international accounting principles 
overall  the guidance is consistent with existing us accounting principles  however  there are some amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this update became effective for bkfc for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and did not have a material effect on bkfc s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to interest rate risk  exchange rate risk  equity price risk or commodity price risk 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument and is not currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  equity price risk or commodity price risk 
the bank s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the bank utilizes an earnings simulation model to measure and define the amount of interest rate risk it assumes 
interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a decline in fair market values 
interest rate risk results from the fact that the interest sensitive assets and liabilities can adjust their rates at different times and by different amounts 
the goal of asset liability management is to maintain a high  yet stable  net interest margin and to manage the effect that changes in market interest rates will have on net interest income 
a common measure of interest rate risk is interest rate gap measurement 
the gap is the difference  in dollars  between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that will reprice within a certain time frame 
repricing can occur when an asset or liability matures or  if an adjustable rate instrument  when it can be adjusted 
typically  the measurement will focus on the interest rate gap position over the next months 
an institution is said to have a negative gap position when more interest bearing liabilities reprice within a certain period than interest earning assets  and a positive gap position when more interest earning assets reprice than interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate gap is considered an indicator of the effect that changing rates may have on net interest income 
generally  an institution with a negative gap will benefit from declining market interest rates and be negatively impacted by rising interest rates 
the bank currently is in a negative gap position    and as a result would  without considering other factors  generally benefit from lower rates and be negatively impacted by higher interest rates 
the ability to benefit from the bank s liability sensitive position would depend on a number of factors  including the competitive pressures on consumer deposit and loan pricing  the movement of certain deposit rate indices in relationship to asset rate indices  and the extent of the decrease in the rate environment 
at december   bkfc s month interest rate gap position  as measured by the bank s asset liability model  was negative 
over the preceding months  interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeded interest rate sensitive assets by  of total assets 
at december   interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeded interest rate sensitive assets by  of total assets 
the bank s asset liability management policy establishes guidelines governing the amount of interest income at risk  market value at risk and parameters for the gap position 
management continually monitors these risks through the use of gap analysis and the earnings simulation model 
the simulation model is used to estimate and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on earnings and market value 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the assumptions used in the simulation are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income 
the results of the model are used by management to approximate the results of rate changes and do not indicate actual expected results 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in various management strategies and market conditions 
additionally  actual results can differ materially from the model if interest rates do not move equally across the yield curve 
the changes in the estimates of an increasing rate scenario on the net interest income change  as shown below  from to were a result of the same influences that increased the liability sensitivity of bkfc s gap position and show that risk to income from rate changes would be negative in a rising rate environment 
although the gap position is negative  or in a liability sensitive position  the results of the simulation show income would also decline in a falling rate environment 
the effects of the estimates for a decreasing rate environment are the results of the current rate environment 
in december of  the frb lowered the targeted federal funds rate to  and as a result most short term deposit interest rates cannot drop basis points while earning assets could in theory decrease by these amounts 
the result of this extreme low rate environment is a declining rate scenario which produces a negative impact on earnings
