energy and weather related risk energy and risk management operations we regularly transact in certain derivative based risk management products primarily to address weather and energy risks and engage in hedging and trading activities related to these risks 
the trading markets for these derivatives are generally linked to energy and agriculture commodities  weather and other natural phenomena 
the unit which conducts these activities also transacts business which contemplates the physical delivery of energy related commodities  including natural gas 
currently  a significant percentage of our derivative based risk management products are transacted on a dual trigger basis combining weather or other natural phenomenon  with prices for commodities or securities related to energy or agriculture 
the fair value of these contracts is obtained through the use of quoted market prices  or in the absence of such quoted prices  industry or internal valuation models 
generally  our current portfolio of such derivative contracts is of comparably short duration and such contracts are predominantly seasonal in nature 
over time  we currently expect that our participation in these markets  and the impact of these operations on our financial results  is likely to increase on both an absolute and relative basis 
it is possible the duration of derivative contracts in this portfolio will lengthen in the future 
we use  among other things  var analysis to monitor the risks associated with our energy and weather derivatives trading portfolio 
var is a tool that measures the potential loss that could occur if our trading positions were maintained over a defined period of time  calculated at a given statistical confidence level 
due to the seasonal nature of our energy and weather derivatives trading activities  the var is based on a rolling two season one year holding period assuming no dynamic trading during the holding period 
a confidence level is used for the var analysis 
a confidence level implies that within a one year period  the potential loss in our portfolio is not expected to exceed the var estimate in of the possible modeled outcomes 
in the remaining estimated of the possible outcomes  the anticipated potential loss is expected to be higher than the var figure  and on average substantially higher 
the var model  based on a monte carlo simulation methodology  seeks to take into account correlations between different positions and potential for movements to offset one another within the portfolio 
the expected value of the risk factors in our portfolio is generally obtained from exchange traded futures markets 
for most of the risk factors  the volatility is derived from exchange traded options markets 
for those risk factors for which exchange traded options might not exist  the volatility is based on historical analysis matched to broker quotes from the over the counter market  where available 
the joint distribution of outcomes is based on our estimate of the historical seasonal dependence among the underlying risk factors  scaled to the current market levels 
we then estimate the expected outcomes by applying a monte carlo simulation to these risk factors 
the joint distribution of the simulated risk factors is then filtered through the portfolio positions  and then the distribution of the outcomes is realized 
the th percentile of this distribution is then calculated as the portfolio var 
the major limitation of this methodology is that the market data used to forecast parameters of the model may not be an appropriate proxy of those parameters 
the var methodology uses a number of assumptions  such as i risks are measured under average market conditions  assuming normal distribution of market risk factors  ii future movements in market risk factors follow estimated historical movements  and iii the assessed exposures do not change during the holding period 
there is no guarantee that these assumptions will prove correct 
we expect that  for any given period  our actual results will differ from our assumptions  including with respect to previously estimated potential losses and that such losses could be substantially higher than the estimated var 
at december   the estimated var for our portfolio of energy and weather related derivatives  as described above  calculated at an estimated confidence level  was million million 
the average  low and high amounts calculated by our var analysis during the year ended december  were million  million and million  respectively million  million and million  respectively

equity price risk equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the market value of equities 
as detailed in the table below  we are directly exposed to this risk through our investment in equity investments trading which are traded on nationally recognized stock exchanges  and indirectly exposed to this risk through our investments in private equity partnerships whose exit strategies often depend on the equity markets  certain hedge funds that have net long equity positions  and other ventures  under equity method
