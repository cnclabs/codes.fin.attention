display solutions display driver characteristics 
display drivers deliver defined analog voltages and currents that activate pixels to exhibit images on displays 
the following key characteristics determine display driver performance and end market application resolution and number of channels 
resolution determines the level of detail displayed within an image and is defined by the number of pixels per line multiplied by the number of lines on a display 
for large displays  higher resolution typically requires more display drivers for each panel 
display drivers that have a greater number of channels  however  generally require fewer display drivers for each panel and command a higher selling price per unit 
mobile displays  conversely  are typically single chip solutions designed to deliver a specific resolution 
we cover resolutions ranging from wqvga rgb x to fhd  rgb x 
color depth 
color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a panel 
for example  for tft lcd panels  thousand colors are supported by bit source drivers  million colors are supported by bit source drivers  and billion colors are supported by bit source drivers 
operational voltage 
display drivers are characterized by input and output voltages 
source drivers typically operate at input voltages from to volts and output voltages between and volts 
gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from to volts and output voltages from to volts 
lower input voltage results in lower power consumption and electromagnetic interference  or emi 
gamma curve 
the relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to the pixel by the source driver is referred to as the gamma curve 
the gamma curve of the source driver can correct some imperfections in picture quality in a process generally known as gamma correction 
some advanced display drivers feature up to three independent gamma curves to facilitate this correction 
driver interface 
driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and the display drivers 
display drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger data transfer rate necessary for higher definition images 
the principal types of interface technologies are embedded clock point to point i f  or epi i f  advance intra panel i f  or aipi  mini low voltage differential signaling  or m lvds  ultra slim i f  or usi  and mobile industry processor i f  or mipi package type

for the years ended december   and december   our ten largest customers accounted for and of our net sales  respectively  and we had one customer  lg display  representing and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
substantially all of our sales to lg display are in our display solutions segment and sales to lg display represented and of net sales in our display solutions segment in the years ended december   and december   respectively 
for the year ended december   
table of contents we recorded revenues of million from customers in the united states and million from all foreign countries  of which was from korea  from taiwan  from japan and from china  hong kong and macau 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of million from customers in the united states and million from all foreign countries  of which was from korea  from taiwan  from japan and from china  hong kong and macau 
intellectual property as of december   our portfolio of intellectual property assets included approximately  registered patents and pending patent applications 
approximately  and of our patents and pending patents are novel in that they are not a foreign counterpart of an existing patent or patent application 
because we file patents in multiple jurisdictions  we additionally have approximately  registered and pending patents that relate to identical technical claims in our base patent portfolio 
our patents expire at various times over the next years 
while these patents are in the aggregate important to our competitive position  we do not believe that any single registered or pending patent is material to us 
we have entered into exclusive and non exclusive licenses and development agreements with third parties relating to the use of intellectual property of the third parties in our products and our design processes  including licenses related to embedded memory technology  design tools  process simulation tools  circuit designs and processor cores 
some of these licenses  including our agreements with silicon works co  ltd 
and arm limited  are material to our business and may be terminated prior to the expiration of these licenses by the licensors should we fail to cure any breach under such licenses 
our license with silicon works co  ltd 
relates to our large display drivers and our license from arm limited primarily relates to product lines in our semiconductor manufacturing services business 
the loss of either license could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
additionally  in connection with the original acquisition  sk hynix retained a perpetual license to use the intellectual property that we acquired from sk hynix in the original acquisition 
under this license  sk hynix and its subsidiaries are free to develop products that may incorporate or embody intellectual property developed by us prior to october competition we operate in highly competitive markets characterized by rapid technological change and continually advancing customer requirements 
although no one company competes with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition in each of our market segments 
our competitors include other independent and captive manufacturers and designers of analog and mixed signal integrated circuits including display driver and power management semiconductor devices  as well as companies providing specialty manufacturing services 
we compete based on design experience  manufacturing capabilities  the ability to service customer needs from the design phase through the shipping of a completed product  length of design cycle and quality of technical support and sales personnel 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on internal and external variables  both within and outside of our control 
these variables include the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies  product performance and quality  manufacturing yields  capacity availability  customer service  pricing  industry trends and general economic trends 
employees our worldwide workforce consisted of  employees full and part time as of december   of which were involved in sales  marketing  general and administrative  were in research and development including with advanced degrees  were in quality  reliability and assurance and  were in manufacturing comprised of in engineering and  in operations 
as of december    employees  or approximately of our workforce  were represented by the magnachip semiconductor labor union  which is a member of the federation of korean metal workers trade unions 
we believe our labor relations are good 

table of contents environmental our operations are subject to a variety of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the generation  use  handling  storage and disposal of  and exposure to  hazardous substances including asbestos and waste  soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety 
these laws and regulations are complex  constantly changing and have tended to become more stringent over time 
for example  the korean government s enforcement decree to the framework act on low carbon green growth became effective in april certain designated businesses  including our korean subsidiary  were required to submit plans to reduce greenhouse emissions and energy consumption 
our korean subsidiary set emissions and consumption targets and negotiated an implementation plan in with korean governmental authorities 
each year going forward  our korean subsidiary is required to agree upon emissions and consumption targets with korean governmental authorities and submit an independently verified report of prior year compliance 
there can be no assurance that we have been or will be in compliance with all these laws and regulations  or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these laws and regulations in the future 
the adoption of new environmental  health and safety laws  any failure to comply with new or existing laws or issues relating to hazardous substances could subject us to material liability including substantial fines or penalties  impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon us  curtail our operations or restrict our ability to expand operations 
raw materials we use processes that require specialized raw materials that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers 
tape is one of the process materials required for our display drivers 
we continue to attempt to qualify additional suppliers for our raw materials

risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as a result  the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns that may negatively impact our results of operations 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  these and other factors  together with changes in general economic conditions  cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular 
periods of industry downturns  including the recent economic downturn  have been characterized by diminished demand for end user products  high inventory levels  underutilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience renewed  and possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future as a result of such cyclical changes 
this may reduce our results of operations 
we base our planned operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenue  and a significant portion of our expenses is relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect  we likely will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter  which would harm our operating results for that quarter 
if we fail to develop new products and process technologies or enhance our existing products and services in order to react to rapid technological change and market demands  our business will suffer 
our industry is subject to constant and rapid technological change and product obsolescence as customers and competitors create new and innovative products and technologies 
products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive  and we may not be able to access advanced process technologies  including smaller geometries  or to license or otherwise obtain essential intellectual property required by our customers 
we must develop new products and services and enhance our existing products and services to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements 
we design products for customers who continually require higher performance and functionality at lower costs 
we must  therefore  continue to enhance the performance and functionality of our products 
the development process for these advancements is lengthy and requires us to accurately anticipate technological changes and market trends 
developing and enhancing these products is uncertain and can be time consuming  costly and complex 
if we do not continue to develop and maintain process technologies that are in demand by our semiconductor manufacturing services customers  we may be unable to maintain existing customers or attract new customers 
customer and market requirements can change during the development process 
there is a risk that these developments and enhancements will be late  fail to meet customer or market specifications or not be competitive 
table of contents with products or services from our competitors that offer comparable or superior performance and functionality 
any new products  such as our expanding line of power management solutions  or product or service enhancements  may not be accepted in new or existing markets 
our business will suffer if we fail to develop and introduce new products and services or product and service enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we manufacture our products based on our estimates of customer demand  and if our estimates are incorrect our financial results could be negatively impacted 
we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer demand and expected demand for and success of their products 
the short term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to estimate accurately future customer demand for our products 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in supply  which can challenge our production resources and reduce margins 
we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers increased demand for our products 
conversely  downturns in the semiconductor industry have caused and may in the future cause our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products they order from us 
because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand would decrease our results of operations  including our gross profit 
our customers may cancel their orders  reduce quantities or delay production  which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers may cancel their orders  reduce quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers  which we have experienced as a result of periodic downturns in the semiconductor industry or failure to achieve design wins  have affected and may continue to affect our results of operations adversely 
these risks are exacerbated because many of our products are customized  which hampers our ability to sell excess inventory to the general market 
we may incur charges resulting from the write off of obsolete inventory 
in addition  while we do not obtain long term purchase commitments  we generally agree to the pricing of a particular product over a set period of time 
if we underestimate our costs when determining pricing  our margins and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we depend on high utilization of our manufacturing capacity  a reduction of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and the results of our operations 
an important factor in our success is the extent to which we are able to utilize the available capacity in our fabrication facilities 
as many of our costs are fixed  a reduction in capacity utilization  as well as changes in other factors  such as reduced yield or unfavorable product mix  could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our operating results 
a number of factors and circumstances may reduce utilization rates  including periods of industry overcapacity  low levels of customer orders  operating inefficiencies  mechanical failures and disruption of operations due to expansion or relocation of operations  power interruptions and fire  flood or other natural disasters or calamities 
the potential delays and costs resulting from these steps could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our sales comes from a relatively limited number of customers  the loss of which would adversely affect our financial results 
historically  we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue 
if we were to lose key customers or if customers cease to place orders for our high volume products or services  our financial results would be adversely affected 
for the years ended december   and december   our ten largest customers accounted for and of our net sales  respectively  and we had one 
table of contents customer representing and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
substantially all of our sales to our largest customer are in our display solutions segment and sales to the largest customer represented and of net sales in our display solutions segment in the years ended december   and december   respectively 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  especially our few largest customers  the loss of other major customers or a general curtailment in orders for our high volume products or services within a short period of time would adversely affect our business 
the average selling prices of our semiconductor products have at times declined rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenue and gross profit 
the semiconductor products we develop and sell are subject to rapid declines in average selling prices 
from time to time  we have had to reduce our prices significantly to meet customer requirements  and we may be required to reduce our prices in the future 
this would cause our gross profit to decrease 
our financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  reducing our costs or developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profit 
our industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and includes hundreds of companies  a number of which have achieved substantial market share both within our product categories and end markets 
current and prospective customers for our products and services evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our competitors 
some of our competitors are well established as independent companies and have substantially greater market share and manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources than we do 
we also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in certain of our end markets and with the internal semiconductor design and manufacturing capabilities of many of our significant customers 
we expect to experience continuing competitive pressures in our markets from existing competitors and new entrants 
any consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product offerings and financial resources  further enhancing their competitive position 
our ability to compete will depend on a number of factors  including the following our ability to offer cost effective and high quality products and services on a timely basis using our technologies  our ability to accurately identify and respond to emerging technological trends and demand for product features and performance characteristics  our ability to continue to rapidly introduce new products that are accepted by the market  our ability to adopt or adapt to emerging industry standards  the number and nature of our competitors and competitiveness of their products and services in a given market  entrance of new competitors into our markets  our ability to enter the highly competitive power management market  and our ability to continue to offer in demand semiconductor manufacturing services at competitive prices 
many of these factors are outside of our control 
in the future  our competitors may replace us as a supplier to our existing or potential customers  and our customers may satisfy more of their requirements internally 
as a result  we may experience declining revenues and results of operations 

table of contents changes in demand for consumer electronics in our end markets can impact our results of operations 
demand for our products will depend in part on the demand for various consumer electronics products  in particular  mobile phones and multimedia devices  digital televisions  flat panel displays  mobile pcs and digital cameras  which in turn depends on general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
if our customers fail to introduce new products that employ our products or component parts  demand for our products will suffer 
to the extent that we cannot offset periods of reduced demand that may occur in these markets through greater penetration of these markets or reduction in our production and costs  our sales and gross profit may decline  which would negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to achieve design wins for our semiconductor products  we may lose the opportunity for sales to customers for a significant period of time and be unable to recoup our investments in our products 
we expend considerable resources on winning competitive selection processes  known as design wins  to develop semiconductor products for use in our customers products 
these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures 
we may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures 
once a customer designs a semiconductor into a product  that customer is likely to continue to use the same semiconductor or enhanced versions of that semiconductor from the same supplier across a number of similar and successor products for a lengthy period of time due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier and potentially redesigning the product to incorporate a different semiconductor 
if we fail to achieve an initial design win in a customer s qualification process  we may lose the opportunity for significant sales to that customer for a number of products and for a lengthy period of time 
this may cause us to be unable to recoup our investments in our semiconductor products  which would harm our business 
we have lengthy and expensive design to mass production and manufacturing process development cycles that may cause us to incur significant expenses without realizing meaningful sales  the occurrence of which would harm our business 
the cycle time from the design stage to mass production for some of our products is long and requires the investment of significant resources with many potential customers without any guarantee of sales 
our design to mass production cycle typically begins with a three to twelve month semiconductor development stage and test period followed by a three to twelve month end product qualification period by our customers 
the fairly lengthy front end of our sales cycle creates a risk that we may incur significant expenses but may be unable to realize meaningful sales 
moreover  prior to mass production  customers may decide to cancel their products or change production specifications  resulting in sudden changes in our product specifications  increasing our production time and costs 
failure to meet such specifications may also delay the launch of our products or result in lost sales 
in addition  we collaborate and jointly develop certain process technologies and manufacturing process flows custom to certain of our semiconductor manufacturing services customers 
to the extent that our semiconductor manufacturing services customers fail to achieve market acceptance for their products  we may be unable to recoup our engineering resources commitment and our investment in process technology development  which would harm our business 
research and development investments may not yield profitable and commercially viable product and service offerings and thus will not necessarily result in increases in revenues for us 
we invest significant resources in our research and development 
our research and development efforts  however  may not yield commercially viable products or enhance our semiconductor manufacturing services offerings 
during each stage of research and development there is a substantial risk that we will have to abandon a potential product or service offering that is no longer marketable and in which we have invested significant 
table of contents resources 
in the event we are able to develop viable new products or service offerings  a significant amount of time will have elapsed between our investment in the necessary research and development effort and the receipt of any related revenues 
we face numerous challenges relating to executing our growth strategy  and if we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively  our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
our growth strategy is to leverage our advanced analog and mixed signal technology platform  continue to innovate and deliver new products and services  increase business with existing customers  broaden our customer base  aggressively grow our power business  drive execution excellence and focus on specialty process technologies 
if we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures 
moreover  if our allocation of resources does not correspond with future demand for particular products  we could miss market opportunities and our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations  and changes in the exchange rates of applicable currencies could impact our results of operations 
historically  a portion of our revenues and greater than the majority of our operating expenses and costs of sales have been denominated in non us currencies  principally the korean won  and we expect that this will remain true in the future 
because we report our results of operations in us dollars  changes in the exchange rate between the korean won and the us dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons 
in particular  because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in us dollars relative to korean won  a depreciation in the us dollar relative to the korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues  and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income to appear to decline materially  particularly relative to prior periods 
the converse is true if the us dollar were to appreciate relative to the korean won 
for example  foreign currency fluctuations had a material unfavorable impact on our reported profit margins and operating income from operations for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  as a result of foreign currency fluctuations  it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors  the trading price of our stock or the price of our outstanding senior notes due april  the notes or senior notes could be adversely affected 
from time to time  we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
our korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency option  forward  and zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of us dollar korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
these foreign currency option  forward  and zero cost collar contracts typically require us to sell specified notional amounts in us dollars and provide us the option to sell specified notional amounts in us dollars during successive months to our counterparty in exchange for korean won at specified exchange rates 
obligations under these foreign currency option  forward and zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds 
these option  forward and zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by the counterparty in a number of circumstances  including if our long term debt rating falls below b b or if our total cash and cash equivalents is less than million at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we cannot assure you that any hedging technique we implement will be effective 
if our hedging activities are not effective  changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations 
see part i item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting our results of operations for further details 

table of contents the loss of our key employees would materially adversely affect our business  and we may not be able to attract or retain the technical or management employees necessary to compete in our industry 
our key executives have substantial experience and have made significant contributions to our business  and our continued success is dependent upon the retention of our key management executives  including our chief executive officer and chairman  sang park 
the loss of such key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled technical and managerial personnel 
we do not know whether we will be able to retain all of these employees as we continue to pursue our business strategy 
the loss of the services of key employees  especially our key design and technical personnel  or our inability to retain  attract and motivate qualified design and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this could hinder our research and product development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we encounter future labor problems  we may fail to deliver our products and services in a timely manner  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
as of december    employees  or approximately of our employees  were represented by the magnachip semiconductor labor union  which is a member of the federation of korean metal workers trade unions 
we can offer no assurance that issues with the labor union and other employees will be resolved favorably for us in the future  that we will not experience work stoppages or other labor problems in future years or that we will not incur significant expenses related to such issues 
we may incur costs to engage in future business combinations or strategic investments  and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek to enter into business combinations  investments  joint ventures and other strategic alliances with other companies in order to maintain and grow revenue and market presence as well as to provide us with access to technology  products and services 
any such transaction would be accompanied by risks that may harm our business  such as difficulties in assimilating the operations  personnel and products of an acquired business or in realizing the projected benefits  disruption of our ongoing business  potential increases in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and charges if the acquired company or assets are later determined to be worth less than the amount paid for them in an earlier original acquisition 
in addition  our indebtedness may restrict us from making acquisitions that we may otherwise wish to pursue 
the failure to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields could adversely affect our business 
the manufacture of semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require precision  a highly regulated and sterile environment and specialized equipment 
defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can prevent us from achieving acceptable yields in the manufacture of our products or those of our semiconductor manufacturing services customers  which could lead to higher costs  a loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our products 
slight impurities or defects in the photomasks used to print circuits on a wafer or other factors can cause significant difficulties  particularly in connection with the production of a new product  the adoption of a new manufacturing process or any expansion of our manufacturing capacity and related transitions 
we may also experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields as a result of  among other things  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies 
yields below our target levels can negatively impact our gross profit and may cause us to eliminate underperforming products 
we rely on a number of independent subcontractors and the failure of any of these independent subcontractors to perform as required could adversely affect our operating results 
a substantial portion of our net sales are derived from semiconductor devices assembled in packages or on film 
the packaging and testing of semiconductors require technical skill and specialized equipment 
for the portion of packaging and testing that we outsource  we use subcontractors located in korea  china  philippines  
table of contents malaysia and thailand 
we rely on these subcontractors to package and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
we could be adversely affected by political disorders  labor disruptions  and natural disasters where our subcontractors are located 
if our semiconductor packagers and test service providers experience problems in packaging and testing our semiconductor devices  experience prolonged quality or yield problems or decrease the capacity available to us  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we depend on successful parts and materials procurement for our manufacturing processes  and a shortage or increase in the price of these materials could interrupt our operations and result in a decline of revenues and results of operations 
we procure materials and electronic and mechanical components from international sources and original equipment manufacturers 
we use a wide range of parts and materials in the production of our semiconductors  including silicon  processing chemicals  processing gases  precious metals and electronic and mechanical components  some of which  such as silicon wafers  are specialized raw materials that are generally only available from a limited number of suppliers 
we do not have long term agreements providing for all of these materials  thus  if demand increases or supply decreases for any reason  the costs of our raw materials could significantly increase 
for example  worldwide supplies of silicon wafers  an important raw material for the semiconductors we manufacture  were constrained in recent years due to an increased demand for silicon 
silicon is also a key raw material for solar cells  the demand for which has increased in recent years 
although supplies of silicon have recently improved due to the entrance of additional suppliers and capacity expansion by existing suppliers  we cannot assure you that such supply increases will match demand increases 
if we cannot obtain adequate materials in a timely manner or on favorable terms for the manufacture of our products  revenues and results of operations will decline 
we face warranty claims  product return  litigation and liability risks and the risk of negative publicity if our products fail 
our semiconductors are incorporated into a number of end products  and our business is exposed to product return  warranty and product liability risk and the risk of negative publicity if our products fail 
although we maintain insurance for product liability claims  the amount and scope of our insurance may not be adequate to cover a product liability claim that is asserted against us 
in addition  product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and  in the future  may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  we are exposed to the product liability risk and the risk of negative publicity affecting our customers 
our sales may decline if any of our customers are sued on a product liability claim 
we also may suffer a decline in sales from the negative publicity associated with such a lawsuit or with adverse public perceptions in general regarding our customers products 
further  if our products are delivered with impurities or defects  we could incur additional development  repair or replacement costs  and our credibility and the market s acceptance of our products could be harmed 
we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences as a result of changes in  or differences in the interpretation of  applicable tax laws 
our company organizational structure was created in part based on certain interpretations and conclusions regarding various tax laws  including withholding tax and other tax laws of applicable jurisdictions 
our korean subsidiary  magnachip semiconductor  ltd  or magnachip korea  was granted a limited tax holiday under korean law in october this grant provided for certain tax exemptions for corporate taxes and withholding taxes until december   and for acquisition taxes  property and land use taxes and certain other taxes until december  our interpretations and conclusions regarding tax laws  however  are not binding on any taxing authority and  if these interpretations and conclusions are incorrect  if our business were to be operated in a way that rendered us ineligible for tax exemptions or caused us to become subject to incremental tax  or if the 
table of contents authorities were to change  modify  or have a different interpretation of the relevant tax laws  we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences and the anticipated benefits of our organizational structure could be materially impaired 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and know how  as well as our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we seek to protect our proprietary technologies and know how through the use of patents  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and other security measures 
the process of seeking patent protection takes a long time and is expensive 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from pending or future applications or that  if patents issue  they will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application 
the confidentiality agreements on which we rely to protect these technologies may be breached and may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies 
we cannot assure you that other countries in which we market our services will protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states 
in particular  the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in china  where we derive a significant portion of our net sales  and certain other countries where we derive net sales  are uncertain and still evolving and historically have not protected and may not protect in the future  intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws and enforcement procedures in the united states 
our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we have no means of knowing what patent applications have been filed in the united states until they are published 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we may need to file lawsuits to enforce our patents or intellectual property rights  and we may need to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources 
despite our efforts in bringing or defending lawsuits  we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 
in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they may suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violate the intellectual property rights of others  stop our manufacture  use  sale or importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies  discontinue processes  or obtain licenses to the intellectual property we are found to have infringed 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms  or at all 
the termination of key third party licenses relating to the use of intellectual property in our products and our design processes  such as our agreements with silicon works co  ltd 
and arm limited  would materially and adversely affect our business 
our competitors may develop  patent or gain access to know how and technology similar to our own 
in addition  many of our patents are subject to cross licenses  several of which are with our competitors 
our expenses could increase if sk hynix were unwilling or unable to provide certain services related to our shared facilities with sk hynix  and if sk hynix were to become insolvent  we could lose certain of our leases 
we are party to a land lease and easement agreement with sk hynix pursuant to which we lease the land for our facilities in cheongju  korea 
if this agreement were terminated for any reason  including the insolvency of sk hynix  we would have to renegotiate new lease terms with sk hynix or the new owner of the land 
we 
table of contents cannot assure you that we could negotiate new lease terms on favorable terms or at all 
because we share certain facilities with sk hynix  several services that are essential to our business are provided to us by or through sk hynix under our general service supply agreement with sk hynix 
these services include electricity  bulk gases and de ionized water  campus facilities and housing  wastewater and sewage management  environmental safety and certain utilities and infrastructure support services 
if any of our agreements with sk hynix were terminated or if sk hynix were unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations to us under the terms of these agreements  we would have to procure these services on our own and as a result may experience an increase in our expenses 
we are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could affect our operations or result in significant expenses 
we are subject to requirements of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the generation  use  handling  storage and disposal of  and exposure to  hazardous substances including asbestos and wastes  soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety 
these laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
there can be no assurance that we have been  or will be  in compliance with all such laws and regulations or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these laws and regulations in the future 
the adoption of new environmental  health and safety laws  the failure to comply with new or existing laws  or issues relating to hazardous substances could subject us to material liability including substantial fines or penalties  impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon us  curtail our operations or restrict our ability to expand operations 
our korean subsidiary has been designated as a regulated business under korean environmental law  and such designation could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in april  the korean government s enforcement decree to the framework act on low carbon green growth became effective 
certain designated businesses  including our korean subsidiary  were required to submit plans to reduce greenhouse emissions and energy consumption 
our korean subsidiary first set emissions and consumption targets and negotiated an implementation plan in with korean governmental authorities 
each year going forward  our korean subsidiary is required to agree upon emissions and consumption targets with korean governmental authorities and submit an independently verified report of prior year compliance 
if the targets agreed upon each year with korean governmental authorities requires us to reduce our emissions or energy consumption  we could be subject to additional and potentially costly compliance or remediation expenses  including potentially the installation of equipment and changes in the type of materials we use in manufacturing  that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we may need additional capital in the future  and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may require more capital in the future from equity or debt financings to fund operating expenses  such as research and development costs  finance investments in equipment and infrastructure  acquire complementary businesses and technologies  and respond to competitive pressures and potential strategic opportunities 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new shares we issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
in addition  additional capital may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on favorable terms 
in addition  our indebtedness limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness under certain circumstances 
if we are unable to obtain capital on favorable terms  or if we are unable to obtain capital at all  we may have to reduce our operations or forego opportunities  and this may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our business depends on international customers  suppliers and operations in asia  and as a result we are subject to regulatory  operational  financial and political risks  which could adversely affect our financial results 
we rely on  and expect to continue to rely on  suppliers  subcontractors and operations located primarily in asia 
as a result  we face risks inherent in international operations  such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other market barriers  political  social and economic instability  adverse tax consequences  war  civil disturbances and acts of terrorism  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  extended payment terms and differing labor standards  enforcement of contractual obligations and protection of intellectual property 
these risks may lead to increased costs or decreased revenue growth  or both 
although we do not derive any revenue from  nor sell any products in  north korea  any future increase in tensions between south korea and north korea that may occur  such as an outbreak of military hostilities  would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
you may not be able to bring an action or enforce any judgment obtained in united states courts  or bring an action in any other jurisdiction  against us or our subsidiaries or our directors  officers or independent auditors that are organized or residing in jurisdictions other than the united states 
most of our subsidiaries are organized or incorporated outside of the united states and some of our directors and executive officers as well as our independent auditors are organized or reside outside of the united states 
most of our and our subsidiaries assets are located outside of the united states and in particular  in korea 
accordingly  any judgment obtained in the united states against us or our subsidiaries may not be collectible in the united states 
as a result  it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the united states upon these persons or to enforce against them or us court judgments obtained in the united states that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or of the securities laws of any state of the united states 
in particular  there is doubt as to the enforceability in korea or any other jurisdictions outside the united states  either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of united states courts  of civil liabilities predicated on the federal securities laws of the united states or the securities laws of any state of the united states 
our level of indebtedness is substantial  and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness  which may not be successful 
a decline in the ratings of our existing or future indebtedness may make the terms of any new indebtedness we choose to incur more costly 
as of december   our total indebtedness was million 
our substantial debt could have important consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  and limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt 
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will generate a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal  premium  if any  and interest on our indebtedness 

table of contents the credit ratings assigned to our debt reflect each rating agency s opinion of our ability to make payments on the debt obligations when such payments are due 
the current rating of our senior notes is b by moody s and b by standard and poors  both of which are below investment grade 
a rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
we may experience downgrades in our debt ratings in the future 
any lowering of our debt ratings would adversely impact our ability to raise additional debt financing and increase the cost of any such financing that is obtained 
in the event any ratings downgrades are significant  we may choose not to incur new debt or refinance existing debt if we are unable to incur or refinance such debt at favorable interest rates or on favorable terms 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or if we are unable to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
the indentures governing our notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or be able to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
we are a holding company and will depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding senior notes and other obligations 
each of magnachip semiconductor corporation  magnachip semiconductor sa and magnachip semiconductor sa is a holding company with no independent operations of its own 
our subsidiaries  including our principal manufacturing subsidiary  magnachip korea  own all of our operating businesses 
our subsidiaries will conduct substantially all of the operations necessary to fund payments on our outstanding senior notes  other debt and any other obligations 
our ability to make payments on the senior notes and our other obligations will depend on our subsidiaries cash flow and their payment of funds to us 
our subsidiaries ability to make payments to us will depend on their earnings  covenants contained in our debt agreements including the indenture governing the senior notes and the debt agreements of our subsidiaries  covenants contained in other agreements to which we or our subsidiaries are or may become subject  business and tax considerations  and applicable law  including any restrictions under korean law that may be imposed on magnachip korea that would restrict its ability to make payments on intercompany loans from magnachip semiconductor bv we cannot assure you that the operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make distributions or other payments to us or that any distributions or payments will be adequate to pay principal and interest  and any other payments  on our outstanding senior notes  other debt or any other obligations when due  and the failure to make such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
restrictions on magnachip korea s ability to make payments on its intercompany loans from magnachip semiconductor bv  or on its ability to pay dividends in excess of statutory limitations  could hinder our ability to make payments on our senior notes due we anticipate that payments under our senior notes due will be funded in part by magnachip korea s repayment of its existing loans from magnachip semiconductor bv  with magnachip semiconductor bv using such repayments in turn to repay the loans owed to magnachip semiconductor sa under the korean foreign exchange transaction act  the minister of the ministry of strategy and finance is authorized to 
table of contents temporarily suspend payments in foreign currencies in the event of natural calamities  wars  conflicts of arms  grave and sudden changes in domestic or foreign economic conditions  or other similar situations 
in addition  under the korean commercial code  a korean company is permitted to make a dividend payment in accordance with the provisions in its articles of incorporation out of retained earnings as determined in accordance with the korean commercial code and the generally accepted accounting principles in korea  but no more than twice a year 
if magnachip korea is prevented from making payments under its intercompany loans due to restrictions on payments of foreign currency or if it has an insufficient amount of retained earnings under the korean commercial code to make dividend payments to magnachip semiconductor bv  we may not have sufficient funds to make payments on the senior notes 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains  and our future debt agreements will likely contain  covenants that significantly restrict our operations 
the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes contains  and our future debt agreements will likely contain  numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business 
these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business  may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and may adversely affect the conduct of our current business  including by restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and by limiting our ability to engage in other business activities 
these covenants will place restrictions on our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to  among other things pay dividends  redeem shares or make other distributions with respect to equity interests  make payments with respect to subordinated indebtedness or other restricted payments  incur debt or issue preferred stock  create liens  make certain investments  consolidate  merge or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  taken as a whole  sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets  including equity interests of our subsidiaries  enter into sale leaseback transactions  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
in addition  our future debt agreements will likely contain financial ratios and other financial conditions tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests could be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under such debt agreements 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under such debt agreements  our lenders under such agreements could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
the global downturn and related financial crisis negatively affected our business 
poor economic conditions may negatively affect our future business  results of operations and financial condition 
since  the global downturn and related financial crisis led to slower economic activity  increased unemployment  concerns about inflation and energy costs  decreased business and consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and lower levels of liquidity in many financial markets 
consumers and businesses deferred purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news  which has in turn negatively affected product demand and other related matters 
the global downturn led to reduced customer spending in the semiconductor market and in our target markets  made it difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and caused us and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products 
although recently there have been indications of improved 
table of contents economic conditions generally and in the semiconductor industry specifically  we cannot assure you of the extent to which such conditions will continue to improve or whether the improvement will be sustainable 
if the global economic recovery is not sustained or the global economy experiences another recession  such adverse economic conditions could lead to the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  limit the ability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products  lead to customer insolvencies  and also result in counterparty failures that may negatively impact our treasury operations 
as a result  our business  financial condition and result of operations could be materially adversely affected in future periods as a result of economic downturns 
we have a history of losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
from the time we began operations as a separate entity in until we emerged from reorganization proceedings in  we generated significant net losses and did not generate a profit for a full fiscal year 
we may increase spending and we currently expect to incur higher expenses in each of the next several quarters to support increased research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
these expenditures may not result in increased revenue or an increase in the number of customers immediately or at all 
because many of our expenses are fixed in the short term  or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales 
if we cannot maintain profitability  the value of the enterprise may decline 
we emerged from chapter reorganization proceedings in  because our consolidated financial statements after october reflect fresh start accounting adjustments  our current consolidated financial statements will not be comparable in many respects to our financial information from periods prior to that time 
on june   we filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in order to obtain relief from our debt  which was million as of december  our plan of reorganization became effective on november  in connection with our emergence from the reorganization proceedings  we implemented fresh start accounting in accordance with asc effective from october   which had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
thus  our consolidated financial statements after october will not be comparable in many respects to our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our adoption of fresh start accounting and prior to accounting for the effects of the reorganization proceedings 
investor confidence may be adversely impacted if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures or are unable to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and as a result  the value of our securities could decline 
we are subject to rules adopted by the securities exchange commission  or sec  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sarbanes oxley act  which requires us to include in our annual report on form k our management s report on  and assessment of the effectiveness of  our internal control over financial reporting 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting  there is a risk that we will have material weaknesses in the future 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud 
any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and could result in investigations or sanctions by the sec  the new york stock exchange  or nyse  or other regulatory authorities or in stockholder litigation 
any of these factors ultimately could harm our business and could negatively impact the market price of our securities 
ineffective control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents we are also required to periodically assess and report on the adequacy of our disclosure controls and procedures 
our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported  within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
however  our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
see item a 
controls and procedures 
we may need to incur impairment and other restructuring charges  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial conditions 
during industry downturns and for other reasons  we may need to record impairment or restructuring charges 
from november   the date we emerged from chapter reorganization proceedings  through december   we recognized aggregate restructuring and impairment charges of million  which consisted of million of impairment charges and million of restructuring charges 
in the future  we may need to record additional impairment charges or to further restructure our business or incur additional restructuring charges  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to litigation risks  which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
all industries  including the semiconductor industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit  that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters  most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving customers  employment and labor and intellectual property 
even if the final outcome of these legal claims does not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  defense and settlement costs can be substantial 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the price of our common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or a part of your investment 
the trading price of our common stock might be subject to wide fluctuations 
factors  some of which are beyond our control  that could affect the trading price of our common stock may include actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter or year to year  announcements by us or our competitors of significant agreements  technological innovations or strategic alliances  changes in recommendations or estimates by any securities analysts who follow our securities  addition or loss of significant customers  recruitment or departure of key personnel  changes in economic performance or market valuations of competing companies in our industry  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  
table of contents market conditions in our industry  end markets and the economy as a whole  subsequent sales of stock and other financings  and litigation  legislation  regulation or technological developments that adversely affect our business 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against the public company 
regardless of its outcome  this type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and a likely diversion of our management s attention 
you may not receive a positive return on your investment when you sell your shares  and you could lose some or the entire amount of your investment 
significant ownership of our common stock by certain stockholders could adversely affect our other stockholders 
based upon the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of december   our executive officers  directors and avenue collectively beneficially owned approximately of our common stock  excluding shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants  and of our common stock  including shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants that are exercisable within sixty days of december  in addition  affiliates of avenue currently have two employees serving as members of our seven member board of directors 
therefore  avenue will continue to have significant influence over our affairs for the foreseeable future  including influence over the election of directors and significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets 
on february   avenue completed the sale of  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering  after which avenue beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
our concentration of ownership may limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and  as a result  we may take actions that our public stockholders do not view as beneficial 
for example  our concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock 
in addition  prior to may   we were a controlled company for purposes of the nyse listing requirements  and have been exempt from certain nyse corporate governance requirements that our board of directors meet the standards of independence established by those corporate governance requirements and exempt from the requirements that we have separate compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees made up entirely of directors who meet such independence standards 
we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the nyse rules and will no longer be entitled to the benefits described above after may under our certificate of incorporation  our non employee directors and non employee holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock do not have a duty to refrain from engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar activities or lines of business as those engaged in by us  our subsidiaries and other related parties 
also  we have renounced any interest or expectancy in such business opportunities even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted an opportunity to do so 
future sales of significant amounts of our common stock could negatively affect our stock price  even if our business is doing well 
as of december   avenue beneficially owned  shares  or approximately  of our outstanding common stock  including  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants that are exercisable within sixty days of december  on february   avenue completed the sale of  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering  and as of such date  after giving effect to the offering  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
all of our 
table of contents currently outstanding shares that were issued pursuant to section of the us bankruptcy code  including avenue s shares  are eligible for sale from time to time under rule or section of the securities act subject only to the limitations on affiliate sales 
additionally  all remaining shares beneficially owned by avenue are registered for resale under an effective shelf registration statement and therefore are eligible for sale at any time or from time to time by avenue 
if any of our current stockholders  including avenue  sells or is perceived by the market as intending to sell substantial amounts of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us and could depress the price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
among other things  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize our board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine  divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year  permit directors to be removed only for cause by a majority vote  prohibit action by written consent of our stockholders  prohibit any person other than our board of directors  the chairman of our board of directors  our chief executive officer or holders of at least of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to call a special meeting of our stockholders  and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations 
in addition we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  or dgcl  regulating corporate takeovers and which has an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors  including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock 
in general  those provisions prohibit a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless the transaction is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that status  upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  the interested stockholder owned at least of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced  or on or after such date  the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders  and not by written consent  by at least two thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder 
in general  dgcl section defines a business combination to include the following any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder  any sale  transfer  pledge or other disposition of or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder  subject to certain exceptions  any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder  
table of contents any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder  or the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans  advances  guarantees  pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation 
in general  dgcl section defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by any such entity or person 
a delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders 
however  we have not opted out of  and do not currently intend to opt out of  this provision 
we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future  and therefore  investors should rely on sales of their common stock as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments 
we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the payment of cash dividends on common stock is restricted under the terms of the indenture for our senior notes 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
accordingly  investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a korea based designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed signal semiconductor products for high volume consumer applications 
we believe we have one of the broadest and deepest analog and mixed signal semiconductor technology platforms in the industry  supported by our year operating history  large portfolio of approximately  registered novel patents and pending novel patent applications and extensive engineering and manufacturing process expertise 
our business is comprised of three key segments display solutions  power solutions and semiconductor manufacturing services 
our display solutions products include display drivers that cover a wide range of flat panel displays and multimedia devices 
our power solutions products include discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in high volume consumer applications 
our semiconductor manufacturing services segment provides specialty analog and mixed signal foundry services for fabless semiconductor companies that serve the consumer  computing and wireless end markets 
our wide variety of analog and mixed signal semiconductor products and manufacturing services combined with our deep technology platform allows us to address multiple high growth end markets and to rapidly develop and introduce new products and services in response to market demands 
our substantial manufacturing operations in korea and design center in korea place us at the core of the global consumer electronics supply chain 
we believe this enables us to quickly and efficiently respond to our customers needs and allows us to better service and capture additional demand from existing and new customers 
to maintain and increase our profitability  we must accurately forecast trends in demand for consumer electronics products that incorporate semiconductor products we produce 
we must understand our customers needs as well as the likely end market trends and demand in the markets they serve 
we must balance the likely manufacturing utilization demand of our product businesses and foundry business to optimize our facilities utilization 
we must also invest in relevant research and development activities and manufacturing capacity and purchase necessary materials on a timely basis to meet our customers demand while maintaining our target margins and cash flow 
the semiconductor markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
the prices of our products tend to decrease regularly over their useful lives  and such price decreases can be significant as new generations of products are introduced by us or our competitors 
we strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through cost reductions and the introduction of new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products 
in addition  we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to mitigate the risk of losses from product obsolescence 
demand for our products and services is driven primarily by overall demand for consumer electronics products and can be adversely affected by periods of weak consumer spending or by market share losses by our customers 
to mitigate the impact of market volatility on our business  we seek to address market segments and geographies with higher growth rates than the overall consumer electronics industry 
we expect to derive a meaningful portion of our growth from growing demand in such markets 
we also expect that new competitors will emerge in these markets that may place increased pressure on the pricing for our products and services  but we believe that we will be able to successfully compete based upon our higher quality products and services and that the impact from the increased competition will be more than offset by increased demand arising from such markets 
further  we believe we are well positioned competitively as a result of our long operating history  existing manufacturing capacity and our korea based operations 

table of contents within our display solutions and power solutions segments  net sales are driven by design wins in which we or another company is selected by an electronics oem or other potential customer to supply its demand for a particular product 
a customer will often have more than one supplier designed in to multi source components for a particular product line 
once designed in  we often specify the pricing of a particular product for a set period of time  with periodic discussions and renegotiations of pricing with our customers 
in any given period  our net sales depend heavily upon the end market demand for the goods in which our products are used  the inventory levels maintained by our customers and in some cases  allocation of demand for components for a particular product among selected qualified suppliers 
within the semiconductor manufacturing services business  net sales are driven by customers decisions on which manufacturing services provider to use for a particular product 
most of our semiconductor manufacturing services customers are fabless and depend upon service providers like us to manufacture their products 
a customer will often have more than one supplier of manufacturing services  however  they tend to allocate a majority of manufacturing volume to one of their suppliers 
we strive to be the primary supplier of manufacturing services to our customers 
once selected as a primary supplier  we often specify the pricing of a particular service on a per wafer basis for a set period of time  with periodic discussions and renegotiations of pricing with our customers 
in any given period  our net sales depend heavily upon the end market demand for the goods in which the products we manufacture for customers are used  the inventory levels maintained by our customers and in some cases  allocation of demand for manufacturing services among selected qualified suppliers 
in contrast to fabless semiconductor companies  our internal manufacturing capacity provides us with greater control over manufacturing costs and the ability to implement process and production improvements which can favorably impact gross profit margins 
our internal manufacturing capacity also allows for better control over delivery schedules  improved consistency over product quality and reliability and improved ability to protect intellectual property from misappropriation 
however  having internal manufacturing capacity exposes us to the risk of under utilization of manufacturing capacity which results in lower gross profit margins  particularly during downturns in the semiconductor industry 
our products and services require investments in capital equipment 
analog and mixed signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by the design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment 
these processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs 
for example  some of our products use high voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years  if at all 
additionally  the performance of many of our products is not necessarily dependent on geometry 
as a result  our manufacturing base and strategy does not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment  allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments 
generally  incremental capacity expansions in our segment of the market result in more moderate industry capacity expansion as compared to leading edge processes 
as a result  this market  and we  specifically  are less likely to experience significant industry overcapacity  which can cause product prices to plunge dramatically 
in general  we seek to invest in manufacturing capacity that can be used for multiple high value applications over an extended period of time 
we believe this capital investment strategy enables us to optimize our capital investments and facilitates deeper and more diversified product and service offerings 
our success going forward will depend upon our ability to adapt to future challenges such as the emergence of new competitors for our products and services or the consolidation of current competitors 
additionally  we must innovate to remain ahead of  or at least rapidly adapt to  technological breakthroughs that may lead to a significant change in the technology necessary to deliver our products and services 
we believe that our established relationships and close collaboration with leading customers enhance our visibility into new product opportunities  market and technology trends and improve our ability to meet these challenges successfully 
in our semiconductor manufacturing services business  we strive to maintain competitiveness and our position as a primary manufacturing services provider to our customers by offering high value added  unique processes  high flexibility and excellent service

additional business metrics evaluated by management adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income we use the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income throughout this report 
adjusted ebitda  as we define it  is a non gaap measure 
we define adjusted ebitda for the periods indicated as net income

we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance because adjusted ebitda eliminates the impact of a number of items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance  we believe that adjusted ebitda is an enterprise level performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in our industry  our investor and analyst presentations include adjusted ebitda  and we believe that adjusted ebitda provides investors with a more consistent measurement of period to period performance of our core operations  as well as a comparison of our operating performance to companies in our industry 
we use adjusted ebitda in a number of ways  including for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  to evaluate the effectiveness of our enterprise level business strategies  in communications with our board of directors concerning our consolidated financial performance  and in certain of our compensation plans as a performance measure for determining incentive compensation payments 
we present adjusted net income for a number of reasons  including we use adjusted net income in communications with our board of directors concerning our consolidated financial performance  we believe that adjusted net income is an enterprise level performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in our industry  and our investor and analyst presentations will include adjusted net income 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are not measures defined in accordance with gaap and should not be construed as an alternative to operating income  cash flows from operating activities or net income loss  as determined in accordance with gaap

factors affecting our results of operations net sales 
we derive a majority of our sales net of sales returns and allowances from three reportable segments display solutions  power solutions and semiconductor manufacturing services 
our product inventory is primarily located in korea and is available for drop shipment globally 
outside of korea  we maintain limited product inventory  and our sales representatives generally relay orders to our factories in korea for fulfillment 
we have strategically located our sales and technical support offices near concentrations of major customers 
our sales offices are located in hong kong  japan  korea  taiwan  china and the united states 
our network of authorized agents and distributors consists of agents in the united states and europe and distributors and agents in the asia pacific region 
our net sales from all other consist principally of rental income and the disposal of waste materials 
we recognize revenue when risk and reward of ownership passes to the customer either upon shipment  upon product delivery at the customer s location or upon customer acceptance  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
for the years ended december  and  we sold products to over and customers  respectively  and our net sales to our ten largest customers represented and of our net sales  respectively 
we have a combined production capacity of over  eight inch equivalent semiconductor wafers per month 
we believe our large scale  cost effective fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly adjust our production levels to meet shifts in demand by our end customers 
gross profit 
our overall gross profit generally fluctuates as a result of changes in overall sales volumes and in the average selling prices of our products and services 
other factors that influence our gross profit include changes in product mix  the introduction of new products and services and subsequent generations of existing products and services  shifts in the utilization of our manufacturing facilities and the yields achieved by our manufacturing operations  changes in material  labor and other manufacturing costs and variation in depreciation expense 
average selling prices 
average selling prices for our products tend to be highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products 
we strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through our product development activities and by introducing new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products 
in addition  we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to preclude losses from product and productive capacity obsolescence 
material costs 
our cost of sales consists of costs of raw materials  such as silicon wafers  chemicals  gases and tape  packaging supplies  equipment maintenance and depreciation expenses 
we use processes that require specialized raw materials  such as silicon wafers  that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers 
if demand increases or supplies decrease  the costs of our raw materials could significantly increase 
labor costs 
a significant portion of our employees are located in korea 
under korean labor laws  most employees and certain executive officers with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment based on their length of service and rate of pay 
as of december   approximately of our employees were eligible for severance benefits 
depreciation expense 
we periodically evaluate the carrying values of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  as well as the related depreciation periods 
we depreciated 
table of contents our property  plant and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets 
depreciation rates vary from years on buildings to to years for certain equipment and assets 
our evaluation of carrying values is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections 
if our projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of the related long lived assets  the carrying value of the assets is impaired and will be reduced  with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying value is equal to fair value 
prior to july   we depreciated machinery and measurement equipment using the straight line method over to years 
however  based on an evaluation of the appropriateness of depreciable lives including a review of historical usage and an expansion of our power solutions business  we determined that machinery and measurement equipment have a longer life than previously estimated 
as a result  we changed the estimate of depreciable lives for machinery and measurement equipment to to years 
the purpose of this change was to more accurately reflect the productive life of these assets 
in accordance with asc  accounting changes and error corrections  the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis from july  as a result of the change in the estimated life of machinery and measurement equipment  cost of sales was million lower  net income was million higher and net income per diluted share was higher for the year ended december  selling expenses 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force as well as a network of sales agents and representatives to oems  including major branded customers and contract manufacturers  and indirectly through distributors 
selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs for the members of our direct sales force  a network of sales representatives and other costs of distribution 
personnel costs include base salary  benefits and incentive compensation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of the costs of various corporate operations  including finance  legal  human resources and other administrative functions 
these expenses primarily consist of payroll related expenses  consulting and other professional fees and office facility related expenses 
historically  our selling  general and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales  and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
research and development 
the rapid technological change and product obsolescence that characterize our industry require us to make continuous investments in research and development 
product development time frames vary but  in general  we incur research and development costs one to two years before generating sales from the associated new products 
these expenses include personnel costs for members of our engineering workforce  cost of photomasks  silicon wafers and other non recurring engineering charges related to product design 
additionally  we develop base line process technology through experimentation and through the design and use of characterization wafers that help achieve commercially feasible yields for new products 
the majority of research and development expenses are for process development that serves as a common technology platform for all of our product segments 
consequently  we do not allocate these expenses to individual segments 
restructuring and impairment charges 
we evaluate the recoverability of certain long lived assets and in process research and development assets on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in our efforts to improve our overall profitability in future periods  we have closed or otherwise impaired  and may in the future close or impair  facilities that are underutilized and that are no longer aligned with our long term business goals 
interest expense  net 
our interest expense was incurred primarily under our senior notes 
in april  we repaid our term loan with a portion of the proceeds from our sale of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we repurchased million and million of such senior notes in may and september  respectively 
impact of foreign currency exchange rates on reported results of operations 
historically  a portion of our revenues and greater than the majority of our operating expenses and costs of sales have been denominated in 
table of contents non us currencies  principally the korean won  and we expect that this will remain true in the future 
because we report our results of operations in us dollars converted from our us revenues and expenses based on monthly average exchange rates  changes in the exchange rate between the korean won and the us dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons 
in particular  because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in us dollars relative to korean won  depreciation in the us dollar relative to the korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues  and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income loss to appear to decline materially  particularly relative to prior periods 
the converse is true if the us dollar were to appreciate relative to the korean won 
as a result of such foreign currency fluctuations  it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors  the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected 
from time to time  we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
our korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency option  forward and zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of us dollar korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
these foreign currency option  forward and zero cost collar contracts typically require us to sell specified notional amounts in us dollars and provide us the option to sell specified notional amounts in us dollars during successive months to our counterparty in exchange for korean won at specified exchange rates 
obligations under these foreign currency option  forward and zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds 
these option  forward and zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by the counterparty in a number of circumstances  including if our long term debt rating falls below b b or if our total cash and cash equivalents is less than million at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we cannot assure you that any hedging technique we implement will be effective 
if our hedging activities are not effective  changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations 
foreign currency gain or loss 
foreign currency translation gains or losses on transactions by us or our subsidiaries in a currency other than our or our subsidiaries functional currency are included in our statements of operations as a component of other income expense 
a substantial portion of this net foreign currency gain or loss relates to non cash translation gain or loss related to the principal balance of intercompany balances at our korean subsidiary that are denominated in us dollars 
this gain or loss results from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the korean won and us dollar 
income taxes 
we record our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we exercise significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets existing at the period end will be realized in future periods 
in such assessment  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent results of operations 
in the event  we were to determine that it would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would adjust the valuation allowance  which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions  including korea 
significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
the ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result 
capital expenditures 
we invest in manufacturing equipment  software design tools and other tangible and intangible assets for capacity expansion and technology improvement 
capacity expansions and technology 
table of contents improvements typically occur in anticipation of seasonal increases in demand 
we typically pay for capital expenditures in partial installments with portions due on order  delivery and final acceptance 
our capital expenditures include our payments for the purchase of property  plant and equipment as well as payments for the registration of intellectual property rights 
inventories 
we monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and market expectations 
we may be required to take additional charges for quantities in excess of demand  cost in excess of market value and product age 
our analysis may take into consideration historical usage  expected demand  anticipated sales price  new product development schedules  the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products  product age  customer design activity  customer concentration and other factors 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to predict demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels and inventory purchase commitments 
our forecasts for our inventory may differ from actual inventory use 
principles of consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation

we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using adjusted net income only supplementally

interest expenses for the three months ended december  decreased compared to the three months ended september  primarily due to a million repurchase out of million aggregate senior notes then outstanding 
interest expenses remained constant over the four quarters beginning from january  a substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non cash translation gain or loss recorded for intercompany borrowing at our korean subsidiary and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between korean won and the us dollar 
during the three months ended september  and the three months ended june   foreign currency losses were recognized due to the depreciation of the korean won against the us dollar 
during the three months ended march   the three months ended june   the three months ended december   the three months ended march   the three months ended september   and the three months ended december   foreign currency gains have been recognized due to the appreciation of the korean won against the us dollar

liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements are to invest in research and development and capital equipment  to make debt service payments and to fund working capital needs 
we calculate working capital as current assets less current liabilities 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  our cash flows from operations and our financing activities 
although we currently anticipate that these sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and foreseeable future  we may from time to time in the future require or choose to obtain additional financing 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience dilution 
if we need to raise additional funds in the future and are unable to do so or obtain additional financing on unfavorable terms in the future  it is possible we would have to limit certain planned activities including sales and marketing and research and development activities 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  a million increase  compared to million as of december  the increase resulted from million of cash inflow provided by operating activities  which was offset by million of cash outflow used in investing

on october   we announced that our board of directors adopted a stock repurchase program whereby we may  subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors  repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the stock repurchase program began on october  and was scheduled to end on october  unless earlier terminated by our board 
on august   we announced that our board of directors extended our existing stock repurchase program through october   and increased the total amount of common stock we may repurchase by an additional million  subject to applicable legal and contractual restrictions  for a maximum aggregate repurchase amount under the program of up to million 
the stock repurchase program does not require that we purchase a minimum amount of shares of our common stock and may be commenced  suspended  resumed or terminated at any time without notice 
in addition  from time to time  depending on market conditions and other factors  we may  as part of ordinary cash management and treasury functions  repurchase and retire additional outstanding senior notes due  in open market  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
cash flows from operating activities cash inflows generated by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  the net operating cash inflow for the year ended december  reflects our net income of million and non cash adjustments of million  which mainly consisted of gain on foreign currency translation  depreciation and amortization and accrued severance benefits and an increase in net operating assets of million

for the year ended december   capital expenditures were million  a million  or  increase from million in the year ended december  the increase was due to supporting capacity expansion and technology improvements at our fabrication facilities in anticipation of sales growth 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were million  a million  or  increase from million in the year ended december  the increase was due to supporting capacity expansion and technology improvements at our fabrication facilities in anticipation of sales growth 
seasonality our net sales and number of distinct products sold are affected by market variations from quarter to quarter due to business cycles  and resulting product demand  of our customers 
our display solutions business typically experiences demand increases in the third and fourth calendar quarters due to increased holiday demand for the consumer products that serve as the end markets for our products 
during the first quarter  by contrast  consumer products manufacturers generally reduce orders in order to reduce excess inventory remaining from the holiday season 
in our semiconductor manufacturing services business  the supply demand cycle is usually one quarter ahead of the broader semiconductor market due to lead time from wafer input to shipment to our customers  so the demand for these products tends to peak in the third quarter and is slower in the fourth and first quarters 

table of contents contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in millions senior notes operating lease others interest payments as well as million aggregate principal amount outstanding as of december  out of million senior notes originally issued in april  which bear interest at a rate of per annum and mature in assumes constant currency exchange rate for korean won to us dollars of  includes license agreements and other contractual obligations 
the indenture relating to our senior notes due contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to i declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of or purchase or redeem our capital stock or equity interests of our restricted subsidiaries  ii make any principal payment on  or redeem or repurchase  prior to any scheduled repayment  sinking fund payment or maturity  any subordinated indebtedness  iii make certain investments  iv incur additional indebtedness and issue certain types of capital stock  v create or incur any lien except for permitted liens that secures obligations under any indebtedness or related guarantee  vi merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to other companies  vii enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  viii guarantee the payment of any indebtedness  ix enter into sale leaseback transactions  x enter into agreements that would restrict the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to make distributions with respect to their equity  to make loans to us or other restricted subsidiaries or to transfer assets to us or other restricted subsidiaries  and xi designate unrestricted subsidiaries 
we lease equipment for manufacturing and research and development purposes 
these leases are accounted for as capital leases as the ownership of the equipment will be transferred to us upon expiration of the lease terms or we have bargain purchase options at the end of the lease terms 
we lease land  office space and equipment under various operating lease agreements that expire through we follow asc guidance on uncertain tax positions 
our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million as of december  these unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we cannot estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements of magnachip semiconductor corporation for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this report  are critical due to the fact that they involve a high degree of judgment and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and other assumptions and information that we believe to be 
table of contents reasonable 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
accordingly  these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes 
business combination adopting revised accounting guidance for business combinations  we i apply the expanded definition of business and business combination as prescribed by the revised guidance  ii recognize assets acquired  liabilities assumed including goodwill measured at fair value at the acquisition date  iii recognize acquisition related expenses in earnings  and iv capitalize technology and customer relationship at fair value as intangible assets 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable valuation our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of semiconductor products that we design and the manufacture of semiconductor wafers for third parties 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered and title and risk of loss have transferred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon shipment  upon delivery of the product at the customer s location or upon customer acceptance depending on terms of the arrangements  when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
specialty semiconductor manufacturing services are performed pursuant to manufacturing agreements and purchase orders 
standard products are shipped and sold based upon purchase orders from customers 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent across our product lines  marketing venues and all geographic areas 
all amounts billed to a customer related to shipping and handling are classified as sales  while all costs incurred by us for shipping and handling are classified as expenses 
we currently manufacture a substantial portion of our products internally at our wafer fabrication facilities 
in the future  we expect to rely  to some extent  on outside wafer foundries for additional capacity and advanced technologies 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
the establishment of reserves for sales discounts is based on management judgments that require significant estimates of a variety of factors  including forecasted demand  returns and industry pricing assumptions 
sales of accounts receivable we entered into a factoring arrangement with a financial institution under which we transfer certain receivables 
we accounts for transfers of financial assets under asc  transfers and servicing  as either sales or financings 
transfers of financial assets that result in sales accounting are those in which the transfer legally isolates the transferred assets from the transferor  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and no condition both constraints the transferee s right to pledge or exchange the assets and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor  and the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
if the transfer does not meet these criteria  the transfer is accounted for as a financing 
financial assets that are treated as sales are removed from our accounts with any realized gain loss reflected in earning during the period of sale 
accrual of warranty cost we record warranty liabilities for the estimated costs that may be incurred under limited warranties 
our warranties generally cover product defects based on compliance with our specifications and are normally applicable for twelve months from the date of product delivery 
these liabilities are accrued when revenues are 
table of contents recognized 
warranty costs include the costs to replace the defective products 
factors that affect our warranty liability include historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those repairs and the cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligations 
as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations  we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  using the average method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
when there is a difference in the carrying value and the net realizable value the difference is recognized as a loss on valuation of inventories within cost of sales 
we estimate the net realizable value for such finished goods and work in progress based primarily upon the latest invoice prices and current market conditions 
we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary 
while a portion of the reserve is determined based upon the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory 
for example  reserves are established for excess inventory based on inventory levels in excess of six months of projected demand  as judged by management  for each specific product 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
in addition  as prescribed in asc guidance on inventory costs  the cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of each fabrication facility 
if the capacity utilization is lower than a level that management believes to be normal  the fixed overhead costs per production unit which exceed those which would be incurred when the fabrication facilities are running under normal capacity are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories 
long lived assets we assess long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset group s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows  the asset group is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset group s carrying value and its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
impairments of long lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows 
we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings 
additionally  an evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
intangible assets the fair value of our in process research and development  or ipr d  was recorded in connection with fresh start reporting on october  and was determined based on the present value of each research project s projected cash flows using an income approach 
future cash flows are predominately based on the net 
table of contents income forecast of each project  consistent with historical pricing  margins and expense levels of similar products 
revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends and individual project life cycles 
the resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating our weighted average cost of capital 
ipr d is considered an indefinite lived intangible asset and is not subject to amortization 
ipr d assets must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the ipr d asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the ipr d asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the ipr d asset will be its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
the initial determination and subsequent evaluation for impairment of the ipr d asset requires management to make significant judgments and estimates 
once the ipr d projects have been completed  the useful life of the ipr d asset is determined and amortized accordingly 
technology  customer relationships and intellectual property assets are considered definite lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives  ranging from four to ten years 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc guidance addressing accounting for income taxes 
the guidance requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and expiration of tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
we established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets at most of our subsidiaries since  other than with respect to two subsidiaries  it is not probable that a majority of the deferred tax assets will be realizable 
the valuation allowance at these subsidiaries was not established since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at these subsidiaries will be realizable based on the current prospects for their future taxable income 
changes in our evaluation of our deferred income tax assets from period to period could have a significant effect on our net operating results and financial condition 
in addition  beginning january   we account for uncertainties related to income taxes in compliance with asc guidance on uncertain tax positions 
under this guidance  we evaluate our tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition and measurement on our consolidated financial statements 
only those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized on the consolidated financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of ultimately being realized 
assumptions  judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes 
a change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation in  we adopted asc guidance addressing accounting for stock unit based compensation based on a fair value method 
under this guidance  stock unit based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock unit options 
in developing assumptions for fair value calculation under the guidance  we use estimates based on historical data and market information 
a small change in the assumptions used in the estimate can cause a relatively significant change in the fair value calculation 
prior to our initial public offering  the determination of the fair value of our common stock units on each grant date was a two step process 
first  management estimated our enterprise value in consultation with such advisers as we deemed appropriate 
second  this business enterprise value was allocated to all sources of capital invested in us based on each type of security s respective rights and claims to our total business enterprise value 
this allocation included a calculation of the fair value of our common stock units on a non marketable basis 
the business enterprise value was determined based on an income approach and a market approach using the revenue multiples of comparable companies  giving appropriate weight to each approach 
the income approach was based on the discounted cash flow method and an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
cash flow hedges we are exposed to non functional currency denominated cash flow fluctuations in connection with third party sales 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain of these risks 
throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship  but at least quarterly  a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed 
designated components of our derivative instruments gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
in conjunction with our effectiveness testing  we also evaluate ineffectiveness associated with the hedge relationship 
resulting ineffectiveness  if any  is recognized immediately in our consolidated statements of operations 
we record the fair value of our foreign currency derivative contracts qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in our consolidated balance sheet with the effective portion of the related gain or loss on those contracts deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains or losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period in which the underlying hedged sales transactions are recognized and on the same line item as the underlying hedged items 
however  in the event the relationship is no longer effective  we recognize the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument becomes no longer effective immediately in the consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income asu which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  it requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used today  and the second statement would include components of other comprehensive income oci 
asu does not change the items that must be reported in oci

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the market risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market conditions  primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in the normal course of our business  we are subject to market risks associated with interest rate movements and currency movements on our assets and liabilities 
foreign currency exposures we have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net income from our subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than us dollars  as our foreign subsidiaries in korea  taiwan  china  japan and hong kong use local currency as their functional currency 
from time to time these subsidiaries have cash and financial instruments in local currency 
the amounts held in japan  taiwan  hong kong and china are not material in regards to foreign currency movements 
however  based on the cash and financial instruments 
table of contents balance at december  for our korean subsidiary  a devaluation of the korean won against the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease of million in our us dollar financial instruments and cash balances 
based on the japanese yen cash balance at december   a devaluation of the japanese yen against the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease of million in our us dollar cash balance 
interest rate exposures as of december   million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes remained outstanding 
our senior notes are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate changes 
if the market interest rate increases by and all other variables were held constant from their levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of this fixed rate note would decrease by million and we would have additional interest expense costs over the market rate of million on a day basis
