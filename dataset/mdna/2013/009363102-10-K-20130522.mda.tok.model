total organic sales increased  with hardgoods up and gas and rent up 
acquisitions  net of a divestiture  contributed sales growth in the current year 
the company s organic sales growth reflected the impact of continued economic uncertainty and moderation in business conditions on its diversified customer base 
higher pricing contributed to total organic sales growth  more than offsetting the negative impact from volume declines 
the pricing actions were designed to address rising product  operating and distribution costs  as well as to support ongoing investments in production and distribution capabilities and technologies in order to more efficiently and effectively meet the growing demands of the company s customers while fulfilling the safety and security requirements of its industry 
the consolidated gross profit margin excluding depreciation in the current year was  an increase of basis points from the prior year  driven by a sales mix shift toward higher margin gas and rent and by margin expansion on gases and hardgoods 
the company s operating income margin increased to  a basis point improvement over the prior year 
additionally  the current and prior year s operating income margins were burdened by basis points and basis points  respectively  of net special charges 
net earnings per diluted share rose to in the current year versus in the prior year

net special charges in each year consisted of the following years ended march  effect on diluted eps restructuring and other related costs  net impairment charges gain on sale of businesses costs benefits related to unsolicited takeover attempt multi employer pension plan withdrawal charges income tax benefits special charges  net enterprise information system the company continued its phased  multi year rollout of its highly customized sap enterprise information system during the current year  with over of its distribution business segment and all of its regional distribution businesses operating successfully on sap at march  at this stage in the company s phased implementation  each of its four bscs  into which the regional company accounting and administrative functions were consolidated upon converting to sap  are firmly in place 
through march  the company had successfully converted its safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure businesses  as well as all of its regional distribution businesses  to the sap platform 
as with the implementation of any new enterprise information system  the company has experienced distractions and disruptions as its associates learn the new system and processes 
these have not had a material impact to date on the company s financial results or internal controls  and the company will continue to monitor these items carefully going forward 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company realized meaningful economic benefits from more effective management of pricing and discounting practices  as well as from the expansion of its telesales platform  each enabled by sap 
fiscal included per diluted share of sap implementation costs and depreciation expense  net of benefits 
fiscal included per diluted share of sap implementation costs and depreciation expense 
the company previously quantified the economic benefits expected to be achieved through its implementation of sap in three key areas accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform  more effective management of pricing

new divisional alignment and llc formation in may  the company announced the alignment of its then twelve regional distribution companies into four new divisions  and the consolidation of its regional company accounting and certain administrative functions into four newly created bscs

prior to conversion to sap  each of the company s twelve regional distribution companies operated its own accounting and administrative functions 
enabled by the company s conversion to a single information platform across all of its regional distribution businesses as part of the sap implementation  the restructuring allows airgas to more effectively utilize its resources across its regional distribution businesses and form an operating structure to leverage the full benefits of its new sap platform 
as a result of the restructuring plan described above  the company recorded an initial restructuring charge of million during the three months ended june  for severance benefits expected to be paid under the airgas  inc severance pay plan to employees whose jobs were eliminated as a result of the realignment 
during the three months ended december   the company re evaluated its remaining severance liability related to the realignment and  as a result of this analysis  reduced its severance liability by million 
the reduction in the severance liability was driven by fewer than expected individuals meeting the requirements to receive severance benefits 
this reduction was due to the retention of employees through relocation or acceptance of new positions  as well as former associates who chose not to remain with the company through their anticipated separation dates 
offsetting the benefit from the reduction to the severance liability were additional restructuring and other related costs of million for the year ended march   primarily related to transition staffing  legal and other costs associated with the realignment and llc formation

supply constraints and challenges the global industrial gas industry continues to work through supply constraints related to helium 
disruption in crude helium production overseas has been the primary cause of the worldwide helium shortage  aggravated by outages and temporary shutdowns at the federal helium reserve and shutdowns at a major private helium source 
the company procures helium from its primary suppliers under long term supply agreements 
as a result of the helium shortage  however  over the past months the company s suppliers have instituted helium volume allocations  which have limited the company s ability to supply helium to its own customers 
these supply constraints have also forced the company to shed non contract helium customers at times and to allocate its limited helium supply to contract and critical need customers 
to help mitigate the financial impact to airgas  the company has and will continue to explore alternative sources of helium and has instituted product allocations and price increases related to its helium customers at appropriate times 
during fiscal  the company s helium suppliers continued to fall short of their volume commitments under the long term supply agreements 
as such  the company continues to expect some level of supply chain disruption during fiscal and anticipates that the time frame for regaining lost customers and recovering lost sales may be longer 
on march   the us environmental protection agency epa issued a ruling allowing for an increase in the production of refrigerant r in calendar year  rather than reaffirming the further reductions that much of the industry  including the company  had been expecting based on a previously issued no action assurances letter 
r has historically been one of the most commonly used refrigerant gases in air conditioning systems in the us the company expects this ruling to negatively impact its sales volumes and pricing near term as a greater than expected amount of r will be available on the market 
however  the company believes that compliance with the montreal protocol will require a significant step down in r production in calendar year  reinforcing the company s position as an industry leader in the reclamation and distribution of recycled refrigerant products
