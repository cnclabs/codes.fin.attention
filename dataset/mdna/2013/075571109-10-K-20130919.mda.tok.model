critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time the products are received by the customers 
we recognize revenue for store sales at the point at which the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register 
for on line sales  we recognize revenue at the time we estimate the customer receives the product 
we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in transit to the customer 
customers typically receive goods within one week of shipment 
we reflect amounts related to shipping billed to customers in net sales and the related costs in cost of goods sold 
we record retail sales net of sales tax collected from customers at the time of the transaction 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected  we may record additional sales returns in the future 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
discounts offered to customers consist primarily of point of sale markdowns and are recorded at the time of the related sale as a reduction of revenue 
we include the value of points and rewards earned by our loyalty program members as a liability and a reduction of revenue at the time the points and rewards are earned based on historical conversion and redemption rates 
we recognize the associated revenue when the rewards are redeemed or expire 
gift certificates sold are recorded as a liability and we recognize sales revenue when the gift certificate is redeemed 
similarly  customers may receive a store credit in exchange for returned goods 
we carry store credits as a liability until redeemed 
we recognize unredeemed store credits and gift certificates as other income three and four years  respectively  after issuance  which is when management deems redemptions to be remote 
in addition  we sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in our retail store locations  through our on line stores  and through third parties 
we recognize sales revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer 
in addition  we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage  which we estimate is four years 
gift card breakage is included as other income within selling  general and administrative expenses 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income 
however  if the actual rate of redemption for gift certificates  store credits  and gift cards increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we record royalty revenue from product licensees as the greater of the minimum amount guaranteed in the contract or amount sold 
we recognize wholesale licensee revenue from sale of product to international licensee operated bebe stores at the time we estimate the licensee receives shipment 
we exclude these stores from comparable store sales 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based awards to employees as compensation expense  based on the calculated fair value on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires subjective assumptions  which are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
as the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for fiscal  and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  such amount has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
we determine market based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
to ensure that our raw material is properly valued  we age the fabric inventory and record a reserve in accordance with our established policy  which is based on historical experience 
to ensure our finished goods inventory is properly valued  we review the age and turnover of our inventory and record an adjustment if the selling price is estimated to be marked down below cost 
these assumptions can have an impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
we estimate and record shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and balance sheet date based on historic shrinkage trends 
investments 
we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars consisting of federally insured student loan backed securities and insured municipal authority bonds 
as of july   our ars portfolio totaled approximately million  net of a temporary impairment charge of million  classified as available for sale securities 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the uncertainties in the credit markets that began in february have affected our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  the majority of these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid  and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities or at maturity 
maturity dates for these ars range from to with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity 
we also hold short term available for sale securities totaling million at july  that consist of treasury bills and certificates of deposit as well as long term available for sale securities totaling million that consist of ars and treasury bills 
we review our investments for impairment in accordance with guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations and reduces net income for the applicable accounting period 
when evaluating the investments for other than temporary impairment  we estimate the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto  and our intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell  the investment before recovery of the investment s unamortized cost basis 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the issuers of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as planned store closures or poor performing stores  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at a store level 
store assets are reviewed using factors including  but not limited to  the company s future operating plans and projected cash flows 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to that store  compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of a store does not exceed the carrying value of the assets  full or partial impairment may exist 
for impaired assets  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
fair value is based upon discounted future cash flows of the asset using a discount rate commensurate with the risk 
in addition  at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management was able to obtain sufficient historical data which resulted in a change in its assumptions of the retail market for a certain  newer  group of stores 
as such  during fiscal we recorded a million charge for the impairment of store assets 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate  however significant changes from our current future forecasts could result in additional impairment charges 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we are subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other foreign  state and local taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of our tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions 
we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
to the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
we regularly asses the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including recent year s operational results which is objectively verifiable evidence 
as a result of this evaluation  as of july   we concluded that it is more likely than not that the majority of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and therefore we increased our valuation allowance by approximately million in the current fiscal year 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value in may  the fasb issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements 
the new guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured on a net basis and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
additionally  the new guidance expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
the new guidance was effective for us beginning in fiscal  which is july  the disclosure guidance adopted july  did not have a material impact our consolidated financial statements 
other comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued asu  which requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
for public entities  the amendments in asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued an asu that requires enhanced disclosures around the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments do not change the requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income 
the asu requires an entity to present information about significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and their corresponding effects on the respective line items in net income 
the asu is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  and as such  we will adopt the disclosure provisions in the first quarter of fiscal income tax in july  the fasb issued asu to clarify the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
the asu is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  we early adopted this asu  which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations our fiscal year ends on the first saturday on or after june fiscal included weeks  while fiscal and each included weeks 
the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended july  june  july  statement of operating data net sales cost of sales  including production and occupancy gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest and other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision income loss from continuing operations  net of tax loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  occupancy costs and production costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs 
fiscal years ended july  and june  net sales 
net sales from continuing operations decreased to million during the fiscal year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to an decrease in comparable store sales due to a decrease in comparable store traffic as well as a decrease in wholesale sales of million  or 
on line store sales increased during the year 
the increase in e commerce sales was driven by increased sales of both bebe and b bebe brand merchandise 
a significant contributor to our increase in e commerce sales in was the continued movement towards more seamless multi channel capabilities  including increasing our on line assortment and improving on line ordering capabilities in stores 
we believe that bringing website administration in house in the first quarter of has enabled us and will continue to enable us to continue to grow on line sales  although not necessarily at the same rate as in the past given the progress we have already made in this area 
gross margin 
gross margin from continuing operations decreased to million for the fiscal year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin of was lower than the prior year at primarily due to an increase in markdowns coupled with unfavorable occupancy leverage 
gross margin in fiscal also included million in reserves for inventory and fabric under the legacy strategy 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to store impairment and closure costs of million  costs related to executive transitions of million  settlement related expenses of million  and rebranding agency costs of million 
the comparable period of the prior year included million in incentive compensation costs as well as million in store impairment and closure costs 
interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income  net of other expenses  during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the year over year consistency reflected our continued investment in lower yielding tax exempt investments and money market funds 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets 
as a result  our effective tax rate for fiscal is not comparable to the comparable period of the prior year 
in future years  the continuing impact of maintaining a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is expected to result in a near effective tax rate 
fiscal years ended june  and july  net sales 
net sales from continuing operations increased to million during the fiscal year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to a increase in comparable store sales as well as an increase in wholesale sales of million  or 
gross margin 
gross margin from continuing operations increased to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin of was higher than the prior year at primarily due to positive occupancy leverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase in dollars was primarily a result of increases in compensation expenses including incentive compensation 
interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income  net of other expenses  during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the year over year consistency reflected our continued investment in lower yielding tax exempt investments and money market funds 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the higher tax rate in the current year was due to various discrete items  including elective changes to state apportionment factors and the cumulative impact of those changes on the related deferred balances 
discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to discontinue operations of the ph division  allowing us to focus our efforts on improving bebe sales and profitability  expanding internationally and continuing to develop our b bebe business 
we closed ph stores in the first fiscal quarter of and during the second fiscal quarter of  closed the remaining ph stores  converting one store to a b bebe 
the results of the ph stores closed to date  net of income tax benefit  which consists of stores for the fiscal year ended july   have been presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for all periods presented and are as follows fiscal year ended july  in thousands net sales cost of sales  including production and occupancy gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses loss from discontinued operations  before income tax benefit add tax benefit loss from discontinued operations  net of tax benefit seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a higher percentage of its annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year  which includes the holiday selling season  compared to other quarters of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the second quarter of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak during the first and second fiscal quarters 
at july   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand of which were cash and equivalents  approximately million  net of impairment charges of million  were auction rate securities ars  approximately million were treasury bills and approximately million were certificates of deposit 
we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity in the ars to impact our ability to fund our operations in the foreseeable future and believe we have sufficient cash and equivalents to fund ongoing operations 
in addition  we have a revolving line of credit under which we may borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million 
as of july   there were no cash borrowings or trade letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit  and a stand by letter of credit outstanding that totaled million 
during fiscal there were no cash borrowings under the line of credit and to date  no beneficiary has drawn upon the stand by letter of credit 
this credit facility requires us to comply with certain covenants  including amounts for minimum tangible net worth and unencumbered liquid assets  and certain restrictions on making loans and investments 
as of july   we were in compliance with all covenants 
at july   we had cash and cash equivalents of million held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions consisting of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in direct obligations of the government of the united states 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we hold our operating and invested cash in accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
the balances in these accounts exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to invested cash or cash in our operating accounts 
net cash used by provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million from to was primarily due to lower overall net income excluding the deferred tax valuation allowance and a change in working capital 
these changes in working capital of million are primarily related to lower prepaid income tax related to our reported operating loss  lower construction allowances receivable related to timing of store construction as well as increased accounts payable as a result of the timing of our inventory orders 
the change from fiscal to was a result of higher overall net income partially offset by decreased changes in working capital of million from fiscal to fiscal these changes in working capital are primarily related to higher prepaid income tax and higher construction allowances receivable related to timing of store construction as well as increased wholesale receivables as a result of our growth internationally 
net cash provided by investing activities was million versus net cash used by investing activities of million and net cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal from fiscal was a result of increased net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments related to the increased settlement of our ars investments at par 
the change from fiscal to was primarily a result of increased net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments related to the increased settlement of our ars investments at par offset by the purchase of our distribution center for million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal primarily included million related to the opening of new stores  million related to the relocation and expansion of existing stores  million related to investments in management information systems and million related to visual and pre production initiatives 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal primarily included million related to the purchase of our distribution center in benicia  ca and additional improvements  million related to the opening of new stores  million related to the relocation and expansion of existing stores and million related to investments in management information systems 
we opened  and new stores in fiscal  and  respectively  and we expect to open stores in fiscal in fiscal  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million  which will include capital expenditures for new stores  remodels  store expansions  information technology systems and office improvements 
during fiscal  the average bebe and b bebe new store construction costs before tenant allowances were  and the average gross inventory investment per store was  net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash used by financing activities of million was primarily a result of the stock repurchases of million in fiscal net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash used by financing activities of million was primarily a result of the fiscal payout of the special per share dividend declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as stock repurchases of million in fiscal we hold a variety of interest bearing ars consisting of federally insured student loan backed securities and insured municipal authority bonds 
as of july   our ars portfolio totaled approximately million  net of a temporary impairment charge of million  classified as available for sale securities 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the uncertainties in the credit markets that began in february have affected our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  the majority of these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid  and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or at maturity 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity 
we do not intend to sell our remaining ars until we can recover the full principal amount through one of the means described above 
in addition  we do not believe it is more likely than not we would be required to sell our remaining ars until we can recover the full principal amount based on our other sources of liquidity 
we also hold short term available for sale securities totaling million at july  that consist of treasury bills and certificates of deposit as well as long term available for sale securities totaling million that consist of ars and treasury bills 
in november  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
we intend  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  to purchase stock in the open market or through private transactions 
purchases may be increased  decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
the plan does not obligate us to purchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at management s discretion 
in fiscal we repurchased approximately million shares at a weighted average price per share of 
no shares were repurchased during the fiscal year 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  liquidity of our auction rate securities  the size and number of new and expanded stores and or store concepts  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments other than operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet financing 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commitments unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
included in the purchase obligations category above are commitments for inventory purchases  capital expenditures  information technology and professional services 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice  usually to days 
we excluded amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above 
the table above does not include liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits 
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of such liabilities  the table does not include million of income tax  interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as noncurrent liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet as of july  inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
for example  cotton prices rose substantially in fiscal and should this rise continue in fiscal  there will be pressure on our average unit costs and our gross margins will continue to be impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we currently maintain a portfolio of variable interest rate investments consisting of cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term investments consisting of marketable securities and ars 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable and tax exempt instruments 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
marketable securities are classified as trading or available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments are considered short term available for sale securities if the original maturity is between three months and twelve months  or long term investments if the original maturity is greater than twelve months 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  the majority these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we determined the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of july  by reviewing trading activity for similar securities in secondary markets as well as by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our investments in ars 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for liquidity  interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars and recent trading information based on the secondary market 
we have modified our investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments 
the following table lists our cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities at july  fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term available for sale securities weighted average interest rate long term available for sale securities weighted average interest rate total the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose significantly  our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected since we have no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risks we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states  substantially all of which are negotiated and settled in us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we also operate a subsidiary for which the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
assets and liabilities of canada s operations are translated into us dollars at year end rates  while income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year 
the related translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
intercompany settlements are recorded in other income expense at the weighted average exchange rate for the year 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
