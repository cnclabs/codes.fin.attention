additionally  we have distribution agreements covering our north american commercial and us federal government markets with arrow enterprise computing solutions  inc arrow  a subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc  and avnet technology solutions avnet  a subsidiary of avent inc pursuant to these distribution agreements  arrow s and avnet s primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our reseller partners and leveraging their own industry experience 
service providers 
we work with many service providers to ensure that customer data is protected  managed and stored securely while delivering rapid self service access by leveraging the modern data management capabilities in the single platform simpana software to deliver backup  archive  disaster recovery and ediscovery services 
our significant premier partners include bluelock  cerner  illinicloud  kio networks  peak  presilient  rackspace  tenzing  terremark and ubistor 
customers we sell simpana software applications and related services directly to large global enterprises  small and medium sized businesses and government agencies  and indirectly through value added resellers  systems integrators  corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturer partners 
as of march   we had licensed our software applications to approximately  registered customers in a broad range of industries  including banking  insurance and financial services  government  healthcare  pharmaceuticals and medical services  technology  legal  manufacturing  utilities and energy 
sales through our reseller agreement and original equipment manufacturer agreement with dell accounted for approximately of our total revenues for fiscal and for fiscal dell is an original equipment manufacturer and a reseller that purchases software from us for resale to its customers  but is not the end user of our software 
sales generated through our distribution agreement with arrow accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal and in fiscal revenue from sales to the us federal government accounted for less than of our total revenues in both fiscal and fiscal technology our common platform serves as a major differentiator versus our competitors data and information management software products 
our common platform s unique indexing  cataloging  data movement  media 
table of contents management and policy technologies are the source of the performance  scale  management  cost of ownership benefits and seamless interoperability inherent in all of our data and information management software applications 
additional options enable content search  data encryption and auditing features to support data discovery and compliance requirements 
each of these applications shares a common architecture consisting of three core components intelligent agent software  data movement software and command and control software 
these components may be installed on a single host server  or each may be distributed over many servers in a global network 
additionally  the modularity of our software provides deployment flexibility 
the ability to share storage resources across multiple data and information management applications provides easier data and information management and lower total cost of ownership 
we participate in industry standards groups and activities that we believe will have a direct bearing on the data and information management software market 
our software architecture consists of integrated software components that are grouped together to form a commcell 
components of a commcell are as follows one commserve one or more mediaagents one or more idataagents each highly scalable commcell may be configured to reflect a customer s geographic  organizational or application environment 
multiple commcells can be aggregated into a single  centralized view for policy based management across a customer s local or global information technology environment 
commserve 
the commserve acts as the command and control center of the commcell and handles all requests for activity between mediaagent and idataagent components 
the commserve contains the centralized event and job managers and the index catalog 
this database includes information about where data resides  such as the library  media and content of data 
the centralized event manager logs all events  providing unified notification of important events 
the job manager automates and monitors all jobs across the commcell 
mediaagent 
the mediaagent is a media independent module that is responsible for managing the movement of data between the idataagents and the physical storage devices 
our mediaagents communicate with a broad range of storage devices  generating an index for use by each of our software applications 
the mediaagent software supports most storage devices  including automated magnetic tape libraries  tape stackers and loaders  standalone tape drives and magnetic storage devices  magneto optical libraries  virtual tape libraries  dvd ram and cd rw devices 
idataagent 
the idataagent is a software module that resides on the server or other computing device and controls the data being protected  replicated  migrated or archived  often referred to simply as the client software 
idataagents communicate with most open and network file systems and enterprise relational databases and applications  such as microsoft exchange  microsoft sharepoint  notes domino server  groupwise  oracle  informix  sybase  db and sap  to generate application aware indexes pertinent to granular recovery of application objects 
the agent software contains the logic necessary to extract or recover data and send it to or receive it from the mediaagent software 
sales and marketing we sell our simpana data and information management software applications and related services to large global enterprises  small and medium sized businesses  and government agencies 
we sell through our worldwide direct sales force and our global network of distributors  value added resellers  systems integrators  corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturer partners 
as of march   we had employees in sales and marketing 
these employees are primarily located in north america  europe  australia and asia 
we have a variety of marketing programs designed to create brand awareness and market recognition for our product offerings and for sales lead generation 
our marketing efforts include active participation at trade 
table of contents shows  technical conferences and technology seminars  advertising  content development and distribution  public relations  social media  industry analyst relations  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  sales training  and preparation of competitive analyses 
in addition  our strategic partners augment our marketing and sales campaigns through seminars  trade shows and joint public relations and advertising campaigns 
our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in external marketing activities 
research and development our research and development organization is responsible for the design  development  testing and certification of our data and information management software applications 
as of march   we had employees in our research and development group  of which are located in our hyderabad and bangalore development centers in india 
in april  we opened a new product development center in bangalore  india  which increased our existing presence in india 
our engineering efforts support product development across all major operating systems  databases  applications and network storage devices 
a substantial amount of our development effort goes into certification  integration and support of our applications to ensure interoperability with our strategic partners hardware and software products 
we have also made substantial investments in the automation of our product test and quality assurance laboratories 
we spent million on research and development activities in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal competition the data storage management market is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
we currently compete with other providers of data and information management software as well as large storage hardware manufacturers that have developed or acquired their own data and information management software products 
these manufacturers have the resources and capabilities to develop their own data and information management software applications  and many have been making acquisitions and broadening their efforts to include broader data and information management and storage products 
these manufacturers and or our other current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  creating new competitors or alliances 
large operating system and application vendors  including microsoft  have introduced products or functionality that includes some of the same functions offered by our software applications 
in the future  further development by these vendors could cause some features of our software applications to become redundant 
the following are our primary competitors in the data and information management software applications market  each of which has one or more products that compete with a part of or our entire software suite emc ibm symantec the principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality  product performance  product integration  platform coverage  ability to scale  price  worldwide sales infrastructure  global technical support  name recognition and reputation 
the ability of major system vendors to bundle hardware and software solutions is also a significant competitive factor in our industry 
although many of our competitors have greater resources  a larger installed customer base and greater name recognition  we believe we compete favorably on the basis of these competitive factors 
our unique product architecture is one of the primary reasons why we compete so successfully 
whereas other competitive solutions in the market are based on multiple  disparate products  our modular offering is based 
table of contents on a single  unified  underlying code base resulting in favorable efficiencies in functionality  integration  scalability and support 
our focused approach to data and information management and our ability to respond to customer feedback also drives the functionality and features of our products  which we believe lead the industry in terms of performance and usability  as evidenced by numerous industry awards we have received in the past months such as the silver rising star award from the global technology distribution council gtdc in recognition of exceptional us sales growth over the past year through distribution partners and midsize enterprise summit east xcellence awards in the category of best midmarket solution  software 
from a customer perspective  highly integrated products such as ours  which are based on a single  unified  underlying code base  are easier and less expensive to deploy  operate and manage 
this flexibility  in turn  makes it significantly easier to scale our products over a customer s entire it environment 
supporting and enhancing our products is made more efficient due to this single  unified  underlying code base  unlike our competitors who are required to support and enhance multiple  disparate products  most of which are based on differing underlying software codes 
supporting multiple  disparate products places larger demands on our competitors internal human and operational capital 
we believe that simpana software  because of its unique architecture  creates a compelling functional  integration  scalability and support advantage 
we continue to expand our worldwide sales infrastructure and increase our distribution throughout the americas  europe  middle east africa  australia and asia to meet the needs of our business 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources and may have the ability to offer their products at lower prices than ours 
in addition  some of our competitors have greater name recognition than us  which could provide them a competitive advantage at some customers 
some of our competitors also have longer operating histories  have substantially greater technical  sales  marketing and other global resources than we do  as well as a larger installed customer base and broader product offerings  including hardware 
as a result  these competitors can devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products than we can 
intellectual property and proprietary rights our success and ability to compete depend on our continued development and protection of our proprietary software and other technologies 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  as well as contractual provisions  to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
we provide our software to customers pursuant to license agreements that impose restrictions on use 
these license agreements are primarily in the form of shrink wrap or click wrap licenses  which are not negotiated with or signed by our end user customers 
these measures may afford only limited protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights associated with our software 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants involved in product development 
we routinely require our employees  customers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our software  technology or business plans 
as of march   we had issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states  as well as issued patents in foreign countries and pending foreign patent applications 
pending patent applications may receive unfavorable examination and are not guaranteed allowance as issued patents 
we may elect to abandon or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent applications due to patent examination results  economic considerations  strategic concerns or other factors 
we will continue to assess appropriate occasions to seek patent and other intellectual property protection for innovative aspects of our technology that we believe provide us a significant competitive advantage 
despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through patents and license and confidentiality agreements  unauthorized parties may still attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology 
in addition  we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 
if 
table of contents we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights  our business could be negatively impacted 
we currently resell certain software from microsoft  including microsoft sql server  used in conjunction with our software applications pursuant to an independent software vendor royalty license and distribution agreement that we have and plan to continue renewing annually 
we also currently resell certain other software from microsoft  including windows pre installation environment software  used in conjunction with our software applications  pursuant to an agreement with microsoft that expires may  we have entered into and expect to enter into agreements with additional third parties to license their technology for use with our software applications 
some of the products or technologies acquired  licensed or developed by us may incorporate so called open source software and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future 
the use of such open source software may ultimately subject some products to unintended conditions  which may negatively affect our business  financial condition  operating results  cash flow and ability to commercialize our products or technologies 
from time to time  we are participants or members of various industry standard setting organizations or other industry technical organizations 
our participation or membership in such organizations may  in some circumstances  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties regarding our intellectual property under terms established by those organizations  which we may find unfavorable

item a 
risk factors you should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this annual report in evaluating our business and our prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business and financial results could be harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes 
risks related to our business our industry is intensely competitive  and most of our competitors have greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources and larger installed customer bases than we do  which could enable them to compete more effectively than we do 
the data and information management software market is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards  changing customer requirements and frequent new product introductions 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
our primary competitors include emc  ibm and symantec corporation 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality  product integration  platform coverage  ability to scale  price  worldwide sales infrastructure  global technical support  name recognition and reputation 
the ability of major system vendors to bundle hardware and software solutions is also a significant competitive factor in our industry 
if we are unable to address these factors  our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in revenues that could adversely affect our business 
most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we do  as well as larger installed customer bases  greater name recognition and broader product offerings  including hardware 
these competitors can devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products than we can and have the ability to bundle their hardware and software products in a combined offering 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
it is also costly and time consuming to change data and information management systems 
most of our new customers have installed data and information management software  which gives an incumbent competitor an advantage in retaining a customer because it already understands the network infrastructure  user demands and information technology needs of the customer  and also because some customers are reluctant to invest the time and money necessary to change vendors 
our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
if so  new competitors or alliances that include our competitors may emerge that could acquire significant market share 
in addition  large operating system and application vendors  as well as some hardware manufacturers  have introduced products or functionality that includes some of the same functions offered by our software applications 
in the future  further development by these vendors could cause our software applications and services to become redundant  which could seriously harm our sales  results of operations and financial condition 
new competitors entering our markets can have a negative impact on our competitive positioning 
in addition  we expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets 
furthermore  many of our existing 
table of contents competitors are broadening their operating systems platform coverage 
we also expect increased competition from original equipment manufacturers  including those we partner with  and from systems and network management companies  especially those that have historically focused on the mainframe computer market and have been making acquisitions and broadening their efforts to include data and information management and storage products 
we expect that competition will increase as a result of future software industry consolidation 
increased competition could harm our business by causing  among other things  price reductions of our products  reduced profitability and loss of market share 
we rely on indirect sales channels  such as value added resellers  systems integrators  corporate resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers  for the distribution of our software applications  and the failure of these channels to effectively sell our software applications could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
we rely significantly on our value added resellers  systems integrators and corporate resellers  which we collectively refer to as resellers  for the marketing and distribution of our software applications and services 
resellers are our most significant distribution channel 
however  our agreements with resellers are generally not exclusive  are generally renewable annually  typically do not contain minimum sales requirements and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause 
many of our resellers carry software applications that are competitive with ours 
these resellers may give a higher priority to other software applications  including those of our competitors  or may not continue to carry our software applications at all 
if a number of resellers were to discontinue or reduce the sales of our products  or were to promote our competitors products in lieu of our own  it would have a material adverse effect on our future revenues 
events or occurrences of this nature could seriously harm our sales and results of operations 
if we fail to manage our resellers successfully  there may be conflicts between resellers  or they could fail to perform as we anticipate  which could reduce our sales 
in addition  we expect that a portion of our sales growth will depend upon our ability to identify and attract new reseller partners 
our competitors also use reseller arrangements and may be more successful in attracting reseller partners and could enter into exclusive relationships with resellers that make it difficult to expand our reseller network 
any failure on our part to maintain and or expand our network of resellers could impair our ability to grow revenues in the future 
some of our resellers possess significant resources and advanced technical abilities 
these resellers  particularly our corporate resellers  may  either independently or jointly with our competitors  develop and market products and related services that compete with our offerings 
if this were to occur  these resellers might discontinue marketing and distributing our software applications and services 
in addition  these resellers would have an advantage over us when marketing their competing products and related services because of their existing customer relationships 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  we have distribution agreements covering our north american commercial markets and our us federal government market with arrow enterprise computing solutions  inc arrow  a subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc  and avnet technology solutions avnet  a subsidiary of avnet  inc pursuant to these distribution agreements  these distributors primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our reseller partners and leveraging their own industry experience 
many of our north american resellers have been transitioned to either arrow or avnet 
sales through our distribution agreement with arrow accounted for approximately of our total revenues for fiscal and approximately for fiscal arrow accounted for a total of approximately of our accounts receivable balance as of march  as a result of our reseller agreement 
if we were to see an impairment of our receivable balance from arrow  it could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
avnet s total revenue contribution was not material for fiscal and and its accounts receivable balance was not material as of march  if arrow or avnet were to discontinue or reduce the sales of our products or if our agreement with arrow or avnet was terminated  and if we were unable to take back the management of 
table of contents our reseller channel or find another north american distributor to replace arrow or avnet  then it could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues 
sales through dell as a result of our reseller agreement as well as our original equipment manufacturer agreement  which is discussed below  accounted for approximately of total revenues for fiscal and of total revenues for fiscal dell also accounted for a total of approximately of our accounts receivable balance as of march  in recent fiscal quarters  we have begun to shift most of our small and medium business segment transactions to non dell distribution partners as dell is now focused on this segment of the market with their own intellectual property 
as a result  the majority of the revenue that is still transacted through dell comes from add on purchases from our existing install base and from new enterprise software transactions where our sales force is directly involved 
we have also recently begun to take proactive steps to broaden our distribution related to enterprise software transactions 
over time  we believe it is likely that these actions will result in a decline in the percentage of our total revenues transacted through dell 
due to the timing of enterprise software transactions that are currently in our sales and marketing pipeline  there will likely be some fluctuations in the amount of revenue transacted through dell from quarter to quarter 
if we are unable to find additional or existing partners to replace the revenues that were previously transacted through dell  it could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and results of operations 
in addition  if we were to see an impairment of our receivable balance from dell  it could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
our original equipment manufacturer agreements are primarily with dell  hitachi data systems and netapp 
our original equipment manufacturers sell our software applications and in some cases incorporate our data and information management software into systems that they sell 
a material portion of our revenues is generated through these arrangements 
however  we have no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems these original equipment manufacturers ship and they have no obligation to ship systems incorporating our software applications 
they also have no obligation to recommend or offer our software applications exclusively or at all  and they have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time 
these original equipment manufacturers also could choose to develop their own data and information management software internally and incorporate those products into their systems instead of our software applications 
the original equipment manufacturers that we do business with also compete with one another 
if one of our original equipment manufacturer partners views our arrangement with another original equipment manufacturer as competing with its products  it may decide to stop doing business with us 
any material decrease in the volume of sales generated by original equipment manufacturers we do business with  as a result of these factors or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations in future periods 
sales through our original equipment manufacturer agreements accounted for approximately of our total revenues for fiscal and of our total revenues for fiscal we may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes with new software applications and services offerings  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
the markets for our software applications are characterized by rapid technological changes  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of software applications embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software applications obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately predict the lifecycle of our software applications  and they may become obsolete before we receive the amount of revenues that we anticipate from them 
if any of the foregoing events were to occur  our ability to retain or increase market share in the data and information management software market could be materially adversely affected 
we devote significant resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
to be successful  we need to anticipate  develop and introduce new software applications and services on a timely and cost effective basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry 
table of contents standards and that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we may fail to develop and market software applications and services that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards  experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these applications and services or fail to develop applications and services that adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
our failure to develop and market such applications and services on a timely basis  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
volatility in the global economy could adversely impact our continued growth  results of operations and our ability to forecast future business 
as our business has expanded globally  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions 
uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and associated global economic conditions have resulted in volatility in credit  equity  particularly with respect to the ongoing european sovereign debt crisis and potential ramifications of us debt issues and budget concerns 
these global economic conditions can result in slower economic activity  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns 
there has also been increased volatility in foreign exchange markets 
these factors make it difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
in addition  these factors could cause customers to slow or defer spending on our software and services products  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles and negatively affect our results of operations 
if such conditions deteriorate or if the pace of economic recovery is slower or more uneven  our results of operations could be adversely affected  we may not be able to sustain the growth rates we have experienced recently  and we could fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we continue to invest in our business in the asia pacific and europe  middle east  and africa regions 
there are significant risks with overseas investments and growth prospects in these regions 
increased volatility or further declines in the european credit  equity and foreign currency markets could cause delays in or cancellations of european orders 
deterioration of economic conditions in the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable 
in addition  we could experience delays in the payment obligations of our worldwide resellers if they experience weakness in the end user market  which would increase our credit risk exposure and harm our financial condition 
in periods of volatile economic conditions  our exposure to credit risk and payment delinquencies on our accounts receivable significantly increases 
our outstanding accounts receivables are generally not secured 
in addition  our standard terms and conditions permit payment within a specified number of days following the receipt of our product 
due to the recent volatile economic conditions  certain of our customers and resellers have faced or may face liquidity concerns which could result in our customers or resellers not being able to satisfy their payment obligations to us  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables and have not suffered any material losses to date  there can be no assurance such procedures will continue to effectively limit our credit risk and avoid future losses 

table of contents we may experience a decline in revenues or volatility in our quarterly operating results  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we cannot predict our future quarterly revenues or operating results with certainty because of many factors outside of our control 
a significant revenue or profit decline  lowered forecasts or volatility in our operating results could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially 
factors that could affect our revenues and operating results include the following the unpredictability of the timing and magnitude of orders for our software applications  particularly software transactions greater than  in recent fiscal years  a majority of our quarterly revenues were earned and recorded near the end of each quarter  the possibility that our customers may cancel  defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information technology budgets  the possibility that our customers may defer purchases of our software applications in anticipation of new software applications or updates from us or our competitors  the ability of our original equipment manufacturers and resellers to meet their sales objectives  market acceptance of our new applications and enhancements  our ability to control expenses  changes in our pricing and distribution terms or those of our competitors  and the demands on our management  sales force and services infrastructure as a result of the introduction of new software applications or updates 
our expense levels are relatively fixed and are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenues 
if revenue levels fall below our expectations and we are profitable at the time  our net income would decrease because only a small portion of our expenses varies with our revenues 
therefore  any significant decline in revenues for any period could have an immediate adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  our results of operations could be below expectations of public market analysts and investors in future periods  which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we encounter long sales and implementation cycles  particularly for our larger customers  which could have an adverse effect on the size  timing and predictability of our revenues 
potential or existing customers  particularly larger enterprise customers  generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them as to the value of our software and services 
sales of our core software products to these larger customers often require an extensive education and marketing effort 
we could expend significant funds and resources during a sales cycle and ultimately fail to win the customer 
our sales cycle for all of our products and services is subject to significant risks and delays over which we have little or no control  including our customers budgetary constraints  the timing of our customers budget cycles and approval processes  our customers willingness to replace their current software solutions  our need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products and services  and 
table of contents the timing of the expiration of our customers current license agreements or outsourcing agreements for similar services 
if our sales cycles lengthen unexpectedly  they could adversely affect the timing of our revenues or increase costs  which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations 
finally  if we are unsuccessful in closing sales of our products after spending significant funds and management resources  our operating margins and results of operations could be adversely impacted  and the price of our common stock could decline 
we depend on growth in the data and information management software market  and lack of growth or contraction in this market could have a material adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 
demand for data and information management software is linked to growth in the amount of data generated and stored  demand for data retention and management whether as a result of regulatory requirements or otherwise and demand for and adoption of new storage devices and networking technologies 
because our software applications are concentrated within the data and information management software market  if the demand for storage devices  storage software applications  storage capacity or storage networking devices declines  our sales  profitability and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
segments of the computer and software industry have in the past experienced significant economic downturns 
the occurrence of any of these factors in the data and information management software market could materially adversely affect our sales  profitability and financial condition 
furthermore  the data and information management software market is dynamic and evolving 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the number of organizations adopting data and information management software for their computing environments 
the market for data and information management software may not continue to grow at historic rates  or at all 
if this market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
our software applications are complex and may contain undetected errors  which could adversely affect not only our software applications performance but also our reputation and the acceptance of our software applications in the market 
software applications as complex as those we offer contain undetected errors or failures  especially when products are first introduced or new versions are released 
despite extensive testing by us and by our customers  we have in the past discovered errors in our software applications and will do so in the future 
as a result of past discovered errors  we experienced delays and lost revenues while we corrected those software applications 
in addition  customers in the past have brought to our attention bugs in our software created by the customers unique operating environments  which are often characterized by a wide variety of both standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing very difficult and time consuming 
although we have been able to fix these software bugs in the past  we may not always be able to do so 
our software products may also be subject to intentional attacks by viruses that seek to take advantage of these bugs  errors or other weaknesses 
any of these events may result in the loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our software applications and services  which would seriously harm our sales  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we believe that our reputation and name recognition are critical factors in our ability to compete and generate additional sales 
promotion and enhancement of our name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective software applications and services 
the occurrence of errors in our software applications or the detection of bugs by our customers may damage our reputation in the market and our relationships with our existing customers  and as a result  we may be unable to attract or retain customers 
in addition  because our software applications are used to manage data that is often critical to our customers  they may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other  less critical  applications 

table of contents as a result  the licensing and support of our software applications involve the risk of product liability claims 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements vary and may not be effective as a result of existing or future national  federal  state  or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any material product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise wide environments 
in addition  our insurance against product liability may not be adequate to cover all potential claims 
if our customers do not renew their annual maintenance and support agreements for our products or if they do not renew them on terms that are favorable to us  our business might suffer 
most of our maintenance agreements are for a one year term 
as the end of the annual period approaches  we pursue the renewal of the agreement with the customer 
historically  maintenance renewals have represented a significant portion of our total revenue 
because of this characteristic of our business  if our customers choose not to renew their maintenance and support agreements with us on beneficial terms  or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
we develop software applications that interoperate with operating systems and hardware developed by others  and if the developers of those operating systems and hardware do not cooperate with us or we are unable to devote the necessary resources so that our applications interoperate with those systems  our software development efforts may be delayed or foreclosed and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our software applications operate primarily on the windows  unix  linux and novell netware operating systems and the hardware devices of numerous manufacturers 
when new or updated versions of these operating systems and hardware devices are introduced  it is often necessary for us to develop updated versions of our software applications so that they interoperate properly with these systems and devices 
we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or cost effectively  and it is not clear what the relative growth rates of these operating systems and hardware will be 
these development efforts require the cooperation of the developers of the operating systems and hardware  substantial capital investment and the devotion of substantial employee resources 
for some operating systems  we must obtain some proprietary application program interfaces from the owner in order to develop software applications that interoperate with the operating system 
operating system owners have no obligation to assist in these development efforts 
if they do not provide us with assistance or the necessary proprietary application program interfaces on a timely basis  we may experience delays or be unable to expand our software applications into other areas 
we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years  if at all 
developing software is expensive  and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle 
our research and development expenses were million  or of our total revenues in fiscal  million  or of our total revenues in fiscal and million  or of our total revenues in fiscal our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 
however  we may not recognize significant revenues from these investments for several years  if at all 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  sales  services and management personnel 
we rely on our executive officers and senior management to execute our existing 
table of contents business operations and identify and pursue new growth opportunities 
the loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business  and the integration and training of replacement personnel could be time consuming  cause additional disruptions to our business and be unsuccessful 
we do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our employees 
our future success also depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  services and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may fail to retain our key technical  sales  services and management employees or attract or retain other highly qualified technical  sales  services and management personnel in the future 
furthermore  in the past  we have experienced higher levels of turnover in our sales force compared to other employee groups in our company 
increases in the turnover rate of our sales force may affect our ability to generate license revenue growth 
although we have hired replacements in our sales force and are continuing to hire additional sales personnel to grow our business  we sometimes experience lower productivity from newly hired sales personnel for a period up to twelve months 
in addition  we periodically make adjustments to our sales organization in response to a variety of internal and external factors  such as market opportunities  competitive threats  product introductions or enhancements and sales performance 
such adjustments could be temporarily disruptive and result in reduced productivity 
the volatility of our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to attract or retain employees 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified employees across our organization  or conversely  if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions  our personnel costs would be excessive and our business and profitability could be adversely affected 
our international sales and operations are subject to factors that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have significant sales and services operations outside the united states  and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from these operations 
we also plan to continue to expand our international operations 
we generated approximately of our revenues from outside the united states in fiscal and in fiscal accordingly  international sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal expansion of our international operations will require a significant amount of attention from our management and substantial financial resources and might require us to add qualified management in these markets 
in addition to facing risks similar to the risks faced by our domestic operations  our international operations are also subject to risks related to the differing legal  political  social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries  including difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment  including currency exchange controls  difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations  general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate  including seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries  could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries  imposition of  or unexpected adverse changes in  foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur  including those pertaining to export restrictions  privacy and data protection  trade and employment restrictions and intellectual property protections  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  
table of contents competition from local suppliers  greater risk of a failure of our employees to comply with both us and foreign laws  including antitrust regulations  the us foreign corrupt practices act  the uk bribery act of  and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices  costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages  and political unrest  war or acts of terrorism 
our business in emerging markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in those markets 
our overall success in international markets depends  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social and political conditions 
we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 
furthermore  the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may experience fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely impact our results of operations 
our international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies  and this revenue could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
our primary exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro and  to a lesser extent  the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  indian rupee  korean won and singapore dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and could require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive in foreign markets  which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar would result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  although operating expenditures would be lower as well 
historically  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our revenues and operating expenses has not been material  although it may be in the future 
in recent fiscal years  we have selectively hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the balance sheet 
in the future  we may enter into additional foreign currency based hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates on the balance sheet  although there can be no assurances that we will do so 
however  as our international operations grow  or if dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates continue or increase or if our hedging strategies become ineffective  the effect of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates could become material to revenue  operating expenses  and income 
our ability to sell our software applications is highly dependent on the quality of our services offerings  and our failure to offer high quality support and professional services would have a material adverse effect on our sales of software applications and results of operations 
our services include the assessment and design of solutions to meet our customers storage management requirements and the efficient installation and deployment of our software applications based on specified business objectives 
further  once our software applications are deployed  our customers depend on us to resolve issues relating to our software applications 
a high level of service is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our software 
if we or our partners do not effectively install or deploy our applications  or succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post deployment issues  it would adversely affect our ability to sell software products to existing customers and could harm our reputation with prospective customers 
as a result  our failure to maintain high quality support and professional services would have a material adverse effect on our sales of software applications and results of operations 

table of contents a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities  which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 
sales to us and foreign federal  state  and local governmental agency end customers have accounted for a portion of our revenue  and we may in the future increase sales to government entities 
however  government entities have recently announced reductions in  or experienced increased pressure to reduce spending 
in particular  such measures have adversely affected european public sector transactions  and the recent us debt issues and budget concerns may adversely impact future us public sector transactions 
such budgetary constraints or shifts in spending priorities of government entities may adversely affect sales of our products and services to such entities 
in addition  sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks 
selling to government entities can be highly competitive  expensive and time consuming  often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully sell our products to such governmental entity 
government entities may require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements 
government contracts may require the maintenance of certain security clearances for facilities and employees which can entail administrative time and effort possibly resulting in additional costs and delays 
in addition  government demand for our products may be more volatile as they are affected by public sector budgetary cycles  funding authorizations  and the potential for funding reductions or delays  making the time to close such transactions more difficult to predict 
this risk is enhanced as the size of such sales to the government entities increases 
if the use of our products expands to more sensitive  secure or mission critical uses by our government customers  we may be subject to increased scrutiny  potential reputational risk  or potential liability should our products fail to perform as expected or should we not comply with the terms of our government contracts or government contracting requirements 
most of our sales to government entities have been made indirectly through providers that sell our products 
government entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our providers for convenience or due to a default  and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations 
governments routinely audit and investigate government contractors  and we may be subject to such audits and investigations 
if an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  including any misuse of confidential or classified information by our employees  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions 
if we are unable to manage our growth  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  the quality of our products and services and our ability to retain key personnel 
we have experienced periods of growth in recent years 
our revenues increased for fiscal compared to fiscal and also increased for fiscal compared to fiscal the number of our customers increased significantly during these periods 
our growth has placed increased demands on our management and other resources and will continue to do so in the future 
we may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate  manage our expanding operations effectively or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis 
managing our growth effectively will involve  among other things continuing to retain  motivate and manage our existing employees and attract and integrate new employees  continuing to provide a high level of services to an increasing number of customers  maintaining the quality of product and services offerings while controlling our expenses  developing new sales channels that broaden the distribution of our software applications and services  and developing  implementing and improving our operational  financial  accounting and other internal systems and controls on a timely basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain or increase revenues and profitability  the quality of our data and information management software  the 
table of contents quality of our services offerings and our ability to retain key personnel 
these factors could adversely affect our reputation in the market and our ability to generate future sales from new or existing customers 
we may be subject to information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches in data security 
information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders  impeding the shipment of software products  negatively affecting our service offerings  preventing the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results 
information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security could also result in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information as well as damage our reputation 
while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security  internal control measures and developed certain disaster recovery plans  there can be no assurance that a system failure  network disruption or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  and any misuse of our intellectual property by others could materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
our success depends significantly upon proprietary technology in our software  documentation and other written materials 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions 
these methods afford only limited protection 
despite this limited protection  any issued patent may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties  and the patents of others may seriously impede our ability to conduct our business 
further  our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  and any patents issued to us may not be timely or broad enough to protect our proprietary rights 
we may also develop proprietary products or technologies that cannot be protected under patent law 
we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets 
the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties  or by our employees  which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our software applications or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software applications is difficult  and we expect software piracy to continue to be a persistent problem 
in licensing our software applications  we typically rely on shrink wrap or click wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
we may have difficulty enforcing these licenses in some jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our attempts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our software applications or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
in addition  from time to time we are participants or members of various industry standard setting organizations or other industry technical organizations 
our participation or membership in such organizations may  in some circumstances  require us to 
table of contents enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties regarding our intellectual property under terms established by those organizations  which we may not find favorable 
in addition  many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them  which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims  and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims 
furthermore  such customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products  services  and technologies  as a result of injunctions or otherwise  which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business 
claims that we misuse the intellectual property of others could subject us to significant liability and disrupt our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the nature of our business  we may become subject to material claims of infringement by competitors and other third parties with respect to current or future software applications  trademarks or other proprietary rights 
we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of software applications and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of software applications in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties  which may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable  if at all 
in addition  we may decide to settle a claim or action against us  which settlement could be costly 
we may also be liable for any past infringement 
if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit  an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product 
it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or  if there is a finding of willful infringement  treble damages 
any of these claims could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all  and may expose us to additional liability 
this liability  or our inability to use any of this third party software  could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our use of open source software could negatively affect our business and subjects us to possible litigation 
some of the products or technologies acquired  licensed or developed by us may incorporate so called open source software  and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future 
such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses  including  for example  the gnu general public license  the gnu lesser general public license  the common public license  apache style licenses  berkley software distribution or bsd style licenses and other open source licenses 
we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend  but these efforts may not be successful 
although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use  there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses  and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is somewhat unknown and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and technologies 
the use of such open source software may ultimately subject some of our products to unintended conditions  which may negatively affect our business  financial condition  operating results  cash flow and ability to commercialize our products or technologies 
some of these open source licenses may subject us to certain conditions  including requirements that we offer our products that use the open source software for no cost  that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon  incorporating or using the open source software and or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license 
if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses  we could be required to incur significant legal expenses 
table of contents defending against such allegations 
if our defenses were not successful  we could be enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained the open source software and required to make the source code for the open source software available to others  to grant third parties certain rights of further use of our software or to remove the open source software from our products  which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our products 
in addition  if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner  under some open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
if an author or other third party that distributes open source software were to obtain a judgment against us based on allegations that we had not complied with the terms of any such open source licenses  we could also be subject to liability for copyright infringement damages and breach of contract for our past distribution of such open source software 
our effective tax rate is difficult to project  and changes in such tax rate or adverse results of tax examinations could adversely affect our operating results 
we are a united states based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions 
any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict 
the process of determining our anticipated tax liabilities involves many calculations and estimates that are inherently complex and make the ultimate tax obligation determination uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
these estimates involve complex issues  require extended periods of time to resolve  and require us to make judgments  such as anticipating the outcomes of audits with tax authorities and the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns 
furthermore  our overall effective income tax rate and tax expenses may be affected by various factors in our business  including changes in our legal structure  changes in the geographic mix of income and expenses  changes in tax laws and applicable accounting pronouncements and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual profits before income tax 
for example  our effective tax rate has benefited from an existing us research and development tax credit which extends through the end of the calendar year 
if this tax credit is not renewed in the future  we would expect our effective tax rate to increase 
we also determine the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income and other factors in each jurisdiction 
as of march   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million  which were primarily related to federal and state research tax credit carryforwards  stock based compensation and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
consequently  our cash tax rate will be lower than our effective tax rate though fiscal and into fiscal however  we expect our cash taxes to continue to increase as our cash tax rate approaches our effective tax rate 
our cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail 
our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
we maintain the cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions 
deposits with these banks exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets 
to date  we have 
table of contents experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets 
we cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain additional financing  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future in order to acquire complementary businesses  technologies  products or services 
any required additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  you may experience significant dilution of your ownership interest  and the newly issued securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties  the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility  and would also require us to fund additional interest expense 
if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our software and services through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which could have a material adverse effect on our software and services offerings  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
we have no plans  nor are we currently considering any proposals or arrangements  written or otherwise  to acquire a business  technology  product or service 
we may become involved in litigation that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
from time to time  we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business  including patent  commercial  product liability  employment  class action  whistleblower and other litigation and claims  and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
during fiscal  we closed on a purchase of land located in tinton falls  new jersey for our future corporate campus headquarters to support the long term growth of our business 
we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property 
in addition  we are subject to the risks of owning real property including the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning and other legal or regulatory requirements 
furthermore  we are subject to adverse changes in the value of this property due to interest rate changes  changes in the market in which the property is located or other factors 
our estimate for the planned construction of the campus headquarters may increase due to factors outside of our control and could increase the amount of cash committed to this project 
also  if we decide to sell our real property in the future and are not able to recover all capitalized costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we are currently planning and designing information systems enhancements and problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements could interfere with our business and operations 
we are currently in the process of significantly enhancing our information systems  including planning and designing a new enterprise resource planning system 
the implementation of significant enhancements to information systems is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise 
any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements  particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during the design or implementation periods  could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders  ship products  bill and 
table of contents track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business 
if we are unable to successfully plan  design or implement these information systems enhancements  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
risks relating to ownership of our common stock the price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly or annual operating results  changes in financial estimates  treatment of our tax assets or liabilities or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our competitors  the public s response to our press releases  rumors  our other public announcements and our filings with the sec  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance or interpretations or principles  sales of common stock by our directors  officers and significant stockholders  announcements of technological innovations or enhanced or new products by us or our competitors  our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts projections  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us  broad market and industry factors  and other events or factors  including those resulting from war  incidents of terrorism or responses to such events 
the market prices of software companies have been extremely volatile 
stock prices of many software companies have often fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in the past  following periods of market volatility  stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation 
if we were involved in securities litigation  it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of management from our business 
future sales of our common stock  or the perception that such future sales may occur  may cause our stock price to decline and impair our ability to obtain capital through future stock offerings 
a substantial number of shares of our common stock are available for sale into the public market 
the occurrence of such sales  or the perception that such sales could occur  could materially and adversely affect our stock price and could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities 
certain provisions in our charter documents and agreements and delaware law  as well as our stockholder rights plan  may inhibit potential acquisition bids for commvault and prevent changes in our management 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in management that our stockholders might deem advantageous 
specific provisions in our certificate of incorporation include our ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the board of directors may determine  without stockholder approval  
table of contents a classified board in which only a third of the total board members will be elected at each annual stockholder meeting  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  and limitations on convening stockholder meetings 
in addition to the provision described above  on november   our board of directors adopted a stockholders rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock to shareholders of record on november  each right  when exercisable  entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one thousandth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock  par value per share  at a purchase price of per one one thousandth of a share  subject to adjustment 
the rights may discourage a third party from making an unsolicited proposal to acquire us  as exercise of the rights would cause substantial dilution to such third party attempting to acquire us 
as a result of the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our stockholder rights plan  the price investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock may be limited 
also  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our common stock 
further  certain of our employment agreements and incentive plans provide for vesting of stock options and or payments to be made to the employees thereunder if their employment is terminated in connection with a change of control  which could discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price 
we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
consequently  investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 
investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 
although we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis  and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox  and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec to implement sox  we are required to furnish a report in our form k regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments and some of our judgments will be in areas that may be open to interpretation 
although we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate or may not operate effectively 
in future years  if we fail to timely complete this assessment  or if our auditors cannot timely attest  there may be a loss of public confidence in our internal controls  the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or investigations by the nasdaq stock market  the securities and exchange commission or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations 

table of contents during the past few years  our organizational structure has increased in complexity due to compliance with tax regulations and tax accounting requirements and other regulatory and compliance requirements  including compliance with anti corruption and anti bribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and the uk bribery act of the uk bribery act 
further  we have expanded our presence in the asia pacific region  where business practices can differ from those in other regions of the world and can create internal control risks 
we provide business practices training to our employees worldwide 
overall  the combination of increased structural complexity and the ever increasing regulatory complexity make it more critical for us to attract and retain qualified and technically competent employees

overview we are a leading provider of data and information management software applications and related services in terms of product breadth and functionality and market penetration 
we develop  market and sell a unified suite of data and information management software applications under the simpana brand 
simpana software is built from the ground up on a single platform and unified code base for integrated data and information management 
the simpana platform contains licensable modules that work together seamlessly  sharing a single code and common function set to deliver backup and recovery  archive  replication  search and analytic capabilities across physical  virtual and cloud environments 
with a single platform approach  simpana software is specifically designed to protect  manage and access data throughout its lifecycle in less time  at lower cost and with fewer resources than alternative solutions 
our product features and capabilities enable our customers to deploy solutions for data protection  business continuance  corporate compliance and centralized management and reporting 
we also provide our customers with a broad range of professional services that are delivered by our worldwide support and field operations 
as of march   we had licensed our software applications to approximately  registered customers 
history and background in early  we launched commvault galaxy for backup and recovery  a storage industry award winner 
in the years since  commvault has forged numerous alliances with top software application and hardware vendors  such as dell  hp  hitachi data systems  microsoft  network appliance  fujitsu  novell and oracle  to enhance capabilities and to create a premiere suite of data and information management solutions 
in  we launched our single platform technology that provides the foundation of our information management approach to storing  managing  and accessing data 
our simpana software suite is one product that contains the following licensable modules  all built on a single unified code base and platform to protect  manage and access data and information backup and recovery  archive  replication  search  and analyze 
in addition to backup and recovery  the subsequent release of our other software application modules has substantially increased our addressable market 
each application module can be used individually or in combination with other application modules from our single platform suite 
in january  commvault simpana simpana was made available for public release 
simpana included advances in recovery management  data reduction  virtual server protection and content organization 
in addition  we believe that simpana met a broad spectrum of customer s discovery and recovery management requirements and eliminated the need for a myriad of point level products 
in august  our commvault simpana software suite simpana was made available for public release 
we believe that simpana  which built on and significantly expanded simpana  allows customers to deploy a modern data management solution to achieve gains in efficiency  cost optimization and scale 
we believe that simpana solves real world it challenges with major technology advancements  including increased virtualization scalability and performance  integrated source and target data deduplication  automatic and transparent integration with hardware array based snapshots  as well as new tools that ease migration to our next generation simpana platform 

table of contents in january  we released enhancements to our existing simpana software suite 
these enhancements included new capabilities that converges backup  archive and reporting processes  additional snapprotect technology that delivers hardware snapshot integration  enhancements to virtual server protection  new innovations to protect data on laptops and desktops with embedded source deduplication for optimized efficiency  and new integration with microsoft sharepoint 
in february  our commvault simpana software suite simpana was made available for public release 
we believe simpana extends our data protection and archiving leadership to deliver secure  self service access from mobile devices  speed the adoption of cloud computing and extract value from big data 
simpana includes major technology advancements such as enhanced intellisnap snapshot management  simpana onepass with exchange  tighter integration with microsoft hyper v  vmware vsphere and vcloud director  workflow automation  fourth generation parallel deduplication  and customizable web based reporting  dashboards and cloud based analytics 
our simpana architecture efficiently stores all protected data in a virtual repository  called contentstore  and opens access to simplify the way end users search  analyze and repurpose data across an enterprise 
our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software and are sold on a capacity basis  on a per copy basis or as site licenses 
during the fiscal year ended march   approximately of software license revenue was sold on a capacity basis 
capacity based software licenses provide our customers with unlimited licenses of specified software products based on a defined level of terabytes of data under management 
as a result  when we sell our platform through a capacity license  many of the various simpana functionalities are bundled into one capacity based price 
we anticipate that capacity based licenses will continue to account for the majority of our software license revenue for the foreseeable future 
the industry in which we currently operate continues to go through accelerating changes as the result of compounding data growth and the introduction of new technologies 
we are continuing to pursue an aggressive product development program in both data and information management solutions 
our data management solutions include not only traditional backup  but also new innovations in de duplication  data movement  virtualization  snap based backups and enterprise reporting 
our information management innovations are primarily in the areas of archiving  ediscovery  records management  governance and compliance 
we remain focused on both the data and information management trends in the marketplace and  in fact  a material portion of our existing research and development expenses are utilized toward the development of such new technologies discussed above 
while we are confident in our ability to meet these changing industry demands with our simpana suite and potential future releases  the development  release and timing of any features or functionality remain at our sole discretion and our solutions or other technologies may not be widely adopted 
the rapid growth of data  and the need to securely protect  manage and access this data is driving substantial opportunities for managed service providers msps to help organizations deploy and manage solutions that deliver data management capabilities 
the result is reduced long term management costs with increased offerings to customers  which we believe represents a long term industry trend in the way that services are offered 
given the nature of the industry in which we operate  our software applications are subject to obsolescence 
as noted above  we continually develop and introduce updates to our existing software applications in order to keep pace with evolving industry technologies 
in addition  we must address evolving industry standards  changing customer requirements and competitive software applications that may render our existing software applications obsolete 
for each of our software applications  we provide full support for the current generally available release and one prior release 
when we declare a product release obsolete  a customer notice is delivered twelve months prior to the effective date of obsolescence announcing continuation of full product support for the first six months 
we provide an additional six months of extended assistance support in which we only provide existing workarounds or fixes that do not require additional development activity 
we do not have existing plans to make any of our software products permanently obsolete 

table of contents sources of revenues we derive a significant portion of our total revenues from sales of licenses of our software applications 
we do not customize our software for a specific end user customer 
we sell our software applications to end user customers both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our global network of value added reseller partners  systems integrators  corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
our software revenue was of our total revenues for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal in recent fiscal years  we have generated approximately two thirds of our software revenue from our existing customer base and approximately one third of our software revenue from new customers 
in addition  our total software revenue in any particular period is  to a certain extent  dependent upon our ability to generate revenues from large customer software deals  which we refer to as enterprise software transactions 
we expect the number of enterprise software transactions transactions greater than million and resulting software revenue to increase throughout fiscal  although the size and timing of any particular software transaction is more difficult to forecast 
such software transactions represented approximately of our software revenue in fiscal  approximately of our software revenue in fiscal and approximately of our software revenue in fiscal software revenue generated through indirect distribution channels was of total software revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal software revenue generated through direct distribution channels was of total software revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the dollar value of software revenue generated through indirect distribution channels increased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the dollar value of software revenue generated through direct distribution decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in the dollar value of software revenue growth generated through our indirect distribution channels compared to our direct sales force in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in software revenue from our international operations  which is almost exclusively transacted through indirect distribution 
the decrease in the dollar value of the software revenue generated through our direct sales channel is due to a lower value of direct enterprise transactions in the united states 
deals initiated by our direct sales force are sometimes transacted through indirect channels based on end user customer requirements  which are not always in our control and can cause this overall percentage split to vary from fiscal year to fiscal year 
as such  there may be fluctuations in the dollars and percentage of software revenue generated through our direct distribution channels from time to time 
we believe that the growth of our software revenue  derived from both our indirect channel partners and direct sales force  are key attributes to our long term growth strategy 
we will continue to invest in both our channel relationships and direct sales force in the future  but we continue to expect more revenue to be generated through indirect distribution channels over the long term 
the failure of our indirect distribution channels or our direct sales force to effectively sell our software applications could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
we have a worldwide reseller and an original equipment agreement with dell 
our reseller agreement with dell provides them the right to market  resell and distribute certain of our products to their customers 
our original equipment manufacturer agreement with dell is discussed more fully below 
sales through our agreements with dell accounted for of our total revenues for fiscal  of our total revenues for fiscal and of our total revenues in fiscal in recent fiscal quarters  we have begun to shift most of our small and medium business segment transactions to non dell distribution partners as dell is now focused on this segment of the market with their own intellectual property 
as a result  the majority of the revenue that is still transacted through dell comes from add on purchases from our existing install base and from new enterprise software transactions where our sales force is directly involved 
we have also recently begun to take proactive steps to broaden our distribution related to enterprise software transactions 
over time  we believe it is likely that these actions will result in a decline in the percentage of our total revenues transacted through dell 
due to the timing of enterprise software transactions that are currently in our sales and marketing pipeline  there will likely be some fluctuations in the amount of revenue transacted through dell from quarter to quarter 

table of contents in may  we entered into a global oem agreement with netapp under which netapp will integrate elements of our simpana software suite with netapp snapshot and replication technology  under the netapp snapprotect brand 
during the fiscal years ended march  and march   we did not recognize a material amount of revenue under our oem agreement with netapp 
overall  we have original equipment manufacturer agreements primarily with dell  hitachi data systems and netapp for them to market  sell and support our software applications and services on a stand alone basis and or incorporate our software applications into their own hardware products 
dell  hitachi data systems and netapp have no obligation to recommend or offer our software applications exclusively or at all  and they have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time 
a material portion of our software revenue is sometimes generated through our original equipment manufacturer agreements 
sales through our original equipment manufacturer agreements accounted for of our total revenues for fiscal  of our total revenues for fiscal and of our total revenues for fiscal we also have non exclusive distribution agreements covering our north american commercial markets and our us federal government market with arrow enterprise computing solutions  inc arrow  a subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc  and avnet technology solutions avnet  a subsidiary of avnet  inc pursuant to these distribution agreements  these distributors primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our reseller partners and leveraging their own industry experience 
we generated approximately of our total revenues through arrow in fiscal  approximately of our total revenues in fiscal and approximately of our total revenues in fiscal avnet s total revenue contribution was not material in fiscal  or if arrow or avnet were to discontinue or reduce the sales of our products or if our agreement with arrow or avnet was terminated  and if we were unable to take back the management of our reseller channel or find another north american distributor to replace arrow or avnet  then it could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues 
we also derive a significant portion of our total revenues from services revenue 
our services revenue is made up of fees from the delivery of customer support and other professional services  which are typically sold in connection with the sale of our software applications 
customer support agreements provide technical support and unspecified software updates on a when and if available basis for an annual fee based on licenses purchased and the level of service subscribed 
other professional services include consulting  assessment and design services  implementation and post deployment services and training  all of which to date have predominantly been sold in connection with the sale of software applications 
our services revenue was of our total revenues for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the gross margin of our services revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the gross margin of our services revenue in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to higher costs of services associated with the expansion of our worldwide customer support operations 
overall  our services revenue has lower gross margins than our software revenue 
the gross margin of our software revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by services revenue may adversely affect our overall gross margins 
description of costs and expenses our cost of revenues is as follows cost of software revenue  consists primarily of third party royalties and other costs such as media  manuals  translation and distribution costs  and cost of services revenue  consists primarily of salary and employee benefit costs in providing customer support and other professional services 

table of contents our operating expenses are as follows sales and marketing  consists primarily of salaries  commissions  employee benefits  stock based compensation and other direct and indirect business expenses  including travel and related expenses  sales promotion expenses  public relations expenses and costs for marketing materials and other marketing events such as trade shows and advertising  research and development  which is primarily the expense of developing new software applications and modifying existing software applications  consists principally of salaries  stock based compensation and benefits for research and development personnel and related expenses  contract labor expense and consulting fees as well as other expenses associated with the design  certification and testing of our software applications  and legal costs associated with the patent registration of such software applications  general and administrative  consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation and benefits for our executive  accounting  human resources  legal  information systems and other administrative personnel 
also included in this category are other general corporate expenses  such as outside legal and accounting services  compliance costs and insurance  and depreciation and amortization  consists of depreciation expense primarily for computer equipment we use for information services and in our development and test labs 
we anticipate that each of the above categories of operating expenses will increase in dollar amounts  but will decline as a percentage of total revenues in the long term 
foreign currency exchange rates impact on results of operations sales outside the united states were approximately of our total revenue for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the income statements of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions generally results in increased revenue  operating expenses and income from operations for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue  operating expenses and net income will generally decrease for our non us operations if the non us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from the corresponding fiscal period  our total revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses from non us operations for fiscal would have been higher by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from the corresponding fiscal period  our total revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses from non us operations for fiscal would have been lower by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from cash balances  accounts receivables and intercompany accounts denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to the resulting transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses 
we recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies in presenting our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported therein 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they 
table of contents pertain to future events 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
the following is a description of our accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments  which could potentially have a material effect on our reported financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is based on complex rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently generally software revenue and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods generally services revenue 
we analyze various factors including  but not limited to  the sales of undelivered services when sold on a stand alone basis  our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers and resellers  accounts receivable aging data and contractual terms and conditions in helping us to make such judgments about revenue recognition 
changes in judgment on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
currently  we derive revenues from two primary sources software licenses and services 
services include customer support  consulting  assessment and design services  installation services and training 
a typical sales arrangement includes both of these sources 
for sales arrangements involving multiple elements  we recognize revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on fair value and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as revenue 
the determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements is based on the price charged when such elements are sold separately  which is commonly referred to as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software and are sold on a per copy basis  on a capacity basis or as site licenses 
software licenses sold on a capacity basis provide the customer with unlimited licenses of specified software products based on a defined level of terabytes of data under management 
site licenses give the customer the additional right to deploy the software on a limited basis during a specified term 
we recognize software revenue through direct sales channels upon receipt of a purchase order or other persuasive evidence and when the other three basic revenue recognition criteria are met as described in the revenue recognition section in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognize software revenue through all indirect sales channels on a sell through model 
a sell through model requires that we recognize revenue when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met and these channels complete the sale of our software products to the end user 
revenue from software licenses sold through an original equipment manufacturer partner is recognized upon the receipt of a royalty report or purchase order from that original equipment manufacturer partner 
services revenue includes revenue from customer support and other professional services 
customer support includes software updates on a when and if available basis  telephone support  integrated web based support and bug fixes or patches 
customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement  which is typically one year 
to determine the price for the customer support element when sold separately  we primarily use historical renewal rates 
historical renewal rates are supported by a rolling month vsoe analysis in which we segregate our customer support renewal contracts into different classes based on specific criteria including  but not limited to  dollar amount of software purchased  level of customer support being provided and distribution channel 
the purpose of such an analysis is to determine if the customer support element that is deferred at the time of a software sale is consistent with how it is sold on a stand alone renewal basis 

table of contents our other professional services include consulting  implementation and post deployment services  and education services 
other professional services provided by us are not mandatory and can also be performed by the customer or a third party 
in addition to a signed purchase order  our consulting  assessment and design services and installation services are  in some cases  evidenced by a statement of work  which defines the specific scope of the services to be performed when sold and performed on a stand alone basis or included in multiple element sales arrangements 
revenues from consulting  assessment and design services and installation services are based upon a daily  weekly or monthly rate and are recognized when the services are completed 
training includes courses taught by our instructors or third party contractors either at one of our facilities or at the customer s site 
training fees are recognized as revenue after the training course has been provided 
based on our analysis of such other professional services transactions sold on a stand alone basis  we have concluded we have established vsoe for such other professional services when sold in connection with a multiple element sales arrangement 
in summary  we have analyzed all of the undelivered elements included in our multiple element sales arrangements and determined that we have vsoe of fair value to allocate revenues to services 
our analysis of the undelivered elements has provided us with results that are consistent with the estimates and assumptions used to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our multiple element sales arrangements 
accordingly  assuming all basic revenue recognition criteria are met  software revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software license using the residual method 
we are not likely to materially change our pricing and discounting practices in the future 
our sales arrangements generally do not include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement does include an acceptance clause  we defer the revenue for such an arrangement and recognize it upon acceptance 
acceptance occurs upon the earliest of receipt of a written customer acceptance  waiver of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
stock based compensation as of march   we maintain two stock incentive plans  which are described more fully in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we account for our stock incentive plans based on the grant date fair value recognition provisions in accordance with asc we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes formula 
the fair value of restricted stock units awarded is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation for all share based payment awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
forfeitures are estimated based on a historical analysis of our actual stock award forfeitures 
we anticipate that future grants under our stock incentive plans will include both non qualified stock options and restricted stock units 
the average expected life for fiscal was determined according to the simplified method  which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
during fiscal  we began incorporating our historical data into the expected term calculation for stock options granted 
we are now able to demonstrate significant stock option exercise activity for options granted subsequent to our initial public offering to provide a reasonable basis for incorporating historical data into our expected term of future stock option grants 
as a result  for twelve months ended march   our calculation of expected term includes a combination of actual exercise data and an assumption on when the remaining outstanding options with similar characteristics will be exercised based on our historical data 
in determining expected life  we separate employees into groups that have historically exhibited similar behavior with regard to option exercises 
expected volatility through september  was calculated based on a blended approach that included the historical volatility of a peer group  the implied volatility of the our traded options with a remaining maturity greater than six months and the historical realized volatility of our common stock 
effective october   we excluded the historical volatility of a peer group in our expected volatility calculation due to the fact that our 
table of contents common stock has been publicly traded for a period that approximates our weighted average expected term 
as a result  expected volatility subsequent to october  was calculated based on a blended approach that included the implied volatility of our traded options with a remaining maturity greater than six months and the historical realized volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined by reference to us treasury yield curve rates with a remaining term that is approximately the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures are estimated based on our historical analysis of actual stock option forfeitures 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model in the fiscal years ended march  and are as follows year ended march  dividend yield none none expected volatility weighted average expected volatility risk free interest rates weighted average expected life in years the weighted average fair value of stock options granted was per option during the year ended march  and per option during the year ended march  in addition  the weighted average fair value of restricted stock units awarded was per share during the year ended march  and per share during the year ended march  as of march   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  related to non vested stock option and restricted stock unit awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the intrinsic value of the options outstanding as of march  was million  of which million related to vested options and million related to unvested options 
we anticipate that future grants under our stock incentive plans will include both non qualified stock options and restricted stock units 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of march   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million  which were primarily related to federal and state research tax credit carryforwards  stock based compensation and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
as of march   we maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets totaling million 
substantially all of the valuation allowance we have recorded at march  is against new jersey state research tax credits due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize such state research tax credits before they expire 
we based our valuation allowance on our estimates of taxable income by legal entity and the period over which our state research tax credits will be recoverable 

table of contents at march   we have state net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and also have nol carryforwards for foreign tax purposes of approximately million 
at march   we have federal and state research tax credit r d carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credit carryforwards expire from through  and the state research tax credit carryforwards expire from through at march   we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million 
as of march   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  all of which  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective tax rate 
in addition  we have accrued interest and penalties of million related to the unrecognized tax benefits 
interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense 
components of the reserve are classified as either current or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
accordingly  our unrecognized tax benefits of million and the related accrued interest and penalties of million are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately million of our currently remaining unrecognized tax benefits and approximately less than million of related accrued interest and penalties may be realized by the end of fiscal as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations 
we conduct business globally and as a result  file income tax returns in the united states and in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world  including such major jurisdictions as the united states  australia  canada  germany  netherlands and united kingdom 
our us federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended march  is currently under audit by the us internal revenue service 
in addition  our german subsidiary s income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march  through march  are currently under audit by the german tax authorities 
the following table summarizes the tax years in the major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities as of march  the years subject to income tax examination in our foreign jurisdictions cover the maximum time period with respect to these jurisdictions 
due to nol carryforwards  in some cases the tax years continue to remain subject to examination with respect to such nols 
tax jurisdiction years subject to income tax examination us federal present new jersey present foreign jurisdictions present software development costs research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred

liquidity and capital resources as of march   our cash and cash equivalents balance of million primarily consisted of money market funds 
in addition  we have approximately million of short term investments invested in certificates of deposit at march  in recent fiscal years  our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations 
as of march   the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states by our foreign legal entities was approximately million 
these balances are dispersed across many international locations around the world 
we believe that such dispersion meets the current and anticipated future liquidity needs of our foreign legal entities 
in addition  it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign legal entities 
in the event we needed to repatriate funds from outside of the united states  such 
table of contents repatriation would likely be subject to restrictions by local laws and or tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes 
it is not currently practical to estimate the legal restrictions or tax liability that would arise from such repatriations 
as of march  we are authorized to repurchase up to a total of million of our common stock through march  under our stock repurchase program 
under our stock repurchase program  repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to unissued status 
our stock repurchase program has been funded by our existing cash and cash equivalent balances as well as cash flows provided by our operations 
there were no repurchases of our common stock during fiscal as of march   we have repurchased approximately million  or million shares  under our stock repurchase plan at an average purchase price of per share 
as a result  we may repurchase an additional million of our common stock through march  the primary business reason for our stock repurchase program is to reduce the dilutive impact on our common shares outstanding associated with stock option exercises and our previous public and private stock offerings 
under our stock repurchase program  we have bought back approximately of the common stock that was outstanding at the time the stock repurchase program was announced 
in addition  at the time we implemented our stock repurchase program in late fiscal we believed that our share price was undervalued and the best use for a portion of our cash balance was to repurchase some of our outstanding common stock 
our future stock repurchase activity is subject to the business judgment of our management and board of directors  taking into consideration our historical and projected results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and other anticipated capital requirements or investment alternatives 
on january   we closed on a purchase of land located in tinton falls  new jersey for our future corporate campus headquarters to support the long term growth of our business 
we are in the process of completing the design and construction of the headquarters  which we expect to finalize over approximately the next years 
our estimate of the build out  including the land purchase  building and campus infrastructure  is approximately million to million 
we expect to fund this capital expenditure from our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and our cash generated from operations 
our summarized annual cash flow information is as follows in thousands year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effects of exchange rate changes in cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  cash generated by operating activities was primarily due to net income adjusted for the impact of non cash charges  an increase in deferred services revenue as a result of customer support agreements from new customers and renewal agreements with our installed software base  and an increase in accrued liabilities 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues and timing of cash receipts 
in fiscal and fiscal  cash generated by operating activities was primarily due to net income adjusted for the impact of non cash charges  an increase in deferred services revenue as a result of customer support agreements from new customers and renewal agreements with our installed software base  and an increase in accrued liabilities 

table of contents net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and less than million in fiscal in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was due to the purchase of property and equipment in the amounts of million for purchases relating to our new corporate campus headquarters and million of capital expenditures as we continue to invest in and enhance our global infrastructure 
these increases were partially offset by net proceeds from the maturity of short term investments of million

working capital increased million from million as of march  to million as of march  the increase in working capital is primarily due to a million increase in cash and short term investments and a million increase in accounts receivable 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenue and a million increase in accrued liabilities 
the increase in cash and short term investments is primarily due to net income generated during the period  cash received from the collection of account receivables and cash received from the exercise of stock options 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to higher deferred services revenue from customer support agreements from software sales to new customers and renewal agreements with our installed software base 
the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to higher employee and related compensation accruals 
working capital increased million from million as of march  to million as of march  the increase in working capital is primarily due to an million increase in cash and short term investments 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenue  a million increase in accrued liabilities and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in cash and short term investments is primarily due to net income generated during the period  cash received from the collection of account receivables and cash received from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock during fiscal the increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to higher deferred services revenue from customer support agreements from software sales to new customers and renewal agreements with our installed software base 
the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to higher 
table of contents employee and related compensation accruals and the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to strong collections efforts and timing of cash receipts 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and our cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures including our planned new corporate campus headquarters and potential stock repurchases for at least the next months 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements during this period 
adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to existing stockholders will result 
if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties  the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility  and would also require us to fund additional interest expense 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments our material capital commitments consist of obligations under facilities and operating leases 
some of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions 
we recognize rent expense under leases on a straight line basis 
we anticipate that we will experience an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments as a result of our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure  personnel and resources devoted to building our brand name 
the following table summarizes our obligations as of march  dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we generally do not enter into binding purchase obligations 
the purchase obligations above relate primarily to marketing and software development services  it infrastructure costs and costs associated with the design and construction of our corporate campus headquarters 
the contractual obligations table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits recorded in other liabilities totaling million because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
the million is classified as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of march  as none of these obligations are anticipated to be paid within one year from april  as of march   we have an outstanding letter of credit for million issued in connection with a revenue transaction 
this letter of credit will remain outstanding until september  we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a fixed cost per unit shipped or a fixed fee for unlimited units shipped over a designated period 
royalty expense  included in cost of software revenues  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we offer a day limited product warranty for our software 
to date  costs relating to this product warranty have not been material 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of march  and  other than our operating leases  we do not have off balance sheet financing arrangements  including any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
indemnifications certain of our software licensing agreements contain certain provisions that indemnify our customers from any claim  suit or proceeding arising from alleged or actual intellectual property infringement 
these provisions continue in perpetuity along with our software licensing agreements 
we have never incurred a liability relating to one of these indemnification provisions in the past and we believe that the likelihood of any future payout relating to these provisions is remote 
therefore  we have not recorded a liability during any period related to these indemnification provisions 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu  which requires companies to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial statements or footnotes 
asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  the new requirements will take effect for us in the first quarter of fiscal and will be applied prospectively 
we do not believe the adoption of asu will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
asu became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal and was applied retrospectively 
there was no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact our accounting and disclosures in future periods 
since these rules have not yet been issued  the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of march   our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances consisted primarily of money market funds and certificates of deposit 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we are not subject to any material interest rate risk on these balances 
foreign currency risk economic exposure as a global company  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies and this revenue could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
approximately of our sales were outside the united states in fiscal and were outside the united states in fiscal our primary exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the 
table of contents us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  indian rupee  korean won and singapore dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive in foreign markets  which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
historically  we have periodically reviewed and revised the pricing of our products available to our customers in foreign countries and we have not maintained excess cash balances in foreign accounts 
we estimate that a change in all foreign exchange rates would impact our reported operating profit by approximately million annually 
this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 
transaction exposure our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is primarily the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary 
our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and we generally do not maintain excess us dollar cash balances in foreign accounts 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
we recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the net foreign currency transaction losses recorded in general and administrative expenses include settlement gains and losses on forward contracts disclosed below 
to date  we have selectively hedged our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses on the balance sheet through the use of forward contracts  which were not designated as hedging instruments 
the duration of forward contracts utilized for hedging our balance sheet exposure is generally one to three months 
as of march  and march   we did not have any forward contracts outstanding 
we recorded net realized losses in general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal and net realized gains in general and administrative expenses of less than million in fiscal in the future  we may enter into additional foreign currency based hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates on the balance sheet
