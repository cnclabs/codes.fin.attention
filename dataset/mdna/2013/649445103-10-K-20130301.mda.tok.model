table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this discussion and analysis  the words we  us  our  and the company are used to refer to new york community bancorp  inc and our consolidated subsidiaries  including new york community bank the community bank and new york commercial bank the commercial bank collectively  the banks 
executive summary in  the us economy showed certain signs of improvement  as the unemployment rate declined from in december to in december although unemployment rates declined year over year in florida  arizona  and ohio three of the five states served by our branch network unemployment rates rose slightly in new york and new jersey  the other two 
in new york city  where most of our branches and most of the properties and businesses securing our held for investment loans are located  unemployment was in december and the changes in certain other local economic indices were mixed in their direction 
for example  personal bankruptcy filings throughout metro new york fell in the twelve months ended september  the most recent month at which such data was available at this writing  while the number of business bankruptcy filings was essentially unchanged 
in manhattan  which is home to of our multi family loans and of our commercial real estate credits  the office vacancy rate rose to in the fourth quarter of from in the year earlier three months 
through december  average home prices rose year over year throughout the nation  according to the s p case shiller home price indices 
while home prices fell in metro new york  home prices rose in greater cleveland  miami  and phoenix by   and  respectively 
meanwhile  the volume of new home sales rose nearly nationwide from the volume reported for  to an estimated  in  according to a us commerce department report 
in addition  the consumer confidence index was modestly higher in than it was in an index level of or more is considered indicative of a strong economy  the consumer confidence index was in december and in december also  in  the target federal funds rate was maintained by the federal open market committee the fomc at a range of zero to basis points the same range to which it was lowered in the fourth quarter of market interest rates  meanwhile  declined to record lows from the already low levels we saw in  encouraging homeowners throughout the us to refinance or purchase new homes 
the low level of market interest rates also prompted an increase in the refinancing of multi family loans in new york city  where most of our multi family loans are produced 
against this backdrop  we delivered a strong financial performance 
earnings rose to million  or per diluted share  in from the level recorded in  which was million  or per diluted share 
we attribute our year over year earnings growth to our two pronged approach to lending originating multi family loans for investment  primarily in new york city  and originating one to four family loans throughout the us  primarily for sale 
in  we originated billion of held for investment loans  including billion of loans secured by multi family buildings  the latter amount exceeding the year earlier volume by million 
while our net interest income and margin declined  as our balance sheet was replenished with lower yielding assets  the impact was substantially offset by an increase in income from prepayment penalties  as refinancing activity in our multi family lending niche surged 
in  prepayment penalty income contributed million to our net interest income and basis points to our net interest margin  exceeding the year earlier measures by million and eight basis points  respectively 
net interest income declined million  or  year over year  to billion  while our margin declined basis points to 
notwithstanding the volume of loans that prepaid during the year including two loans to a single borrower totaling million  our portfolio of held for investment loans rose billion  or  from the balance recorded at december  to billion at december  
table of contents the decline in net interest income was more than offset by an increase in mortgage banking income  as the decline in residential mortgage rates also prompted a surge in the production of one to four family loans for sale 
as more consumers refinanced or purchased new homes  the volume of one to four family loans produced for sale rose billion  or  to billion 
during this time  the income produced by our mortgage banking business rose million  or  to million 
we also attribute the strength of our performance to the quality of our assets  which reflected substantial improvement over the course of the year 
for example  net charge offs declined million year over year  to million  and the ratio of net charge offs to average loans improved to from 
in addition  non performing non covered assets totaled million at the end of december  reflecting a year over year reduction of million  or 
the balance at december  represented of total non covered assets  an improvement from at the year earlier date 
while the improvements in asset quality were partly due to the improvement in economic and market conditions  they also reflect our ability to successfully restructure troubled assets and to dispose of certain other real estate owned oreo without incurring a material loss 
in addition  while several of the communities we serve in new jersey and metro new york were hurt by hurricane sandy  the impact on the properties and businesses securing our loans  and the effect on our branches  was  thankfully  negligible 
two additional features of our performance were the growth of our deposits and the strategic reduction of our funding costs 
for example  in connection with our assumption of billion in deposits from aurora bank fsb aurora bank at the end of the second quarter  we received a payment of million which was utilized to reduce the cost of the acquired funds 
the deposits we assumed were used  in part  to reduce our balance of fhlb ny advances and  with it  the average cost of such funds 
another important step we took in was redeeming million of trust preferred securities at the end of december  and beginning the process of repositioning certain of our wholesale borrowings 
in addition to the billion of wholesale borrowings that were repositioned in late december  another billion of such funds were repositioned in january all told  we reduced the weighted average cost of these borrowed funds by basis points  and extended the weighted average call and maturity dates by approximately four years 
consistent with our interest in returning value to our investors  we distributed total cash dividends of million over the course of  in the form of four quarterly dividends of per share  or annualized 
stockholders equity nonetheless rose million year over year to billion  and tangible stockholders equity rose million to billion at december  please see the reconciliations of our gaap and non gaap capital measures that appear on the last page of this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s regulatory capital ratios each exceeded the minimum levels required  and each of our bank subsidiaries exceeded the regulatory requirements for classification as well capitalized banks 
recent events on january   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  and the judgments  estimates  and assumptions used therein  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies the determination of the allowances for loan losses  the valuation of loans held for sale  the determination of whether an impairment of securities is other than temporary  the determination of the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment  and the determination of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment  which may result in changes to future financial results 
in addition  the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in our judgments  estimates  and assumptions 

table of contents allowances for loan losses allowance for losses on non covered loans the allowance for losses on non covered loans is increased by provisions for non covered loan losses that are charged against earnings  and is reduced by net charge offs and or reversals  if any  that are credited to earnings 
although non covered loans are held by either the community bank or the commercial bank  and a separate loan loss allowance is established for each  the total of the two allowances is available to cover all losses incurred 
in addition  except as otherwise noted below  the process for establishing the allowance for losses on non covered loans is the same for each of the community bank and the commercial bank 
in determining the respective allowances for loan losses  management considers the community bank s and the commercial bank s current business strategies and credit processes  including compliance with guidelines approved by the respective boards of directors with regard to credit limitations  loan approvals  underwriting criteria  and loan workout procedures 
the allowance for losses on non covered loans is established based on our evaluation of the probable inherent losses in our portfolio in accordance with gaap  and are comprised of both specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances 
specific valuation allowances are established based on management s analyses of individual loans that are considered impaired 
if a non covered loan is deemed to be impaired  management measures the extent of the impairment and establishes a specific valuation allowance for that amount 
a non covered loan is classified as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we apply this classification as necessary to non covered loans individually evaluated for impairment in our portfolios of multi family  commercial real estate  acquisition  development  and construction  and commercial and industrial loans 
smaller balance homogenous loans and loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value are evaluated for impairment on a collective  rather than individual  basis 
we generally measure impairment on an individual loan and determine the extent to which a specific valuation allowance is necessary by comparing the loan s outstanding balance to either the fair value of the collateral  less the estimated cost to sell  or the present value of expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
a specific valuation allowance is established when the fair value of the collateral  net of the estimated costs to sell  or the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
we also follow a process to assign general valuation allowances to non covered loan categories 
general valuation allowances are established by applying our loan loss provisioning methodology  and reflect the inherent risk in outstanding held for investment loans 
this loan loss provisioning methodology considers various factors in determining the appropriate quantified risk factors to use to determine the general valuation allowances 
the factors assessed begin with the historical loan loss experience for each of the major loan categories we maintain 
our historical loan loss experience is then adjusted by considering qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience  including  but not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans  changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  the volume of non accrual loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans  changes in the quality of our loan review system  changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  and the effect of other external factors  such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio 
by considering the factors discussed above  we determine quantifiable risk factors that are applied to each non impaired loan or loan type in the loan portfolio to determine the general valuation allowances 

table of contents in recognition of prevailing macroeconomic and real estate market conditions  the time periods considered for historical loss experience continue to be the last three years and the current period 
we also evaluate the sufficiency of the overall allocations used for the allowance for losses on non covered loans by considering the loss experience in the current and prior calendar year 
the process of establishing the allowance for losses on non covered loans also involves periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified in house and external property appraisers inspectors  as applicable  regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent board committee  during which observable trends in the local economy and or the real estate market are discussed  assessment of the aforementioned factors by the pertinent members of the boards of directors and executive management when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes on the future level of loan losses  and analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate  as well as on an individual loan basis  taking into consideration payment history  underwriting analyses  and internal risk ratings 
in order to determine their overall adequacy  each of the respective loan loss allowances is reviewed quarterly by management and by the mortgage and real estate committee of the community bank s board of directors the mortgage committee or the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank the credit committee  as applicable 
we charge off loans  or portions of loans  in the period that such loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
the collectability of individual loans is determined through an assessment of the financial condition and repayment capacity of the borrower and or through an estimate of the fair value of any underlying collateral 
generally  the time period in which this assessment is made is within the same quarter that the loan is considered impaired and quarterly thereafter 
for non real estate related consumer credits  the following past due time periods determine when charge offs are typically recorded closed end credits are charged off in the quarter that the loan becomes days past due  open end credits are charged off in the quarter that the loan becomes days past due  and both closed end and open end credits are typically charged off in the quarter that the credit is days past the date we received notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy 
the level of future additions to the respective non covered loan loss allowances is based on many factors  including certain factors that are beyond management s control such as changes in economic and local market conditions  including declines in real estate values  and increases in vacancy rates and unemployment 
management uses the best available information to recognize losses on loans or to make additions to the loan loss allowances  however  the community bank and or the commercial bank may be required to take certain charge offs and or recognize further additions to their loan loss allowances  based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided to them during their examinations of the banks 
allowance for losses on covered loans we have elected to account for the loans acquired in the amtrust bank amtrust and desert hills bank desert hills acquisitions ie  our covered loans based on expected cash flows 
this election is in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality asc 
in accordance with asc  we will maintain the integrity of a pool of multiple loans accounted for as a single asset and with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows 
under our loss sharing agreements with the fdic  covered loans are reported exclusive of the fdic loss share receivable 
the covered loans acquired in the amtrust and desert hills acquisitions are  and will continue to be  reviewed for collectability based on the expectations of cash flows from these loans 
covered loans have been aggregated into pools of loans with common characteristics 
in determining the allowance for losses on covered loans  we periodically perform an analysis to estimate the expected cash flows for each of the loan pools 
we record a provision for losses on covered loans to the extent that the expected cash flows from a loan pool have decreased for credit related items since the acquisition date 
accordingly  if there is a decrease in expected cash flows due to an increase in estimated credit losses compared to the estimates made at the respective acquisition dates  the decrease in the present value of expected cash flows will be recorded as a provision for covered loan losses charged to earnings  and the allowance for covered loan losses will be increased 
a related credit to non interest income and an increase in the fdic loss share receivable will be recognized at the same time  and will be measured based on the loss sharing agreement percentages 

table of contents please see note  allowances for loan losses for a further discussion of our allowance for losses on covered loans as well as additional information about our allowances for losses on non covered loans 
loans held for sale we carry at fair value the one to four family mortgage loans we originate for sale to investors 
the fair value of such loans is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans 
changes in fair value  which are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income  are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with mortgage loans held for sale 
in addition  we use various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in the fair value of the underlying loans 
investment securities the securities portfolio primarily consists of mortgage related securities and  to a lesser extent  debt and equity together  other securities 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at their estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost  less the non credit portion of otti recorded in aocl 
the fair values of our securities and particularly our fixed rate securities are affected by changes in market interest rates and credit spreads 
in general  as interest rates rise and or credit spreads widen  the fair value of fixed rate securities will decline  as interest rates fall and or credit spreads tighten  the fair value of fixed rate securities will rise 
we regularly conduct a review and evaluation of our securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
if we deem any decline in value to be other than temporary  the security is written down to its current fair value  creating a new cost basis  and the resultant loss other than the otti on debt securities attributable to non credit factors is charged against earnings and recorded in non interest income 
our assessment of a decline in fair value includes judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity that issued the investment security  as well as a review of the security s underlying collateral 
broad changes in the overall market or interest rate environment generally will not lead to a write down 
in accordance with otti accounting guidance  unless we have the intent to sell  or it is more likely than not that we may be required to sell a security before recovery  otti is recognized as a realized loss on the income statement to the extent that the decline in fair value is credit related 
if there is a decline in fair value of a security below its carrying amount and we have the intent to sell it  or it is more likely than not that we may be required to sell the security before recovery  the entire amount of the decline in fair value is charged to earnings 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  at the reporting unit level  at least once a year 
in addition to being tested annually  goodwill would be tested if there were a triggering event 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
however  a company can  under accounting standards update asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this amendment  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determined  based on a qualitative assessment  that it was more likely than not that its fair value was less than its carrying amount 
the company did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment in the first step step is used to identify potential impairment  and involves comparing each reporting segment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting segment exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step step is performed to measure the amount 
step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting segment for which impairment was indicated in step the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  ie  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting segment  as determined in step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangibles  as if the reporting segment were being acquired in a business combination at the impairment test date 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting segment  there is no impairment 
if the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting segment exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss 
table of contents cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting segment  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in the identification of reporting units and in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  management has determined that the company has two reporting segments banking operations and residential mortgage banking 
all of our recorded goodwill has resulted from prior acquisitions and  accordingly  is attributed to banking operations 
there is no goodwill associated with residential mortgage banking  as this segment was acquired in our fdic assisted amtrust acquisition  which resulted in a bargain purchase gain 
in order to perform our annual goodwill impairment test  we determined the carrying value of the banking operations segment to be the carrying value of the company and compared it to the fair value of the banking operations segment as the fair value of the company 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and found no indication of goodwill impairment at that date 
income taxes in estimating income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
in this process  management also relies on tax opinions  recent audits  and historical experience 
although we use the best available information to record income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws and judicial guidance influencing our overall or transaction specific tax position 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and the carryforward of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable  based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the prudence and feasibility of tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances recorded in a business combination would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill

loans notwithstanding the prepayment of our largest loan relationship in the amount of million  total loans rose billion  or  year over year to billion  representing of total assets at december  covered loans represented billion  or  of the year end balance  while non covered loans accounted for the remaining billion  or 
included in non covered loans were billion of loans held for investment  representing of the total loan balance  and billion of loans held for sale 
covered loans covered loans refers to the loans we acquired in our fdic assisted amtrust bank amtrust and desert hills bank desert hills acquisitions  and are referred to as such because they are covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
at december   covered loans represented billion  or  of the total loan balance  a million reduction from the year earlier amount 
one to four family loans represented billion of total covered loans at the end of this december  with all other types of covered loans representing million  combined 
covered one to four family loans include both fixed and adjustable rate loans 
covered other loans consist of commercial real estate cre loans  acquisition  development  and construction adc loans  multi family loans  commercial and industrial c i loans  home equity lines of credit helocs  and consumer loans 
at december   billion  or  of the loans in our covered loan portfolio were variable rate loans  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the remainder of the covered loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate loans 
at december   the interest rates on of our covered variable rate loans were scheduled to reprice within twelve months and annually thereafter 
we expect such loans to reprice at lower interest rates 
the interest rates on the variable rate loans in the covered loan portfolio are indexed to either the one year libor or the one year treasury rate  plus a spread in the range of to  subject to certain caps 
the amtrust and desert hills loss sharing agreements each require the fdic to reimburse us for of losses up to a specified threshold  and for of losses beyond that threshold  with respect to covered loans and covered other real estate owned oreo 
in  we recorded a provision for losses on covered loans of million  as compared to million in the prior year 
the reduction was largely attributable to a million recovery in the fourth quarter  reflecting an increase in expected cash flows from certain pools of acquired loans 
the respective provisions were largely offset by fdic indemnification income of million and million  recorded in non interest income in the corresponding years

in addition to multi family loans and cre loans  the held for investment portfolio includes substantially smaller balances of adc loans  one to four family loans  and other loans  with c i loans comprising the bulk of the other loan portfolio 
the vast majority of our non covered loans held for investment consist of loans that we ourselves originated or  in some cases  acquired in our business combinations prior to originations of held for investment loans totaled billion in  comparable to the volume produced in the prior year 
while portfolio growth was limited by an increase in repayments  we benefited from the related rise in prepayment penalty income  as further discussed under net interest income later in this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents multi family loans multi family loans are our principal asset  and non luxury residential apartment buildings with below market rents in new york city constitute our primary lending niche 
consistent with our emphasis on multi family lending  multi family loan originations represented billion  or  of the loans we produced in for investment  modestly exceeding the year earlier amount 
although most of the loans we produced in were the result of borrowers refinancing  an increase in property sales and other transactions also played a part 
this was especially true late in the fourth quarter  as many of our borrowers anticipated changes being made to the us tax code that could have an adverse impact on their investments in real estate 
at december   the balance of multi family loans represented billion  or  of total non covered loans held for investment  reflecting a year over year increase of billion  despite the prepayment of our then largest loan relationship in the fourth quarter of the year 
the average multi family loan had a principal balance of million at the end of this december  comparable to the average principal balance at december  the vast majority of our multi family loans are made to long term owners of buildings with apartments that are subject to rent regulation  and therefore feature below market rents 
our borrowers typically use the funds we provide to make improvements to certain apartments  as a result of which they are able to increase the rents their tenants pay 
in doing so  the borrower creates more cash flows to borrow against in future years 
we also make loans to building owners seeking to expand their real estate holdings with the purchase of additional properties 
in addition to underwriting multi family loans on the basis of the buildings income and condition  we consider the borrowers credit history  profitability  and building management expertise 
borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings current rent rolls  their financial statements  and related documents 
our multi family loans typically feature a term of ten or twelve years  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan  and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve 
the rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediate term interest rates plus a spread 
during the remaining years  the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest  as reported in the new york times  plus a spread 
alternately  the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the five year fixed advance rate of the federal home loan bank fhlb of new york the fhlb ny  plus a spread 
the fixed rate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then outstanding loan balance 
in either case  the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five or seven year term 
as the rent roll increases  the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage  and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six or eight 
notably  the expected weighted average life of the multi family loan portfolio was years at december   as compared to years at december   an indication of the increase in refinancing activity and property transactions over the course of the year 
multi family loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule 
depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment  the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then current loan balance 
if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option  the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve 
for example  a ten year multi family loan that prepays in year three would generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance 
a twelve year multi family loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points 
prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income and are therefore reflected in the average yields on our loans and assets  our interest rate spread and net interest margin  and the level of net interest income we record 
no assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment penalty income  as such income is only recorded when cash is received 
our success as a multi family lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the market s leading mortgage brokers  who are familiar with our lending practices  our underwriting standards  and our long standing practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties 
because the multi family market is largely broker driven  the process of producing such loans is expedited  with loans generally taking four to six weeks to process  and the related expenses being substantially reduced 

table of contents at december   the vast majority of our multi family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings 
in addition  of our multi family loans were secured by buildings in new york city  with manhattan accounting for the largest share 
of the loans secured by buildings outside new york city  the state of new york was home to  with new jersey and pennsylvania accounting for and  respectively 
the remaining of multi family loans were secured by buildings outside these markets  including the three other states served by our retail branch offices 
our emphasis on multi family loans is driven by several factors  including their structure  which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree 
another factor driving our focus on multi family lending has been the comparative quality of the loans we produce 
reflecting the nature of the buildings securing our loans  our underwriting standards  and the generally conservative ltv ratios our multi family loans feature at origination  a relatively small percentage of the multi family loans that have transitioned to non performing status have actually resulted in losses during the most recent downturn in the credit cycle  as well as historically 
we primarily underwrite our multi family loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property  with a reliance on the income approach to appraising the properties  rather than the sales approach 
the sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market  as well as general economic conditions  and is therefore likely to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn 
we also consider a variety of other factors  including the physical condition of the underlying property  the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio  which is the ratio of the property s net operating income to its debt service  and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property 
the multi family loans we are originating today generally represent no more than of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property  and typically feature an amortization period of up to years 
in addition to requiring a minimum debt service coverage ratio of on multi family buildings  we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises  and an assignment of rents and leases 
accordingly  while our multi family lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle  we continue to believe that the multi family loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans 
in general  buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable  with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time 
because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition  we believe that they are reasonably likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times 
in addition  we underwrite our multi family loans on the basis of the current cash flows generated by the underlying properties  and exclude any partial property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive 
commercial real estate loans in  cre loans represented billion  or  of loans originated for investment  a million increase from the year earlier amount 
although the growth of the portfolio was somewhat tempered by the level of repayments  the balance of cre loans rose million  or  year over year to billion at the end of this past december  representing of the total held for investment portfolio at that date 
at december   the average cre loan had a principal balance of million  as compared to million at the prior year end 
the increase in cre loan production was primarily due to the low level of market interest rates  continued improvement in local market conditions  and the origination of certain larger cre loans 
the cre loans we produce are secured by income producing properties such as office buildings  retail centers  mixed use buildings  and multi tenanted light industrial properties 
at december   of our cre loans were secured by properties in new york city  primarily in manhattan  while properties on long island and in new jersey accounted for and  respectively 
another of cre properties were located in pennsylvania  while properties outside new york  new jersey  and pennsylvania accounted for 
the pricing of our cre loans is similar to the pricing of our multi family credits  ie  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan that is generally based on intermediate term interest rates plus a spread 
during years six through ten or eight through twelve  the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest  as reported in the new york times  plus a spread 
alternately  the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the five year fixed advance rate of the fhlb ny plus a spread 
the fixed rate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the then outstanding loan balance 
in either case  the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five year term 

table of contents prepayment penalties also apply to cre loans  as they do to our multi family credits 
depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment  the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the then current loan balance 
if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option  the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve 
our cre loans tend to refinance within three to four years of origination  in fact  the expected weighted average life of the cre portfolio was years at both december  and the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties 
to minimize our credit risk  we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards  and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property s current income stream and debt service coverage ratio 
the approval of a loan also depends on the borrower s credit history  profitability  and expertise in property management  and generally requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio of and a maximum ltv ratio of 
in addition  the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures  equipment  and other personal property of the borrower and or an assignment of the rents and or leases 
acquisition  development  and construction loans in the interest of reducing our exposure to credit risk  we have limited our production of adc loans to loans that have limited market risk and low ltv ratios  and that are made to reputable borrowers with significant development experience 
in  adc loans represented million  or  of the loans we produced for investment  and the portfolio of such loans declined million year over year  to million  representing of total loans held for investment  at december  at december   of the loans in our adc portfolio were for land acquisition and development  the remaining consisted of loans that were provided for the construction of owner occupied homes and commercial properties 
such loans are typically originated for terms of to months  and feature a floating rate of interest tied to prime  with a floor 
they also generate origination fees that are recorded as interest income and amortized over the lives of the loans 
in addition  of the loans in the adc portfolio were for properties in new york city  with manhattan accounting for more than half of new york city s share 
long island accounted for of our adc loans  with new jersey accounting for 
reflecting the limited extent to which adc loans have been originated beyond our immediate market  of our adc loans are secured by properties beyond new jersey and new york 
because adc loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk  especially during a downturn in the credit cycle  borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion 
in the twelve months ended december   we recovered losses against guarantees of million  in contrast to  in the prior year 
the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the property s value upon completion of construction  the estimated cost of construction  including interest  and the estimated time to complete and or sell or lease such property 
if the appraised value proves to be inaccurate  the cost of completion is greater than expected  or the length of time to complete and or sell or lease the collateral property is greater than anticipated  the property could have a value upon completion that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the loan 
reflecting the disposition of certain non performing assets  of the loans in our adc loan portfolio were non performing at the end of this december  as compared to at december  when applicable  as a condition to closing an adc loan  it is our practice to require that residential properties be pre sold or that borrowers secure permanent financing commitments from a recognized lender for an amount equal to  or greater than  the amount of our loan 
in some cases  we ourselves may provide permanent financing 
we typically require pre leasing for adc loans on commercial properties 
one to four family loans to meet the needs of our customers  we originate agency conforming one to four family loans through our mortgage banking business in cleveland or  in some states  directly through the community bank 
the vast majority of the one to four family loans we produce are aggregated for sale with others produced by our mortgage banking clients throughout the country 
these loans are generally sold  servicing retained  to government sponsored enterprises gses 
for more detailed information about our production of one to four family loans for sale  please see non covered loans held for sale later in this section 

table of contents until last year  the vast majority of the one to four family loans we held for investment were loans that we acquired in our merger transactions prior to however  in  we began to originate hybrid jumbo one to four family loans for our own portfolio 
as a result  the balance of one to four family loans held for investment rose million year over year to million  representing of total held for investment loans at december st 
other loans largely reflecting our focus on the production of multi family and cre loans  we originated other loans for investment of million in  representing a million decrease from the year earlier amount 
c i loans represented million of the total  and were down million year over year 
as a result  the portfolio of other loans declined million from the balance at year end  to million  representing of total loans held for investment at december  included in the latter balance were c i loans of million  reflecting a million reduction from the year earlier amount 
the vast majority of our c i loans are made to small and mid size businesses in new york city and long island  and are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers 
the loans we produce include term loans  demand loans  revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  and  to a lesser extent  loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration 
a broad range of c i loans  both collateralized and unsecured  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable  business expansion  the purchase of machinery and equipment  and other general corporate needs 
in determining the term and structure of a c i loan  several factors are considered  including its purpose  the collateral  and the anticipated sources of repayment 
c i loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower  and include financial covenants to monitor the borrower s financial stability 
the interest rates on c i loans can be fixed or floating  with floating rate loans being tied to prime or some other market index  plus an applicable spread 
our floating rate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest 
the decision to require a floor on c i loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions  the direction of market interest rates  and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower 
a benefit of c i lending is the opportunity to establish full scale banking relationships with our c i customers 
as a result  many of our borrowers provide us with deposits  and many take advantage of our fee based cash management  investment  and trade finance services 
the remainder of the portfolio of other loans consists primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit  as well as a variety of consumer loans  most of which were originated by our pre merger partners prior to their joining the company 
we currently do not offer home equity loans or lines of credit 
lending authority the loans we originate for investment are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies and procedures approved by the mortgage committee  the credit committee  and the respective boards of directors 
in accordance with the banks policies  all loans are presented to the mortgage committee or the credit committee  as applicable  for approval  and all loans of million or more are reported to the respective boards of directors 
in  loans of million or more were originated by the banks  with an aggregate loan balance of billion at origination 
in  loans of million or more were originated by the banks  with an aggregate loan balance at origination of billion 
at december   the largest amount of credit extended to a single borrower was million  of this amount  million had been funded at that date 
the loan was originated by the community bank on july  to the owner of a commercial property located in manhattan  and has been current since that date 
the interest rate on the loan was at december

table of contents non covered loans held for sale although one to four family loans represented of our total loans held for investment  we are actively engaged in the origination of one to four family loans for sale 
our mortgage banking business serves approximately clients community banks  credit unions  mortgage companies  and mortgage brokers who utilize our proprietary web accessible mortgage banking platform to originate full documentation  prime credit one to four family loans in all states 
in  we originated one to four family loans for sale of billion  reflecting a year over year increase of billion  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to refinancing activity and  to a lesser extent  home purchases  which were driven by the nearly year long decline in mortgage interest rates 
the vast majority of the held for sale loans we produced were agency conforming loans sold to gses 
to a much lesser extent  we utilized our mortgage banking platform to originate jumbo loans under contract for sale to other financial institutions 
at december  and  the respective balances of one to four family loans held for sale were billion and billion  representing and  respectively  of total loans at the corresponding dates 
to mitigate the risks inherent in originating and reselling residential mortgage loans  we utilize processes  proprietary technologies  and third party software application tools that seek to ensure that the loans meet investors program eligibility  underwriting  and collateral requirements 
in addition  compliance verification and fraud detection tools are utilized throughout the processing  underwriting  and loan closing stages to assist in the determination that the loans we originate and acquire are in compliance with applicable local  state  and federal laws and regulations 
controlling  auditing  and validating the data upon which the credit decision is made and the loan documents created substantially mitigates the risk of our originating or acquiring a loan that subsequently is deemed to be in breach of loan sale representations and warranties made by us to loan investors 
we require the use of our proprietary processes  origination systems  and technologies for all loans we close 
collectively  these tools and processes are known internally as our proprietary gemstone system 
by mandating usage of gemstone for all table funded loan originations  we are able to tightly control key risk aspects across the spectrum of loan origination activities 
our clients access gemstone via secure internet protocols  and initiate the process by submitting required loan application data and other required income  asset  debt  and credit documents to us electronically 
key data is then verified by a combination of trusted third party validations and internal reviews conducted by our loan underwriters and quality control specialists 
once key data is independently verified  it is locked down within the gemstone system to further ensure the integrity of the transaction 
in addition  all trusted source third party vendors are directly connected to the gemstone system via secure electronic data interfaces 
within the gemstone system  these trusted sources provide key risk and control services throughout the origination process  including ordering and receipt of credit report information  independent collateral appraisals  and private mortgage insurance  automated underwriting and program eligibility determinations  flood insurance determination  fraud detection  local state federal regulatory compliance  predatory or high cost loan reviews  and legal document preparation services 
our employees augment the automated system controls by performing audits during the process  which include the final underwriting of the loan file the credit decision  and various other pre funding and post funding quality control reviews 
both the agency conforming and non conforming ie  jumbo one to four family loans we originate for sale require that we make certain representations and warranties with regard to the underwriting  documentation  and legal regulatory compliance  and we may be required to repurchase a loan or loans if it is found that a breach of the representations and warranties has occurred 
in such case  we would be exposed to any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans that might or might not be realized in the future 
as governed by our agreements with the gses and other third parties to whom we sell loans  the representations and warranties we make relate to several factors  including  but not limited to  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan as of its closing date  the process used to select the loan for inclusion in a transaction  and the loan s compliance with any applicable criteria  including underwriting standards  loan program guidelines  and compliance with applicable federal  state  and local laws 
we record a liability for estimated losses relating to these representations and warranties  which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of condition 
the related expense is recorded in mortgage banking income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
at december  and december   the respective liabilities for estimated possible future losses 
table of contents relating to these representations and warranties were million and million 
the methodology used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  actual default experience  estimated future defaults  historical loan repurchase rates and the frequency and potential severity of defaults  probability that a repurchase request will be received  and the probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased 
the following table sets forth the activity in our representation and warranty reserve during the periods indicated representation and warranty reserve for the years ended december  in thousands balance  beginning of period provision for repurchase losses loan sales change in estimates balance  end of period because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses is dependent on economic factors  investor demand strategies  and other external conditions that may change over the lives of the underlying loans  the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate and requires considerable management judgment 
however  we believe the amount and range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our reserve is not material to our operations or to our financial condition or results of operations

table of contents outstanding loan commitments at december   we had outstanding loan commitments of billion  a year over year increase of million 
included in the current year end amount were commitments to originate loans for investment of billion and commitments to originate loans for sale of billion  as compared to billion and billion  respectively  at the prior year end 
multi family and cre loans together represented million of held for investment loan commitments at december   while adc loans and other loans represented million  and million  respectively 
in addition to loan commitments  we had commitments to issue financial stand by  performance  and commercial letters of credit totaling million at december   as compared to million at december  financial stand by letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions or municipalities  on behalf of certain of our current borrowers  and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation 
performance letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers 
these borrowers are mainly developers of residential subdivisions with whom we currently have a lending relationship 
performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under non financial contractual obligations 
commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer 
although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions  the majority are used to settle payments in international trade 
typically  such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction  and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title 
the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
asset quality non covered loans held for investment and non covered other real estate owned in  the quality of our assets improved from the year earlier level as our primary markets continued to recover  albeit slowly  from the economic crisis  enabling more of our delinquent borrowers to bring their loans current and facilitating the disposition and sale of certain foreclosed loans and properties 
specifically  non performing non covered loans declined million  or  year over year to million at december   representing of total non covered loans at that date 
at the prior year end  non performing non covered loans totaled million and represented of total non covered loans 
non performing multi family loans accounted for the bulk of this improvement  having declined million year over year to million 
non performing adc and cre loans declined million and million  respectively  from the balances at december   and non performing one to four family loans declined more modestly 
non accrual mortgage loans thus declined million year over year  to million  at december  the only offset was a million increase in the balance of non accrual other loans  to million  primarily reflecting non performance in the c i loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth the changes in non performing loans for the twelve months ended december  in thousands balance at december  new non accrual in the period charge offs transferred to other real estate owned loan payoffs  including dispositions and principal amortization restored to performing status balance at december  
table of contents a loan generally is classified as a non accrual loan when it is over days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  we cease the accrual of interest owed  and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income 
at december  and  all of our non performing loans were non accrual loans 
a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is less than days past due and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible 
we monitor non accrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area in the same manner 
monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and re appraising the collateral properties  holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and or retained legal counsel  as applicable  requesting financial  operating  and rent roll information  confirming that hazard insurance is in place or force placing such insurance  monitoring tax payment status and advancing funds as needed  and appointing a receiver  whenever possible  to collect rents  manage the operations  provide information  and maintain the collateral properties 
it is our policy to order updated appraisals for all non performing loans  irrespective of loan type  that are collateralized by multi family buildings  cre properties  or land  in the event that such a loan is more than days past due  and if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old 
appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status 
it is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans 
however  appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount  or when a borrower requests an extension of a maturing loan 
we do not analyze current ltv ratios on a portfolio wide basis 
non performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and reported on a monthly basis to the mortgage committee  the credit committee  and the boards of directors of the banks 
in accordance with our charge off policy  non performing loans are written down to their current appraised values  less certain transaction costs 
workout specialists from our loan workout unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment 
in addition  outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers 
properties that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as oreo  and are recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition  less the estimated cost of selling the property 
it is our policy to require an appraisal and environmental assessment of properties classified as oreo before foreclosure  and to re appraise the properties on an as needed basis until they are sold 
we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible  given current market conditions and the property s condition 
at december   oreo totaled million  reflecting a year over year reduction of million  or 
as a result  the balance of non performing assets improved to million at december  from million at december   a year over year reduction of 
non performing non covered assets thus represented and of total non covered assets at december  and  respectively 
the improvement in asset quality also was reflected in the improvement in loans to days past due at december  loans days past due totaled million at that date  in contrast to million at december   primarily reflecting a million decline in cre loans to days past due to million and a million decline in multi family loans to days past due to million 
in addition  the balance of to days past due adc loans fell million year over year  to million  while one to four family loans to days past due declined a more modest amount 
the reductions in loans to days past due were due to the migration of certain loans to non accrual status  certain other loans being brought current  and the general improvement in the local economy 
reflecting the improvement in non performing loans and the improvement in loans to days delinquent  total delinquencies declined million  or  year over year to million at december  to mitigate the potential for credit losses  we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider prudent 
in the case of multi family and cre loans  we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value  and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan 
the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values  with the economic value more typically used 

table of contents the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor 
multi family buildings and cre properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval by management and the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on multi family loans to be originated in excess of million 
similarly  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on cre loans to be originated in excess of million 
furthermore  independent appraisers  whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in house appraisal officers  perform appraisals on collateral properties 
when the amount of the loan exceeds million  a second independent appraisal is performed 
in addition  we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years 
furthermore  in new york city  where the majority of the buildings securing our multi family loans are located  the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain rent control or rent stabilization laws 
as a result  the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents 
buildings with a preponderance of such rent regulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity 
to further manage our credit risk  our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower  and typically require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of for multi family loans and for cre loans 
although we typically will lend up to of the appraised value on multi family buildings and up to on commercial properties  the average ltv ratios of such credits at origination were below those amounts at december  exceptions to these ltv limitations are reviewed on a case by case basis  and require the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties 
to minimize our credit risk  we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards  and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property s current income stream and debt service coverage ratio 
the approval of a loan also depends on the borrower s credit history  profitability  and expertise in property management 
although the reasons for a loan to default will vary from credit to credit  our multi family and cre loans  in particular  typically have not resulted in significant losses 
such loans are generally originated at conservative ltv ratios  as previously stated 
furthermore  in the case of multi family loans  the cash flows generated by the properties generally have significant value 
the boards of directors also take part in the adc lending process  with all adc loans requiring the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
in addition  a member of the pertinent committee participates in inspections when the loan amount exceeds million 
adc loans primarily have been made to well established builders who have borrowed from us in the past 
we typically lend up to of the estimated as completed market value of multi family and residential tract projects  however  in the case of home construction loans to individuals  the limit is 
with respect to commercial construction loans  which are not our primary focus  we typically lend up to of the estimated as completed market value of the property 
credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process 
loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses  and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and or consulting engineers 
our loan portfolio has been structured to manage our exposure to both credit and interest rate risk 
the vast majority of the loans in our portfolio are intermediate term credits  with multi family and cre loans typically repaying or refinancing within three to four years of origination  and the duration of adc loans ranging up to months  with to months more the norm 
furthermore  our multi family loans are largely secured by buildings with rent regulated apartments that tend to maintain a high level of occupancy  regardless of economic conditions in our marketplace 
c i loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrower s business  and are generally collateralized by various business assets  including  but not limited to  inventory  equipment  and accounts receivable 
as a result  the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful 
furthermore  the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time  may not be conducive to appraisal  and may fluctuate in value  based upon the operating results of the business 
accordingly  personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for c i loans 
the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories  with late charges assessed  and notices mailed to the borrower  at specified dates 
we attempt to reach the borrower by 
table of contents telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment 
when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property  we attempt to obtain full payment  and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action 
delinquencies are addressed by our loan workout unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings 
fair values for all multi family buildings  cre properties  and land are determined based on the appraised value 
if an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either non performing or as an accruing troubled debt restructuring tdr  then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value 
estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value 
in the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan  we adjust the original appraisal by using a third party index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received 
while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully  changes in the economy and market conditions  among other factors  can adversely impact a borrower s ability to repay 
in  net charge offs declined million  or  year over year  to million  during this time  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans improved to from 
in  multi family loans represented million of total net charge offs  while cre  adc  and other loans represented million  million  and million  respectively 
reflecting the million provision for losses on non covered loans recorded in and the year s net charge offs  our allowance for losses on non covered loans rose to million at the end of december from million at the prior year end 
the respective balances were equivalent to and of non performing non covered loans 
although our asset quality improved in  the allowance for losses on non covered loans was modestly increased to a level deemed sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
based upon all relevant and available information at the end of this december  management believes that the allowance for losses on non covered loans was appropriate at that date 
historically  our level of charge offs has been relatively low in adverse credit cycles  even when the volume of non performing loans has increased 
this distinction has largely been due to the nature of our primary lending niche multi family loans collateralized by non luxury apartment buildings in new york city that feature below market rents  and to our conservative underwriting practices that require  among other things  low ltv ratios 
reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure  a relatively small percentage of our non performing multi family loans have resulted in losses over time 
low ltv ratios provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit 
furthermore  in many cases  low ltv ratios result in our having fewer loans with a potential for the borrower to walk away from the property 
although borrowers may default on loan payments  they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status 
given that our cre loans are underwritten in accordance with underwriting standards that are similar to those that apply to our multi family credits  an increase in non performing cre loans historically has not resulted in a corresponding increase in losses on such loans 
in addition  at december   adc loans  other loans  and one to four family loans represented   and  respectively  of total non covered loans held for investment  as compared to   and  respectively  at the prior year end 
at the current year end    and of adc loans  other loans  and one to four family loans  respectively  were non performing loans 
in view of these factors  we do not believe that the level of our non performing non covered loans will result in a comparable level of loan losses and will not necessarily require a significant increase in our loan loss provision or allowance for non covered loans in any given period 
as indicated  non performing non covered loans represented of total non covered loans at december   the ratio of net charge offs to average loans for the twelve months ended at that date was

as of december   loans on which concessions were made with respect to rate reductions and or extension of maturity dates amounted to million  loans in connection with which forbearance agreements were reached amounted to million 
at december   the company had success rates for multi family  cre  and all other loans including adc loans of   and  respectively 
the eligibility of a borrower for work out concessions of any nature depends upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction  which may change from period to period  and involve judgment regarding the likelihood that the concession will result in the maximum recovery for the company 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as tdrs 
in general  a modification or restructuring of a loan constitutes a tdr if we grant a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
loans modified as tdrs are placed on non accrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months 
loans modified as tdrs totaled million at december   including accruing loans of million and non accrual loans of million

table of contents on a limited basis  we may lend additional credit to a borrower after the loan has been placed on non accrual status or modified as a tdr if  in management s judgment  the value of the property after the additional loan funding is greater than the initial value of the property plus the additional loan funding amount 
in  the number and amounts of such additions were immaterial 
in addition  the terms of our restructured loans typically would not restrict us from cancelling outstanding commitments for other credit facilities in the event of non payment of the restructured loan 
except for the non accrual loans  loans over days past due and still accruing interest  and tdrs disclosed in this filing  we did not have any potential problem loans at december  that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case

table of contents summary of the allowance for losses on non covered loans the following table sets forth the allocation of the consolidated allowance for losses on non covered loans at each year end in the five years ended december  at december   all of our loans were non covered loans 
dollars in thousands amount percent of loans in each category to total non covered loans held for investment amount percent of loans in each category to total non covered loans held for investment amount percent of loans in each category to total non covered loans held for investment amount percent of loans in each category to total non covered loans held for investment amount percent of loans in each category to total loans multi family loans commercial real estate loans acquisition  development  and construction loans one to four family loans other loans total loans the preceding allocation is based upon an estimate of various factors  as discussed in critical accounting policies earlier in this report  and a different allocation methodology may be deemed to be more appropriate in the future 
in addition  it should be noted that the portion of the allowance for losses on non covered loans allocated to each non covered loan category does not represent the total amount available to absorb losses that may occur within that category  since the total loan loss allowance is available for the entire non covered loan portfolio 

table of contents covered loans and covered other real estate owned the credit risk associated with the assets acquired in our amtrust and desert hills transactions has been substantially mitigated by our loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic agreed to reimburse us for of losses and share in of any recoveries up to a specified threshold with respect to the loans and oreo acquired in the transactions  and to reimburse us for of any losses and share in of any recoveries with respect to the acquired assets beyond that threshold 
the loss sharing and reimbursement agreements applicable to one to four family mortgage loans and helocs are effective for a ten year period from the date of acquisition 
under the loss sharing agreements applicable to other loans and oreo  the fdic will reimburse us for losses for a five year period from the date of acquisition  the period for sharing in recoveries on other loans and oreo extends for a period of eight years 
we consider our covered loans to be performing due to the application of the yield accretion method under asc  which allows us to aggregate credit impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools  provided that the loans have common risk characteristics 
a pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows 
accordingly  loans that may have been classified as non performing loans by amtrust or desert hills were no longer classified as non performing at the respective dates of acquisition because we believed at that time that we would fully collect the new carrying value of those loans 
the new carrying value represents the contractual balance  reduced by the portion expected to be uncollectible referred to as the non accretable difference and by an accretable yield discount that is recognized as interest income 
it is important to note that management s judgment is required in reclassifying loans subject to asc as performing loans  and is dependent on having a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of the cash flows to be collected  even if a loan is contractually past due 
in connection with the amtrust and desert hills loss sharing agreements  we established fdic loss share receivables of million and million  which were the acquisition date fair values of the respective loss sharing agreements ie  the expected reimbursements from the fdic over the terms of the agreements 
the loss share receivables may increase if the losses increase  and may decrease if the losses fall short of the expected amounts 
increases in estimated reimbursements will be recognized in income in the same period that they are identified and that the allowance for losses on the related covered loans is recognized 
in  indemnification income of million was recorded in non interest income as a result of an increase in expected reimbursements from the fdic under our loss sharing agreements 
this benefit partially offset a provision for losses on covered loans of million 
decreases in estimated reimbursements from the fdic  if any  will be recognized in income prospectively over the life of the related covered loans or  if shorter  over the remaining term of the loss sharing agreement 
related additions to the accretable yield on the covered loans will be recognized in income prospectively over the lives of the loans 
gains and recoveries on covered assets will offset losses  or be paid to the fdic at the applicable loss share percentage at the time of recovery 
the loss share receivables may also increase due to accretion  or decrease due to amortization 
in  we recorded net amortization of million and in we recorded net accretion of million 
accretion of the fdic loss share receivable relates to the difference between the discounted  versus the undiscounted  expected cash flows of covered loans subject to the fdic loss sharing agreements 
amortization occurs when the expected cash flows from the covered loan portfolio improves  thus reducing the amounts receivable from the fdic 
these cash flows were discounted to reflect the uncertainty of the timing and receipt of the loss sharing reimbursements from the fdic 
in the twelve months ended december   we received fdic reimbursements of million  as compared to million in the prior year

the investment policies of the company and the banks are established by the respective boards of directors and implemented by their respective investment committees  in concert with the respective asset and liability management committees 
the investment committees generally meet quarterly or on an as needed basis to review the portfolios and specific capital market transactions 
in addition  the securities portfolios are reviewed monthly by the boards of directors as a whole 
furthermore  the policies guiding the company s and the banks investments are reviewed at least annually by the respective investment committees  as well as by the respective boards 
while the policies permit investment in various types of liquid assets  neither the company nor the banks currently maintain a trading portfolio 
our general investment strategy is to purchase liquid investments with various maturities to ensure that our overall interest rate risk position stays within the required limits of our investment policies 
we generally limit our investments to gse obligations defined as gse certificates  gse collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  and gse debentures 
at december  and  gse obligations represented and  respectively  of total securities 
the remainder of the portfolio was comprised of private label cmos  corporate bonds  trust preferred securities  corporate equities  and municipal obligations 
we have no investment securities that are backed by subprime or alt a loans 
depending on management s intent at the time of purchase  securities are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
while available for sale securities are intended to generate earnings  they also represent a significant source of cash flows and liquidity for future loan production  the reduction of higher cost funding  and general operating activities 
these cash flows stem from the repayment of principal and interest  in addition to the sale of such securities 
held to maturity securities also generate cash flows from repayments and serve as a source of earnings 
securities that management intends to hold for an indefinite period of time are classified as available for sale 
a decision to purchase or sell these securities is based on economic conditions  including changes in interest rates  liquidity  and our asset and liability management strategy 
at december   available for sale securities represented million  or  of total securities  down from million  or  at the prior year end 
included in the respective year end amounts were mortgage related securities of million and million  and other securities of million and million  respectively

federal home loan bank stock the community bank and the commercial bank are members of the fhlb ny  one of regional fhlbs comprising the fhlb system 
each regional fhlb manages its customer relationships  while the fhlbs use their combined size and strength to obtain their necessary funding at the lowest possible cost 
as members of the fhlb ny  the community bank and the commercial bank are required to acquire and hold shares of its capital stock 
in addition  the community bank acquired shares of the capital stock of the fhlb cincinnati and the fhlb san francisco in connection with the amtrust and desert hills acquisitions  respectively 
at december   the community bank held million of fhlb stock  including million of stock in the fhlb ny  million of stock in the fhlb cincinnati  and million of stock in the fhlb san francisco 
the commercial bank had million of fhlb stock at december   all of which was with the fhlb ny 
fhlb stock continued to be valued at par  with no impairment required  at that date 
in and  dividends from the fhlb to the community bank totaled million and million  respectively 
dividends from the fhlb ny to the commercial bank were  and  respectively  in the corresponding years 
bank owned life insurance at december   our investment in bank owned life insurance boli was million  as compared to million at december  the increase reflects the purchase of additional boli totaling million in the fourth quarter  and the rise in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies over the course of the year 
boli is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the consolidated statements of condition  and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in non interest income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
fdic loss share receivable in connection with our loss sharing agreements with the fdic with respect to the loans and oreo acquired in the amtrust and desert hills acquisitions  we recorded fdic loss share receivables of million and million  respectively  at december  and the loss share receivables represent the present values of the reimbursements we expected to receive under the combined loss sharing agreements at those dates 
goodwill and core deposit intangibles we record goodwill and core deposit intangibles cdi in our consolidated statements of condition in connection with our various business combinations 
goodwill totaled billion at both december  and reflecting amortization  cdi declined million year over year  to million 
sources of funds the parent company ie  the company on an unconsolidated basis has four primary funding sources for the payment of dividends  share repurchases  and other corporate uses dividends paid to the company by the banks  capital raised through the issuance of stock  funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments  and repayments of  and income from  investment securities 
on a consolidated basis  our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources the deposits we gather through our branch network or acquire in business combinations  as well as brokered deposits  borrowed funds  primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings  the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans  and the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities 

table of contents loan repayments and sales totaled billion in  as compared to billion in repayments and sales accounted for billion and billion  respectively  of the total and for billion and billion  respectively  of the year earlier amount 
the increase in cash flows from sales is indicative of the aforementioned increase in the production of one to four family loans for sale during the year 
in  cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities respectively totaled billion and million  while purchases of securities totaled billion over the course of the year 
in  the cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaled billion and billion  respectively  and were partially offset by purchases of securities totaling billion 
consistent with our business model  the cash flows from loans and securities were primarily deployed into loan production and  to a much lesser extent  the purchase of gse obligations and other securities 
deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors  including customer satisfaction  the rates of interest we pay  the types of products we offer  and the attractiveness of their terms 
there are times we may choose not to compete aggressively for deposits  depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions  the availability of lower cost funding sources  the competitiveness of the market and its impact on pricing  and our need for such deposits to fund our loan demand 
while the vast majority of our deposits have been acquired through business combinations or gathered through our branch network  our mix of deposits has also included brokered deposits 
depending on the availability and pricing of such wholesale funding sources  we typically refrain from pricing our retail deposits at the higher end of the market  in order to contain or reduce our funding costs 
deposits rose from billion at december  to billion at december  while some of the growth in deposits was organic in nature  the increase also reflects deposits assumed in the aforementioned transaction with aurora bank 
at the time of the transaction  we acquired billion of deposits  including billion of brokered cds  million of retail cds  and million of retail money market accounts 
at december   the aurora bank transaction accounted for billion of total deposits  including brokered cds of million 
we had no brokered cds at the prior year end 
cds rose billion year over year  to billion  representing of total deposits at december  now and money market accounts represented billion of total deposits at that date  reflecting a modest year over year increase  while savings accounts and non interest bearing deposits rose more meaningfully 
at december   savings accounts and non interest bearing deposits respectively totaled billion and billion  reflecting year over year increases of million and million 
included in the year end balances of money market accounts and non interest bearing deposits were brokered deposits of billion and million  as compared to billion and million  respectively  at december  borrowed funds borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings ie  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  and federal funds purchased  junior subordinated debentures  and other borrowings consisting of preferred stock of subsidiaries and senior notes 
at december   borrowed funds totaled billion  reflecting a million reduction from the year earlier amount 
wholesale borrowings wholesale borrowings declined million year over year  to billion  representing of total assets at december  fhlb advances accounted for billion of the year end total  and were down million from the year earlier amount 
in addition to fhlb ny advances  the year end balance included fhlb cincinnati advances of million that were acquired in the amtrust acquisition in december the community bank and the commercial bank are both members of  and have lines of credit with  the fhlb ny 
pursuant to blanket collateral agreements with the banks  our fhlb advances and overnight advances are secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities 

table of contents also included in wholesale borrowings at december  were repurchase agreements of billion  consistent with the balance at the prior year end 
repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the banks with an agreement to repurchase those securities at agreed upon prices and dates 
our repurchase agreements are primarily collateralized by gse obligations  and may be entered into with the fhlb ny or certain brokerage firms 
the brokerage firms we utilize are subject to an ongoing internal financial review to ensure that we borrow funds only from those dealers whose financial strength will minimize the risk of loss due to default 
in addition  a master repurchase agreement must be executed and on file for each of the brokerage firms we use 
in late december  we began the process of repositioning certain wholesale borrowings 
reflecting the repositioning and the redemption of certain trust preferred securities at the end of december  we reduced the weighted average interest rate on billion of borrowed funds by basis points  and extended the weighted average call and maturity dates by approximately four years 
at december   billion of our wholesale borrowings were callable in  including billion that were subsequently repositioned in january given the current interest rate environment  we do not expect our callable wholesale borrowings to be called 
junior subordinated debentures reflecting the redemption of certain trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter  as mentioned  junior subordinated debentures declined million from the balance at december  to million at december  other borrowings other borrowings declined from million at december  to million at december  the reduction reflects the maturity of fixed rate senior notes that had been issued in under the temporary liquidity guarantee program on june  please see note  borrowed funds  in
