explanation of revenue restatement adjustments compared with information previously disclosed in our form k filed on march  on march   we filed a current report on form k form k stating our belief that the restatement would decrease previously reported revenues by approximately million and million for the fiscal year ended december  and the nine months ended september   respectively 
based upon our restated financial statements contained in this annual report  the actual restatement adjustments decreased previously reported revenues by million and million for the fiscal year ended december  and the nine months ended september   respectively 
the difference between the anticipated impact of the restatement to revenue discussed in our form k and the final restatement impact was primarily due to the determination to restate revenues related to two additional matters 
first  we have recorded a restatement adjustment to reclassify a million expense for a legal settlement with a customer from selling  general and administrative expense to contra revenue  which was the largest factor for the increase in the restatement of revenue for the fiscal year ended december  second  we restated revenues based upon our determination that a distributor had been given return rights and profit margin protection  at least with respect to certain transactions  which was the largest factor for the increase in the restatement of revenue for the nine months ended september  these additional items subject to restatement were discovered after march  as a result of the audit committee investigation and management comprehensive review of our financial records

table of contents part i item business introduction maxwell was incorporated under the name maxwell laboratories  inc in the company made an initial public offering of common stock in  and changed its name to maxwell technologies  inc in today  we develop  manufacture and market energy storage and power delivery products for transportation  industrial  information technology and other applications and microelectronic products for space and satellite applications 
our products are designed and manufactured to perform reliably with minimal maintenance for the life of the applications into which they are integrated 
we believe that this life of the application reliability gives our products a competitive advantage and enables them to command higher profit margins than commodity products 
we focus on the following lines of high reliability products ultracapacitors our primary focus is on ultracapacitors  energy storage devices that are characterized by high power density  long operational life and the ability to charge and discharge very rapidly 
our ultracapacitor products provide energy storage and power delivery solutions for applications in multiple industries  including transportation  automotive  information technology  renewable energy and industrial electronics 
high voltage capacitors our condis high voltage capacitors are designed and manufactured to perform reliably for decades in all climates 
these products include grading and coupling capacitors and capacitive voltage dividers that are used to ensure the safety and reliability of electric utility infrastructure and other applications involving transport  distribution and measurement of high voltage electrical energy 
radiation hardened microelectronic products our radiation hardened microelectronic products for satellites and spacecraft include single board computers and components  such as high density memory and power modules 
many of these products incorporate our proprietary radpak packaging and shielding technology and novel architectures that enable them to withstand the effects of environmental radiation and perform reliably in space 
general product line overview ultracapacitors ultracapacitors enhance the efficiency and reliability of devices or systems that generate or consume electrical energy 
they differ from other energy storage and power delivery products in that they combine rapid charge discharge capabilities typically associated with film and electrolytic capacitors with energy storage capacity generally associated with batteries 
although batteries store significantly more electrical energy than ultracapacitors  they cannot charge and discharge as rapidly and efficiently as ultracapacitors 
conversely  although electrolytic capacitors can deliver bursts of high power very rapidly  they have extremely limited energy storage capacity  and therefore cannot sustain power delivery for as much as a full second 
also  unlike batteries  which store electrical energy by means of a chemical reaction and experience gradual depletion of their energy storage and power delivery capability over hundreds to a few thousand charge discharge cycles  ultracapacitors energy storage and power delivery mechanisms involve no chemical reaction  so they can be charged and discharged hundreds of thousands to millions of times with minimal performance degradation 
this ability to store energy  deliver bursts of power and perform reliably for many years with little or no maintenance makes ultracapacitors an attractive energy efficiency option for a wide range of energy consuming and generating devices and systems 
based on potential volumes  we believe that the transportation industry represents the largest market opportunity for ultracapacitors 
transportation applications include braking energy recuperation and torque augmentation systems for hybrid electric buses  trucks and autos and electric rail vehicles  vehicle power network smoothing and stabilization  engine starting systems for internal combustion vehicles and burst power for stop start idle elimination systems 
our ultracapacitor products have become a standard and often preferred energy storage solution for transportation applications such as hybrid electric transit buses and electric rail systems and industrial electronics applications such as wind energy  automated utility meters in smart grid systems and backup power for telecommunications and information technology installations 
to reduce manufacturing cost and improve the performance of our ultracapacitor products  we developed a proprietary  solvent free  process to produce the carbon film electrode material which accounts for a significant portion of the cost of ultracapacitor cells 
this process has enabled us to become a low cost producer of electrode material  and our favorable cost position has enabled us to market electrode material to other ultracapacitor manufacturers 
although we do not intend to license this electrode technology to other ultracapacitor or electrode manufacturers  we have licensed our proprietary cell architecture to manufacturers in china  taiwan and korea to expand and accelerate acceptance of ultracapacitor products in large and rapidly growing global markets 

table of contents high voltage capacitors high voltage grading and coupling capacitors and capacitive voltage dividers are used mainly in the electric utility industry 
grading and coupling capacitors are key components of circuit breakers that prevent high voltage arcing that can damage switches  step down transformers and other equipment that transmits or distributes high voltage electrical energy in electric utility infrastructure and high voltage laboratories 
capacitive voltage dividers measure voltage and power levels in overhead transmission lines 
the market for these products consists of expansion  upgrading and maintenance of existing infrastructure and new infrastructure installations in developing countries 
such installations are capital intensive and frequently are subject to regulation  availability of government funding and general economic conditions 
for example  while north america has a large installed base of electric utility infrastructure  and has experienced power interruptions and supply problems  utility deregulation  government budget deficits  and other factors have limited recent capital spending in what historically has been a very large market for utility infrastructure components 
we believe that projects to increase the availability of electrical energy in developing countries and infrastructure modernization and renovation in developed countries may continue to drive increasing demand for our high voltage products in the years to come 
radiation hardened microelectronics radiation hardened microelectronic products are used almost exclusively in space and satellite applications 
because satellites and spacecraft are extremely expensive to manufacture and launch  and space missions typically span years or even decades  and because it is impractical or impossible to repair or replace malfunctioning parts  the industry demands electronic components that are virtually failure free 
as satellites and spacecraft routinely encounter ionizing radiation from solar flares and other natural sources  onboard microelectronic components must be able to withstand such radiation and continue to perform reliably 
for that reason  suppliers of components for space applications historically used only special radiation hardened silicon in the manufacture of such components 
however  since the space market is relatively small and the process of producing rad hard silicon is very expensive  only a few government funded wafer fabrication facilities are capable of producing such material 
in addition  because it takes several years to produce a rad hard version of a new semiconductor  components using rad hard silicon typically are several generations behind their current commercial counterparts in terms of density  processing power and functionality 
to address the performance gap between rad hard and commercial silicon and provide components with both increased functionality and significantly greater processing power  maxwell and a few other specialty components suppliers have developed shielding  packaging  and other radiation mitigation techniques that allow sensitive commercial semiconductors to withstand space radiation effects and perform as reliably as components incorporating rad hard semiconductors 
although this market is limited in size  the value proposition for high performance  radiation tolerant  components enables us to generate profit margins much higher than those for commodity electronic components 
business strategy our primary objective is to significantly increase the company s revenue and profit margins by creating and satisfying demand for ultracapacitor based energy storage and power delivery solutions 
to accomplish this  we are focusing on establishing and expanding market opportunities for ultracapacitors by collaborating with key existing and prospective customers to develop ultracapacitor based solutions for high volume and high value applications  demonstrating the efficiency  durability and safety of our ultracapacitor products through extensive internal and third party testing  integrating mathematical models for ultracapacitors into simulation software used by system designers  participating in a broad array of working groups  consortia and industry standards committees to disseminate knowledge of  and promote the use of  ultracapacitors  and manufacturing products that are environmentally compatible 
becoming a preferred ultracapacitor supplier by being a low cost producer and demonstrating ultracapacitors value proposition  designing and manufacturing products with life of the application durability  building a robust supply chain through global sourcing  
table of contents achieving superior performance and manufacturing quality while reducing product cost  developing and deploying enabling technologies and systems  including cell to cell and module to module balancing and integrated charging systems  among others  marketing high performance  low cost electrode material to other manufacturers  and establishing and maintaining broad and deep protections of key intellectual property 
we also seek to expand market opportunities and revenue for our high voltage capacitors and radiation hardened microelectronic products 
while these products have highly specialized applications  we are a technology leader in the markets they serve  and thus are able to sell our products at attractive profit margins 
to maintain and expand this competitive position we are leveraging our technological expertise to develop new products that not only meet the demands of our current markets  but also address additional applications 
for example  in  we introduced a line of high voltage capacitors and capacitive voltage dividers that operate at temperatures down to c for electric utility grid installations in regions that experience extremely low temperatures 
products and applications our products incorporate our know how and proprietary energy storage and power delivery and microelectronics technologies at both the component and system levels for specialized  high value applications that demand life of the application reliability 
ultracapacitors ultracapacitors  also known as electrochemical double layer capacitors edlc or supercapacitors  store energy electrostatically by polarizing an organic salt solution within a sealed package 
although ultracapacitors are electrochemical devices  no chemical reaction is involved in their energy storage mechanism 
their electrostatic energy storage mechanism is fully reversible  allowing ultracapacitors to be rapidly charged and discharged hundreds of thousands to millions of times with minimal performance degradation  even in the most demanding heavy charge discharge applications 
compared with electrolytic capacitors  which have very low energy storage capacity and discharge power too rapidly to be suitable for many power delivery applications  ultracapacitors have much greater energy storage capacity and can deliver energy over time periods ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes 
compared with batteries  which require minutes or hours to fully charge or discharge  ultracapacitors discharge and recharge in as little as fractions of a second 
although ultracapacitors store only about five to ten percent as much electrical energy as a battery of comparable size  they can deliver or absorb electric energy up to times more rapidly than batteries 
because they operate reliably through hundreds of thousands to millions of deep discharge cycles  compared with only hundreds to a few thousand equivalent cycles for batteries  ultracapacitors have significantly higher lifetime energy throughput  which equates to significantly lower cost on a life cycle basis 
we link our ultracapacitor cells together in multi cell modules to satisfy energy storage and power delivery requirements of varying voltages 
both individual cells and multi cell products can be charged from any primary energy source  such as a battery  generator  fuel cell  solar panel  wind turbine or electrical outlet 
virtually any device or system whose intermittent peak power demands are greater than its average continuous power requirement is a candidate for an ultracapacitor based energy storage and power delivery solution 
our ultracapacitor products have significant advantages over batteries  including the ability to deliver up to times more instantaneous power  significantly lower weight per unit of electrical energy stored  the ability to discharge deeper and recharge faster and more efficiently  minimizing energy loss  the ability to operate reliably and continuously in extreme temperatures c to c  minimal to no maintenance requirements  life of the application durability  and minimal environmental issues associated with disposal because they contain no heavy metals 

table of contents with no moving parts and no chemical reactions involved in their energy storage mechanism  ultracapacitors provide a simple  highly reliable  solid state like solution to buffer short term mismatches between power available and power required 
additionally  ultracapacitors offer the advantage of storing energy in the same form in which it is used  as electricity 
emerging applications  including increasing use of electric power in vehicles  wireless communication systems and growing demand for highly reliable  maintenance free  back up power for telecommunications  information technology and industrial installations are creating significant opportunities for more efficient and reliable energy storage and power delivery products 
in many applications  power demand varies widely from moment to moment  and peak power demand typically is much greater than the average power requirement 
for example  automobiles require times more power to accelerate than to maintain a constant speed  and forklifts require more power to lift a heavy pallet of material than to move from place to place within a warehouse 
engineers historically have addressed transient peak power requirements by over sizing the engine  battery or other primary energy source to satisfy all of a system s power demands  including demands that occur infrequently and may last only fractions of a second 
sizing a primary power source to meet brief peak power requirements  rather than for average power requirements  is costly and inefficient 
when a primary energy source is coupled with ultracapacitors  which can deliver or absorb brief bursts of high power on demand for periods of time ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes  the primary energy source can be smaller  lighter and less expensive 
the following diagram depicts the separation of a primary energy storage source from a peak power delivery component to satisfy the requirements of a particular application 
components that enable this separation allow designers to optimize the size  efficiency and cost of the entire electrical power system 
peak power application model

although batteries remain the most widely used component for both energy storage and peak power delivery  ultracapacitors  more advanced batteries and flywheels now enable system designers to separate and optimize these functions 
based in part on our ultracapacitor products declining cost  high performance and life of the application durability  they are becoming a preferred solution for many energy storage and power delivery applications 
we offer our ultracapacitors cells with capacitances ranging from to  farads 
applications such as hybrid electric bus  truck and auto drive trains  electric rail systems and ups systems require integrated energy storage systems consisting of up to hundreds of ultracapacitor cells 
to facilitate adoption of ultracapacitors for these larger systems  we have developed integration technologies  including proprietary electrical balancing and thermal management systems and interconnect technologies 
we hold patents for certain of these technologies 
we offer a broad range of standard multi cell modules to provide fully integrated solutions for applications requiring up to  volts of power 
our current standard multi cell products 
table of contents each incorporate from six to of our large cells to provide plug and play solutions for applications requiring from to volts 
in addition  our multi cell modules are designed to be linked together for higher voltage applications 
high voltage capacitors electric utility infrastructure includes switches  circuit breakers  step down transformers and measurement instruments that transmit  distribute and measure high voltage electrical energy 
high voltage capacitors are used to protect these systems from high voltage arcing 
with operational lifetimes measured in decades  these applications require high reliability and durability 
through our acquisition in of montena components ltd  now known as maxwell technologies sa  and its condis line of high voltage capacitor products  maxwell has more than years of experience in this industry  and is the world s largest producer of such products for use in utility infrastructure 
engineers with specific expertise in high voltage systems develop  design and test our high voltage capacitor products in our development and production facility in rossens  switzerland 
our high voltage capacitors are produced through a proprietary assembly and automated winding process to ensure consistent quality and reliability 
we have upgraded and expanded our high voltage capacitor production facility over the past five years to double its output capacity and significantly shorten order to delivery intervals 
we sell our high voltage capacitor products to large systems integrators  which install and service power plants and electrical utility infrastructure worldwide 
radiation hardened microelectronic products manufacturers of satellites and other spacecraft require microelectronic components and sub systems that meet specific functional requirements and can withstand exposure to gamma rays  hot electrons and protons and other environmental radiation encountered in space 
in the past  microelectronic components and systems for such special applications used only specially fabricated radiation hardened silicon 
however  the process of designing and producing rad hard silicon is lengthy and expensive  and there are only a few specialty semiconductor wafer fabricators  so supplies of rad hard silicon are limited 
therefore  demand for space qualified components made with higher performance  lower cost commercial silicon  protected by shielding and other radiation mitigation techniques  has grown 
producing our components and systems incorporating radiation protected commercial silicon requires expertise in power electronics  circuit design  silicon selection  radiation shielding and quality assurance testing 
we design  manufacture and market radiation hardened microelectronic products  including single board computers and components such as memory and power modules  for the space and satellite markets 
using highly adaptable  proprietary  packaging and shielding technology and other radiation mitigation techniques  we design and manufacture products that allow satellite and spacecraft manufacturers to use powerful  low cost  commercial semiconductors that are protected with the level of radiation mitigation required for reliable performance in the specific orbit or environment in which they are to be deployed 
manufacturing our internal manufacturing operations are conducted in production facilities located in san diego  california  and rossens  switzerland  and we are in the process of establishing a second us production facility in peoria  arizona  near phoenix 
we have made substantial capital investments to outfit and expand our internal production facilities and incorporate mechanization and automation techniques and processes 
we have trained our manufacturing personnel in advanced operational techniques  added information technology infrastructure and implemented new business processes and systems to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve efficiency  planning and product quality 
all of our ultracapacitor electrode material is currently produced at our san diego facility  where we have installed new electrode fabrication equipment that doubled production capacity between and by the end of  we plan to bring online additional electrode production capacity in peoria that will roughly match the current capacity of the san diego facility 
in  we outsourced assembly of our mm diameter large cell ultracapacitors  and subsequently  assembly of large cell based multi cell modules to belton technology group belton  a contract manufacturer based in shenzhen  china 
during the first quarter of  belton installed a new large cell assembly module that doubled its previous production capacity  and further capacity expansion is scheduled to be completed during in  we outsourced assembly of our mid size d cell ultracapacitor products and d cell based multi cell modules to the lishen battery company lishen  one of china s largest producer of lithium ion batteries  based in tianjin 
with the completion of the above noted electrode and large cell ultracapacitor capacity expansions  we believe that we will have sufficient capacity to meet near term demand for all of our product lines 

table of contents ultracapacitors we currently produce farad prismatic ultracapacitor cells and our new engine start module  on production lines in our san diego facility 
as noted above  we have outsourced assembly of all other cell types and multi cell modules to contract manufacturers in asia 
to reduce cost  simplify assembly and facilitate automation  we have redesigned our ultracapacitor products to incorporate lower cost materials and to reduce both the number of parts in a finished cell and the number of manufacturing process steps required to produce them 
we intend to continue using outsourced cell and module assembly to countries with low cost labor  but plan to continue to produce our proprietary electrode material only in internal production facilities to ensure protection of our intellectual property we produce electrode material for our own ultracapacitor products  and for sale to other ultracapacitor manufacturers  such as yeong long technologies co  ltd  yec and shanghai sanjiu electric equipment company  ltd  at our san diego headquarters location 
in  we completed the installation of an advanced carbon powder processing system as part of a major electrode capacity expansion in san diego  and we plan to install a similar system in our peoria arizona facility 
this new facility will give us sufficient capacity to support both our current ultracapacitor production requirements and external electrode demand in the near term 
as demand increases  additional increments of electrode production capacity can be added within a few months of placing an order with established equipment vendors 
we intend to continue producing this proprietary material internally  and do not contemplate licensing our solvent free electrode fabrication process to ultracapacitor electrode customers or competing suppliers of such material 
in  we formed an ultracapacitor manufacturing and marketing alliance with yec  an ultracapacitor manufacturer headquartered in taichung  taiwan  with sales operations in mainland china 
we entered into this alliance to accelerate commercialization of our ultracapacitor products in china  and to utilize yec s production capabilities for assembly of certain maxwell branded ultracapacitor products 
in  we expanded our relationship with yec to include supplying ultracapacitor electrode material produced in our san diego manufacturing facility to yec for incorporation into its own line of ultracapacitor products  and to assist yec in establishing worldwide distribution and marketing 
high voltage capacitors we produce our high voltage grading and coupling capacitors in our rossens  switzerland facility 
we believe we are the only high voltage capacitor producer that manufactures its products with stacking  assembly and automated winding processes 
this enables us to produce consistent  high quality and highly reliable products  and gives us sufficient capacity to satisfy anticipated global customer demand 
using advanced demand based techniques  we upgraded the assembly portion of the process to a cell based  just in time design in  doubling our production capacity without adding direct labor  and significantly shortening order to delivery intervals 
this upgrade and subsequent capacity expansion also enabled us to manufacture products for the capacitive voltage divider market  which we did not previously serve 
radiation hardened microelectronics products we produce our radiation hardened microelectronics products in our san diego production facility 
we have reengineered our production processes for microelectronic products  resulting in substantial reductions in cycle time and a significant increase in yield 
this facility maintains the qml v and qml q certifications issued by the department of defense procurement agency 
our microelectronics production operations include die characterization  packaging and electrical  environmental and life testing 
as a result of manufacturing cycle time reductions and operator productivity increases achieved over the past several years  we believe that this facility is capable of significantly increasing its current output with minimal additional direct labor or capital expenditure  and therefore  that we have ample capacity to meet foreseeable demand in the space and satellite markets 
suppliers we generally purchase components and materials  such as carbon powder  certain electronic components  dielectric materials  silicon die  and ceramic insulators from a number of suppliers 
for certain products  we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier for a number of reasons  including notably  the cost effectiveness of doing business with a single supplier 
although we believe there are alternative sources for some of the components and materials that we currently obtain from a single source  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and qualify alternative suppliers in a timely and cost effective manner 
therefore  for certain critical components  we utilize mitigation strategies such as  for example  maintaining an inventory of safety stock on our own premises in an effort to minimize the impact of an unforeseen disruption in supply from these outside parties 

table of contents marketing and sales we market and sell our products worldwide through both direct and indirect sales for integration by oem customers into a wide range of end products 
because the introduction of products based on emerging technologies requires customer acceptance of new and unfamiliar technical approaches  and because many oem customers have rigorous vendor qualification processes  the design in process and initial sale of our products often takes months or even years 
our principal marketing strategy is to identify applications for which our products and technology offer a competitive value proposition  to become a preferred vendor on the basis of service and price  and to negotiate supply agreements that enable us to establish long term relationships with key oem and integrator customers 
as these design in sales tend to be technical and engineering intensive  we organize customer specific teams composed of sales  applications engineering and other technical and operational personnel to work closely with our customers across multiple disciplines to satisfy their requirements for form  fit  function and environmental needs 
as time to market often is a primary motivation for our customers to use our products  the initial sale and design in process typically evolves into ongoing account management to ensure on time delivery  responsive technical support and problem solving 
we design and conduct discrete marketing programs intended to position and promote each of our product lines 
these include trade shows  seminars  advertising  product publicity  distribution of product literature  internet websites and social media 
we employ marketing communications specialists and outside consultants to develop and implement our marketing programs  design and develop marketing materials  negotiate advertising media purchases  write and place product press releases and manage our marketing websites 
we have an alliance with yec to assemble and market small cell ultracapacitor products 
in addition  we sell electrode material to yec  both for maxwell branded products and for incorporation into yec s own ultracapacitor products  and to shanghai sanjiu electric equipment company  which has licensed our large cell architecture and has introduced its own brand of ultracapacitor products in china 
competition each of our product lines has competitors  some of whom have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we have 
in some of the target markets for our emerging technologies  we face competition both from products utilizing well established  existing technologies and other novel or emerging technologies 
ultracapacitors our ultracapacitor products have two types of competitors other ultracapacitor suppliers and purveyors of energy storage and power delivery solutions based on batteries or other technologies 
although a number of companies are developing ultracapacitor products and technology  our principal competitors in the supply of ultracapacitor or supercapacitor products are panasonic  a division of matsushita electric industrial co  ltd  nesscap co  ltd  ls mtron  a unit of ls cable  and groupe bollore 
in the supply of ultracapacitor electrode material to other ultracapacitor manufacturers  our primary competitor is wl gore associates  inc the key competitive factors in the ultracapacitor industry are price  performance energy stored and power delivered per unit volume  durability and reliability  operational lifetime and overall breadth of product offerings 
we believe that our ultracapacitor products and electrode material compete favorably with respect to all of these competitive factors 
ultracapacitors also compete with products based on other technologies  including advanced batteries in power quality and peak power applications  and flywheels  thermal storage and batteries in back up energy storage applications 
we believe that ultracapacitors durability  long life  performance and value give them a competitive advantage over these alternative choices in many applications 
in addition  integration of ultracapacitors with some of these competing products may provide optimized solutions that neither product can provide by itself 
for example  tier auto parts supplier continental ag designed a combined solution incorporating ultracapacitors with a battery for engine starting in a stop start idle elimination system for micro hybrid autos that was introduced by french automaker psa peugeot citroen in  and has now been installed in more than  cars 
high voltage capacitors maxwell  through its acquisition in of montena components ltd  now known as maxwell technologies sa  and its condis line of high voltage capacitor products  is the world s largest producer of high voltage capacitors for use in electric utility infrastructure 
our principal competitors in the high voltage capacitor markets are in house production groups of certain of our customers and other independent manufacturers  such as the coil product division of trench limited in canada and 
table of contents europe and hochspannungsger te porz gmbh in germany 
we believe that we compete favorably  both as a consistent supplier of highly reliable high voltage capacitors  and in terms of our expertise in high voltage systems design 
over the last ten years  our largest customer has transitioned from producing its grading and coupling capacitors internally to outsourcing substantially all of its requirements to us 
radiation hardened microelectronic products our radiation hardened single board computers and components compete with the products of traditional radiation hardened integrated circuit suppliers such as honeywell corporation  lockheed martin corporation and bae systems 
we also compete with commercial integrated circuit suppliers with product lines that have inherent radiation tolerance characteristics  such as national semiconductor corporation  analog devices inc and temic instruments bv in europe 
our proprietary radiation hardening technologies enable us to provide flexible  high function  cost competitive  radiation hardened products based on the most advanced commercial electronic circuits and processors 
in addition  we compete with component product offerings from high reliability packaging houses such as austin semiconductor  inc  microsemi corporation and teledyne microelectronics  a unit of teledyne technologies  inc research and development we maintain active research and development programs to improve existing products and develop new products 
for the year ended december   our research and development expenditures totaled approximately million  compared with million and million in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
in general  we focus our research and product development activities on designing and producing products that perform reliably for the life of the end products or systems into which they are integrated  making our products less expensive to produce so as to improve our profit margins and to enable us to reduce prices so that our products can penetrate new  price enabled applications  designing our products to have superior technical performance  designing our products to be compact and light  and designing new products that provide novel solutions to expand our market opportunities 
most of our current research  development and engineering activities are focused on material science  including activated carbon  electrolyte  electrically conducting and dielectric materials  ceramics and radiation tolerant silicon and ceramic composites to reduce cost and improve performance  reliability and ease of manufacture 
additional efforts are focused on product design and manufacturing engineering and manufacturing processes for high volume manufacturing 
ultracapacitors the principal focus of our ultracapacitor development activities is to increase power and energy density  reduce internal resistance  extend operational life and reduce manufacturing cost 
our ultracapacitor designs focus on low cost  high capacity cells in standard sizes ranging from to  farads  and corresponding multi cell modules based on various form factors 
high voltage capacitors the principal focus of our high voltage capacitor development efforts is to enhance performance and reliability while reducing the size  weight and manufacturing cost of our products 
we also are directing our design efforts to develop high voltage capacitors for additional applications 
microelectronic products the principal focus of our microelectronics product development activities is on circuit design  shielding and other radiation hardening techniques that allow the use of powerful commercial silicon components in space and satellite applications that require ultra high reliability 
we also focus on creating system solutions that overcome the basic failure mechanisms of individual components through architectural approaches  including redundancy  mitigation and correction 
this involves expertise in system architecture  including algorithm and microcode development  circuit design and the physics of radiation effects on silicon electronic components 

table of contents intellectual property we place a strong emphasis on inventing  protecting and exploiting proprietary technologies  processes and designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio 
in an effort to assist in protecting this added value and uniqueness  we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection for those products and related technologies 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing patents  secure additional patent protection in a manner that strengthens our overall patent portfolio and develop new technologies  processes and designs not currently claimed by the patents of third parties 
as of december   we held issued us patents and pending us patent applications which relate to our core technologies  processes and designs 
of these issued patents  relate to our ultracapacitor products and technology  six relate to our high voltage capacitor products and technology  and relate to our microelectronics products and technology 
our pending patent applications and any future patent applications may not be allowed by the specific patent offices around the world in which we are seeking patents on advanced technologies and products 
we routinely seek to protect our new developments and technologies by applying for patents in jurisdictions in which we strive to obtain a market advantage  including  most commonly  the united states and the principal countries of europe and asia 
at present  with the exception of microcode architectures within our radiation hardened microelectronics product line  we do not rely on licenses from any third parties to produce our products 
our existing patent portfolios and pending patent applications relate primarily to ultracapacitors compositions of the electrode  including its formulation  design and fabrication techniques  physical cell package designs as well as the affiliated processes used in cell assembly  cell to cell and module to module interconnect technologies that minimize equivalent series resistance and enhance the functionality  performance and longevity of ultracapacitor products including system level electronics  and module and system designs that facilitate applications of ultracapacitor technology 
microelectronics system architectures that enable commercial silicon products to be used in radiation intense space environments  technologies and designs that improve packaging densities while mitigating the effect of radiation on commercial silicon  radiation mitigation techniques that improve performance while protecting sensitive commercial silicon from the effects of environmental radiation in space  and fault tolerant computer systems with a plurality of processors which avoid deficiencies typically experienced by similar systems due to ionizing radiation 
high voltage capacitors manufacture of capacitors in a manner which significantly reduces exposure of internal components to impurities  moisture and other undesirable materials in an effort to avoid longer manufacturing times and reduced performance characteristics without these technical advancements 
historically  our high voltage capacitor products have been based on our know how and trade secrets rather than on patents 
we filed our first patent application covering our high voltage capacitor technology in  and we continue to pursue patent protection in addition to trade secret protection of certain aspects of our products design and production 
while our primary strategy for protecting our proprietary technologies  processes and designs is related to obtaining patents  we also apply for trademark registrations which identify the source of the products with the company 
additionally  we promote our technologies  processes and designs in association with these registered trademarks to further distinguish our products from those of our competitors 
as of december   we had eleven formal trademark registrations within the us establishing and protecting proprietary products and technologies is a key element of our corporate strategy 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent infringement  misappropriation or other misuse by third 
table of contents parties  or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us we use employee and third party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know how 
we require each of our employees to enter into a proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreement in which the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all our proprietary information and  subject to certain exceptions  to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment with us 
in addition  we regularly enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties  such as potential product development partners and customers  to protect any information disclosed in the pursuit of securing possible fruitful business endeavors

as a result  our business will continue to be subject to certain risks  such as those imposed by foreign government regulations  export controls  and changes in tax laws  tax treaties  tariffs and freight rates 
to the extent 
table of contents that we are unable to respond effectively to political  economic and other conditions in the countries where we operate and do business  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 
even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations  our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 
having substantial international operations also increases the complexity of managing our financial reporting and internal controls and procedures 
additionally  as a result of our extensive international operations and significant revenue generated outside the us  the dollar amount of our current and future revenues  expenses and debt may be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
similarly  assets and liabilities of our swiss subsidiary that are not denominated in its functional currency are subject to effects of currency fluctuations  which may affect our reported earnings 
also  changes in the mix of income from our domestic and foreign operations  expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws and regulations could increase our tax expense 
if we are unable to manage these risks effectively  it could impair our ability to achieve our targets for revenues and profitability 
as a result of our international operations  we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business  as well as the anti bribery laws of other jurisdictions 
as previously disclosed in our periodic filings  we conducted an internal review beginning in regarding payments made to our former independent sales agent in china with respect to sales of our high voltage capacitor products produced by our swiss subsidiary 
these payments violated the fcpa 
in january  we settled charges with the securities and exchange commission sec and department of justice doj related to this matter 
in addition to a monetary settlement  the company will periodically report to the sec and doj on the company s internal compliance program concerning anti bribery 
backlog product backlog as of december  was approximately million  compared with million as of december  backlog consists of firm orders for products that will be delivered within months 
the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects as this amount is impacted by a number of factors including potential cancellations of orders by our customers 
significant customers one customer  shenzhen xinlikang supply china management co 
ltd  accounted for of revenues for the year ended december  there were no sales to one customer amounting to more than of our total revenue for the years ended december  and government regulation due to the nature of our operations and the use of hazardous substances in some of our manufacturing and research and development activities  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing workplace safety and environmental protection 
these include the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
in the course of our historical operations  materials or wastes may have spilled or been released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials and wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties and the materials and wastes spilled  released  or disposed thereon are subject to environmental laws that may impose strict liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  for remediation of contamination resulting from such releases 
under such laws and regulations  we could be required to remediate previously spilled  released  or disposed substances or wastes  or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations also could result in the assessment of substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties and even the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our activities 
it is also possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as well as the industry in general 
while we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations  we cannot be certain that we will not incur substantial costs in the future 
in addition  certain of our microelectronics products are subject to international traffic in arms export regulations when they are sold to customers outside the us we routinely obtain export licenses for such product shipments outside the us 
table of contents employees as of december   we had employees in five countries  as follows full time  two part time and temporary employees in the us  full time  part time and temporary employees in switzerland  full time employees in china  seven full time employees in germany  and one full time employee in the united kingdom 
we are unable to estimate the percent of our swiss employees that are members of a labor union  as swiss law prohibits employers from inquiring into the union status of employees

table of contents item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed if potentially adverse developments  some of which are described below  materialize and cannot be resolved successfully 
in any such case  the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also result in decreased revenues  increased expenses or other adverse impacts that could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
a substantial percentage of our total revenue depends on the sale of products within a small number of vertical markets and a small number of geographic regions  and the decline in the size of a vertical market or reduction of consumption within a geographic region  could impede our growth and profitability 
sales within a relatively small number of vertical markets and a small number of geographic regions make up a large portion of our revenues 
our ability to grow our sales within this limited number of markets and regions depends on our ability to compete on price  delivery and quality 
for example  our microelectronics products are primarily used within the space industries 
within the space community there are a limited number of customers for our products and each customer represents a significant portion of our revenue 
if our relationships with such large customers are disrupted  we could lose a significant portion of our anticipated revenue 
factors that could influence our relationships with our customers include our ability to sell our products at prices that are competitive with competing suppliers  our ability to maintain features and quality standards for our products sufficient to meet the expectations of our customers  our ability to produce and deliver a sufficient quantity of our products in a timely manner to meet our customers requirements  and our financial condition and perceived viability as a long term supplier 
similarly  we currently sell our products into a small number of vertical markets 
if a particular market into which we sell experiences a decline  then our customers will decrease their own consumption of our products thereby reducing our revenues 
for example  if consumers are no longer accepting of start stop systems within passenger automobiles  then our direct customers will no longer consume products from us for incorporation into such applications 
additionally  a substantial portion of our revenues stems from sales to customers within a limited number of geographic regions including  notably  china and germany 
collectively  over half of our revenues in were from customers situated in china or germany 
if certain factors were to arise including  for example  a catastrophic event or shift in economic health and stability within a particular region  then customers within these regions may reduce their consumption of our products resulting in reduced revenues for us 
many of our customers are currently the benefactors of government funding or government subsidies 
our products are currently sold into a limited number of vertical markets  some of which are either directly funded by or partially subsidized with government funding 
our ultracapacitor products provide numerous technology and environmental benefits for many of the applications in which our customers are using these products 
as the use of our technology in certain applications is still relatively immature  the costs associated with producing the products is high as compared with the more mature solutions 
however  many government entities have determined that they view certain prevailing interests  including  for example  reduction of pollution  to outweigh the economic costs associated with incorporating these clean technologies and therefore are willing to allocate government funding to encourage companies to produce goods which reduce pollution and energy consumption 
similarly  our microelectronics and high voltage capacitor products are consumed by markets which are either directly funded by or controlled by the respective government bodies in the jurisdictions where our customers do business 
for example  our microelectronics products are used in the space community which is ultimately run by the space agencies of the respective governments 
likewise  our high voltage capacitor products are largely used for electric utility infrastructures which are largely controlled by the respective governments supplying power and electricity to its populations 
if these government entities elect to change their policies on government subsidies or decide to cancel or reduce certain government funding programs  then our customers could cancel or reduce orders for our products 
downward pressures on gross margin could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results or even result in loss of revenue in exchange for avoidance of such gross margin pressures 
we strive to manage gross margin for the products we sell 
there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved 
in general  gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to increased competition as well as a potential shift in our sales mix with respect to low margin business and high margin business 
for example  if we increase sales of our products into markets which traditionally have lower margin rates than our current business  such as the automotive and consumer markets  we may be forced to reduce our margins to remain competitive in 
table of contents these markets 
if we continue to pursue these markets and reduce our margins to increase sales  then we could experience degradation in our overall profit margins 
gross margins could also be affected by our ability to stimulate demand for our products 
in addition  gross margins could be negatively impacted by an increase in raw materials  components and labor costs 
our business is subject to risks related to its international operations including the risk that we will be unable to adequately comply with the changing rules and regulations in countries where our business is conducted 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from international operations 
such operations outside the us are subject to special risks and restrictions  including fluctuations in currency values and foreign currency exchange rates  import and export requirements and trade policy  anti corruption laws  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions  data privacy requirements  labor laws  anti competition regulations  and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad 
compliance with these us and foreign laws and regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions and these costs may continue to increase in the future as a result of changes in such laws and regulations or in their interpretation 
furthermore  we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  but there can be no assurance that our employees  contractors  or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies 
any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 
even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations  our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 
our success could be negatively impacted if we fail to control  oversee and direct foreign subsidiaries and their operations 
we currently own foreign subsidiaries located within europe and asia where the employees and cultures represent certain vast differences from employees and cultures within the united states where our corporate headquarters is situated 
while the cultural values and philosophies of the people located in europe and portions of asia are generally viewed to be in alignment with that of us persons  there are still some significant differences 
for example  the respective european data privacy laws take a harsher position regarding the protection of employee personal data and  consequently  there is less information shared with the us parent corporation regarding employees working for our european subsidiaries 
additionally  the human resources and the systems our foreign entities use can be vastly different  notably  our swiss  german  korean  and chinese subsidiaries utilize a primary language other than english for communications 
our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from international operations could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non us dollar denominated sales in europe as well as non us dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world 
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will adversely affect the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings  and generally will lead us to raise international pricing  potentially reducing demand for our products 
in some circumstances  due to competition or other reasons  we may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent to offset unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations  or at all  which would adversely affect the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings 
conversely  a strengthening of foreign currencies  while generally beneficial to our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings  could cause us to realize a reduction in our overall gross margin as the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated expenses increases 
our business activities are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anti bribery laws  as well as the restrictions agreed to in our respective settlements with the securities and exchange commission sec and department of justice doj 
if we fail to comply with anti bribery laws and regulations or the terms of either settlement agreement  we could be subject to civil and or criminal penalties as well as further expenses related to an additional internal investigation 
due to our status as a us issuer  we are subject to the fcpa  which prohibits companies from making  promising or offering improper payments or other things of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or a business advantage 
during and  we conducted an internal review into the nature of certain payments made to an independent third party sales agent in china with respect to sales of our high voltage capacitor products produced by our swiss subsidiary  maxwell sa 
according to court documents  maxwell sa engaged a chinese agent to sell products in china  and  from at least july through may  paid more than million to this agent to secure contracts with chinese customers 
the agent in 
table of contents turn used maxwell sa money to influence officials at state owned entities in connection with sales contracts 
in its books and records  the company mischaracterized the payments as sales commission expenses 
in january  we reached settlements with the sec and doj with respect to charges asserted by the sec and doj relating to this matter 
we settled civil charges with the sec  agreeing to an injunction against further violations of the fcpa 
under the terms of the settlement with the sec  we paid a total of approximately million in profit disgorgement and prejudgment interest  in two installments  with million paid in each of the first quarters of and as part of the settlement with the doj  we entered into a three year deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the doj  under which we paid a total of million in penalties in three installments  with million paid in the first quarter of and million paid in each of the first quarter of and if we remain in compliance with the terms of the dpa  at the conclusion of the three year term  the charges against us brought by the doj will be dismissed with prejudice 
further  under the terms of each of the agreements  we will periodically report to the sec and doj  respectively  on our internal compliance program concerning anti bribery 
our failure to comply with any terms or conditions of the respective settlement agreements  including  notably  payment obligations or ongoing compliance obligations  could result in additional criminal and or civil penalties as well as continued expenses related to additional investigations and defense costs for addressing such non compliance 
we depend upon component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties  many of whom are located outside of the us substantially all of our components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third party manufacturers 
many of these manufacturers are located outside of the us  but are concentrated in a few general locations 
we have also outsourced much of our transportation and logistics management 
while these arrangements may lower operating costs  they also reduce our direct control over production and distribution 
such diminished control could have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of our products as well as our flexibility to respond to changing conditions 
in addition  we rely on third party manufacturers to adhere to the terms and conditions of the agreements in place with each party 
for example  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  we may remain responsible to the customer for warranty service in the event of product defects 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect our reputation  financial condition and operating results 
to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand  we must introduce and commercialize new products successfully as well as adequately educate our prospective customers on the products we offer 
our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on our ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace 
we believe that we are unique in that we are the technology leader for the technologies we deliver and typically must first educate the customer regarding the implementation of our solution in their systems before the customer is capable of designing in our products 
as a result  we must make significant investments in research and development efforts as well as sales and marketing efforts  including applications engineering resources 
by contrast  many of our competitors  including some which are well capitalized with significant financial resources at their disposal  seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures 
if we are unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products or if we are unable to effectively educate the prospective customer on the value proposition offered by the implementation of our products  then our ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
competition in the energy storage domain has significantly affected  and will continue to affect  our sales 
many companies are engaged in or are starting to engage in designing  developing and producing energy storage solutions as a consequence of the movement towards clean energy solutions in both the commercial and public sectors 
consequently  more companies are pursuing opportunities in the energy storage domain and are beginning to compete in the markets in which we do business 
the success of these new competitors could render our products less competitive  resulting in reduced sales compared with our expectations or past results 
certain companies which recently initiated efforts to enter the markets in which we do business possess greater access to capital resources  including resources available through government funding  to deploy in the development and advancement of products and  consequently  these companies could develop products that are superior to ours 
additionally  significant amounts of us government funds are being invested in the development of batteries with better performance characteristics or lower manufacturing costs than battery technologies currently on the market 
an increasing number of parties are submitting proposals for and receiving this government funding and  consequently  these new  advanced batteries that include power delivery functionality could compete for market share with our ultracapacitor products 
additionally  as the market leader for certain markets for energy storage  competitors often follow our lead in the advancement of technologies for energy storage  thereby requiring us to innovate rapidly in order to continue to serve as the market leader 

table of contents the success of the products offered by our competitors could reduce our market share  thereby negatively impacting our financial results 
the successful management of new market applications and new product introductions will be necessary for our growth 
given our position as the technology leader for certain products and solutions we offer  we have a considerable number of new product concepts in the pipeline 
a critical component of our growth strategy is dependent upon our ability to effectively and accurately determine which new products or applications to pursue 
pursuing product applications targeted at a specific customer base should enable our products to cross over from a more narrow range of acceptance by early technology adopters to acceptance by a majority of customers in the application space 
commercial success frequently depends on being the first provider to identify the market opportunities for which a product is a solution to an unsolved problem within a particular market 
consequently  if we are not able to fund our research and development activities appropriately and deliver new products which address the needs of the markets we serve on a timely basis  our growth prospects will be harmed 
additionally  we must balance the benefits of gaining market acceptance in new or existing markets with the goal of optimizing growth and profitability 
that is  it is critical to ensure that the products and markets we select for development are aimed at large volume or high profile applications which can provide a significant return on our investment 
if we fail to identify and pursue the appropriate markets for our products  our growth potential and operating results could be adversely affected 
our success depends largely on the acquisition of  as well as the continued availability and service of  key personnel 
much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel  including our senior executive management team as well as highly skilled employees in technical  marketing and staff positions 
due to the complexity and immaturity of the technologies involved in the products we produce and the markets we serve  we may be unable to find the right personnel with the background needed to serve our goals and objectives 
as the market leader for the technologies we develop  there are limited opportunities to hire personnel from competitors or from companies who have worked closely with similar or identical technology 
consequently  we seek to hire individuals who are capable of performing well in an environment with limited resources and references to past experiences 
we may struggle to find such gifted personnel who also thrive in a high growth business atmosphere and who are capable of keeping pace with the rapidly changing environment encouraged by the technologies we create and the markets we serve 
these uniquely talented personnel are in high demand in the technology industry and competition for acquiring such individuals is intense 
some of our scientists and engineers are the key developers of our products and technologies and are recognized as leaders in their area of expertise 
without first attracting the personnel with the appropriate baseline skill sets and then retaining such personnel  we could fail to maintain our technological and competitive advantage 
our inability to manage rapid growth in personnel  including development and training of such personnel in an immature industry  as well as to map out succession planning  could impede our success 
our business has grown rapidly 
this growth has placed  and any future growth would continue to place  a significant strain on our limited personnel  management and other resources 
also  due to the learning curve associated with the immature products and services provided by us and the anticipated rapid growth of demand for our product  we face risks related to managing personnel in such a growth environment 
we may fail to accurately gauge the growth in personnel required at the appropriate time without incurring the additional cost and expense of the additional personnel before they are needed 
we will also need to determine how to best add this new talent and transfer information and know how without sacrificing the ongoing demands of the business 
for example  each new hire will need to learn quickly about our products and technologies 
since there is limited information available in the public domain  this information will need to be passed from existing personnel to new personnel all while the existing personnel continue to complete their ongoing job duties 
additionally  our ability to grow management talent below the senior executive level will be imperative to achieving our goals 
in a smaller organization  the senior executive management team is capable of handling and being involved in several tasks and decision making forums 
however  once the company makes significant progress toward meeting its growth targets  the time constraints will be felt more severely by the senior executive team and some of the tasks they are currently capable of handling on their own will need to be transferred to the management team reporting to them 
accordingly  growing the next level of management and identifying key personnel for succession planning will become critical to our ongoing success 
our success as a reliable supplier to our customers is highly dependent upon our ability to effectively manage our reliance upon certain suppliers of key component parts and specialty equipment 
because we currently obtain certain key components including  but not limited to carbon  binder  separator  paper  aluminum piece parts  die  printed circuit boards and certain finished goods from single or limited sources  we are subject to significant supply and pricing risks 
if the particular supplier is unable to provide the appropriate quantity and or quality of the 
table of contents raw material at the prices required  then we will be unable to produce and deliver our finished goods to customers thereby losing out on revenue generation and  potentially  incurring penalties for failing to timely perform 
additionally  we use some custom components that are not common to the rest of the industries served by our suppliers and which are often available from only one source 
also  when a component or product uses new technologies  initial capacity constraints may exist until the particular supplier yield has matured or manufacturing capacity has increased 
continued availability of these components at acceptable prices  or at all  may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet our unique requirements 
if the supply of a key single sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained  if such components were available only at significantly higher prices  or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to us  then our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
conversely  diversifying our supplier base to ensure that we have multiple suppliers for each key raw material typically involves additional costs including  but not limited to higher prices for the raw materials as a direct consequence of purchasing lower volumes from each supplier  additional costs associated with qualifying additional suppliers  and increased resource expense in managing an additional supplier for factors including quality  timely delivery and other standards 
if we fail to balance the interests between the reliance upon a single supplier and expense associated with diversifying the supply chain base  then our actual gross profit could fail to meet our targets 
our products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that could result in decreased sales and operating margin  and could tarnish our reputation 
in the case of our ultracapacitor products  we sell relatively new technology which could contain defects in design and manufacture 
as a direct consequence of the immaturity of this technology  we are still learning about the technology and its potential quality issues which could arise during operation 
additionally  we are still learning  along with our customers  how the products will operate in the systems into which our customers are incorporating the products 
consequently  we are not always capable of anticipating the defects or quality problems the products are likely to experience in the field 
products sold into high performance environments such as heavy transportation and automotive markets could experience additional operating characteristics that could unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of our products 
with this sometimes limited understanding of the applicability and operation of our products in varying end user applications  we also strive to respond quickly in modifying the products to accommodate such concerns 
as such  the release time of next generation products is relatively short thereby forcing us to assume additional risks associated with expediting the release of new or modified products 
we are also building our infrastructure to adequately and efficiently handle any potential recall and the reverse logistics involved in returning our products to our facilities in the event that any defects are found 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the products we sell or will be able to efficiently handle all issues related to product returns 
failure to do so could result in lost revenue  harm to our reputation  and significant warranty and other expenses  and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
efforts to protect our intellectual property rights and to defend claims against us could increase our costs and will not always succeed  any failures could adversely affect sales and profitability and restrict our ability to do business 
intellectual property ip rights are crucial to maintaining our competitive advantage and growing our business 
we endeavor to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights which we feel will allow us to retain or advance our competitive advantage in the marketplace 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of ip which are strategic to our business 
generally  when strategic ip rights are identified  we will seek formal protection in jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used  jurisdictions in which competitors are producing or importing their products  and jurisdictions into which our products are imported 
different nations may provide limited rights and inconsistent duration of protection for our products 
additionally  we may be unable to obtain protection for or defend our ip in key jurisdictions 
for example  the patent prosecution and enforcement system within china is less mature than the systems in other jurisdictions and therefore we may be less able to enforce our rights 
specifically  it would be challenging for us as a foreign entity to seek protection in china against a chinese company infringing on our ip 
even if protection is obtained  competitors or others in the chain of commerce may raise legal challenges to our rights or illegally infringe our rights  including through means that may be difficult to prevent or detect 
for example  a certain portion of our ip portfolio is related to unique process steps performed during the manufacture of our products which are not readily recognizable in the physical embodiment of the final product 
it may be difficult to identify and prove that a competitor is infringing on our rights to such process steps 
further  we are required to divulge certain of our ip to our business partners to enable them to provide quality products or raw materials to us in order for us to accomplish our business goals 
to the extent that such disclosure occurs in china or other jurisdictions in which the ability to protect ip is more limited  existing or new competitors in this region could begin to use our ip in the development of their own products  which could reduce our competitive edge 
even in jurisdictions in which ip is highly valued  and therefore protected  the financial burden of asserting 
table of contents or defending our ip rights could prove to be cost prohibitive for us thereby putting us in a position in which we must sacrifice our competitive edge 
in addition  because of the rapid pace of technology advancements  and the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions  competitors may be issued patents stemming from pending patent applications that were unknown to us prior to issuance of the patents 
this could reduce the value of our commercial or pipeline products or  to the extent they cover key technologies on which we have unknowingly relied  require that we seek to obtain a license or cease using the technology  no matter how valuable to our business 
we may not be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms 
the extent to which we succeed or fail in our efforts to protect our intellectual property will affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to effectively identify  enter into  manage and benefit from strategic alliances  may limit our ability to pursue certain growth objectives and or strategies 
our reputation is important to our growth and success 
as a leader in an emerging technology industry  we recognize the value in identifying  selecting and managing key strategic alliances 
we are mainly focusing our business on the specific products we deliver and pursuit of strategic alliances with other companies could allow us to provide customers with integrated or other new products  services  or technology advancements derived from the alliances 
to be successful  we must first be able to define and identify opportunities which align with our growth plan 
additionally  we cannot be certain that our alliance partners will provide us with the support we anticipate  that such alliance or other relationships will be successful in developing our technology for use with their intended products  or that any alliances or other relationships will be successful in manufacturing and marketing integrated products 
our success is also highly dependent upon our ability to manage the respective parameters of all strategic alliances  promote the benefits to us  and to not prohibit or discourage other opportunities which may be beneficial to us in the future 
also  certain provisions of alliance agreements may include restrictions that limit our ability to independently pursue or exploit the developments under such strategic alliances 
currently  we have alliances with several partners both in the us and throughout the world 
we anticipate that future alliances may also be with foreign partners or entities 
as a result  such alliances may be subject to the political climate and economies of the foreign countries where such partners reside and operate 
if the strategic alliances we pursue are not successful  our business and prospects could be negatively affected 
should a catastrophic event or other significant business interruption occur at any of our facilities  we could face significant reconstruction or remediation costs  penalties  third party liability and loss of production capacity  which could adversely affect our business 
weather conditions  natural disasters or other catastrophic events could cause significant disruptions in operations  including  specifically  disruptions at our manufacturing facilities or those of our major suppliers or customers 
in turn  the quality  cost and volumes of the products we produce and sell could be unexpectedly  negatively affected  which will impact our sales and profitability 
natural disasters or industrial accidents could also damage our manufacturing facilities or infrastructure  or those of our major suppliers or major customers  which could affect our costs and production volumes 
for example  currently  our sole manufacturing facilities for electrode and microelectronics are located in san diego  california  an area known for natural wildfires and earthquakes 
however  we are in the process of opening a second manufacturing facility in peoria  arizona  which will provide for an alternative manufacturing location in the event we are impacted by a catastrophic event or other significant business interruption at one of our manufacturing locations 
war  terrorism  geopolitical uncertainties  public health issues  and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy  and thus could have a strong negative effect on us  our suppliers  logistics providers  manufacturing partners and customers 
our business operations are subject to interruption by power shortages  terrorist attacks and other hostile acts  labor disputes  public health issues  and other events beyond our control 
such events could decrease demand for our products  make it difficult or impossible for us to produce and deliver products to our customers  including channel partners  or to receive components from our suppliers  and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 
should major public health issues  including pandemics  arise  we could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions  additional limitations in freight services  governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions  delays in production ramps of new products  and disruptions in the operations of our manufacturing partners and component suppliers 
the majority of our research and development activities  our corporate headquarters  information technology systems  and other critical business operations  including certain component suppliers and manufacturing partners  are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters 
in the event of a natural disaster  losses could be incurred and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
while we may purchase insurance policies to cover the direct economic impact experienced following a natural disaster occurring at one of our own facilities  there can be no assurance that such insurance policies will cover the full extent of our financial loss nor will they cover losses which are not economic in nature such as  for example  our business and reputation as a reliable supplier 

table of contents we may be subject to information technology systems failures  network disruptions and breaches in data security 
information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders  impeding the manufacture or shipment of products  processing of transactions or reporting of financial results  or causing the unintentional disclosure of confidential information of our own or of our customers 
in the ordinary course of our business  we collect and store sensitive data  including intellectual property  our proprietary business information and that of our customers  suppliers and business partners  and personally identifiable information of our customers and certain employees  in our data centers and on our networks 
despite our security measures  our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error  malfeasance or other disruptions 
any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed  publicly disclosed  lost or stolen 
while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing certain data and system redundancy  hardening and fail over along with other network security and internal control measures  there can be no assurance that the measures we have implemented to date would be sufficient in the event of a system failure  loss of data or security breach 
as a result  in the event of such a failure  loss of data or security breach  our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
our ability to match our production plans for our ultracapacitor products to the level of product actually demanded by customers has a significant effect on our sales  costs and growth potential 
customers decisions are affected by market  economic and government regulation conditions which can be difficult to accurately gauge in advance 
in addition  many of the markets for our ultracapacitor products are within emerging industries and as such it is difficult to predict our future customer demands 
failure to provide customers and channel partners with demanded quantities of our products could reduce our sales 
conversely  increased capacity which exceeds actual customer demands for our products increases our costs and  consequently  reduces our profit margins on the products delivered 
although we have implemented policies and procedures for refining the forecasting methods used by customers and a more sophisticated mechanism for gauging the sales pipeline to better project timing of new customer demand  there can be no assurance that these mechanisms will match our production plans with customer demands 
additionally  we are continuing to develop new and improved products  which may require the implementation of new manufacturing processes and equipment lines 
as a result of all of these factors  we could fail to meet revenue or profit margin targets 
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  and if we fail to remediate these weaknesses and implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting  then our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and may lead investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial data 
implementing and maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements 
in evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december   management concluded that there were material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to our past revenue recognition practices for sales to certain distributors and one non distributor customer  as the criteria for revenue recognition were not met at the time of product sale when revenue was originally recorded for these sales 
as a result  we recognized revenue prematurely 
these errors resulted in the restatement of certain of our previously reported financial statements 
these control deficiencies could result in misstatements of revenue and accounts receivable balances and related disclosures that would result in material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 
accordingly  our management has determined that each of these control deficiencies constitutes a material weakness 
the specific material weaknesses are we did not maintain adequately designed controls to ensure accurate recognition of revenue in accordance with gaap 
specifically  controls were not effective to ensure that deviations from contractually established sales terms were authorized  communicated  identified and evaluated for their potential effect on revenue recognition  and we did not adequately train and supervise sales personnel to ensure that such personnel were appropriately conscious of the requirement to communicate deviations from contractually established sales terms to finance and accounting personnel in order for revenue recognition in our financial statements to be accurately recorded 
although our restated financial statements have been filed with the sec  we are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses identified above by  among other things  improving procedures to ensure the proper communication  approval and accounting review of deviations from sales contracts and providing periodic training and a formal revenue recognition policy to sales personnel and others involved in negotiating contractual sales terms in order to improve awareness and understanding of revenue recognition principles under us generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not know the timeframe needed to fully remediate the material weaknesses identified 
if we fail to remediate these material weaknesses or fail to otherwise maintain effective controls over financial reporting in the future  we might not be able to prevent or detect on a timely basis a 
table of contents material misstatement of our financial statements  which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial data 
our reputation could be damaged as a result of negative publicity 
we depend upon our reputation to compete for customers  suppliers  investors  strategic partners and personnel 
unfavorable publicity can damage our reputation and negatively impact our economic performance 
the restatement of our prior periods financial statements contained within this report  and the underlying business causes of such restatement  could damage our reputation 
further  the material weaknesses discovered in our internal controls which could lead to reduced confidence in our financial data or financial performance could also adversely impact our reputation  although we are making efforts to mitigate this risk by initiating remedial measures to correct the material weaknesses in our internal controls 
there can be no assurance that unfavorable publicity arising from the forgoing will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to meet our operating or other needs  which could require us to change our business strategy and result in decreased profitability and a loss of customers 
namely  as a result of our restatement of past financial statements  we are in violation of certain terms of our credit facility and  similarly  our shelf registration statement is ineffective  both of which impact our access to capital funding 
we believe that in the future we may need a substantial amount of additional capital for a number of potential purposes in furtherance of our strategic missions and growth objectives 
for example  to meet potential demand for our products  particularly for our ultracapacitor products  we will need to spend significant amounts of money on customized production equipment and cash generated by our operations may not be sufficient to cover these investments 
further  as stated above  additional capital may be required to execute on our strategies related to continued expansion into commercial markets  development of new products and technologies and acquisition of new or complementary businesses  product lines or technologies 
in december  we obtained a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of million the revolving line of credit and an equipment term loan the equipment term loan together  the credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  repayment of amounts owed pursuant to the credit facility accelerated in the event that the company is in violation of the representations  warranties and covenants made in connection with obtaining the credit facility 
these term and conditions include certain restrictions and financial covenants  including  specifically  requirements that we attain certain levels of financial performance 
as a result of the restatement of certain prior period financial statements within this annual report  beginning on december   we are in violation of the terms of the credit facility 
as such  the bank obligation to provide further credit under the credit facility has ceased and terminated and we are currently unable to borrow additional amounts under this facility to fund our operations or growth 
further  as a result of the violation of the terms of the credit facility  the bank could have exercised its right to immediately call the outstanding balance under this facility  which was million as of december  however  in june  we entered into a forbearance agreement with the bank the forbearance agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the forbearance agreement  the bank agreed to forbear from further exercise of its rights and remedies to call our outstanding debt obligation under the credit facility in connection with the event of default for a period terminating on the earlier of september   or the occurrence of any additional events of default 
this violation of the terms of our credit facility may affect our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms in the future 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statement contained in item of this annual report for additional information concerning the events of default under our credit facility 
in addition  in april  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to  from time to time  sell up to an aggregate of million of our common stock  warrants or debt securities 
in august  the registration statement was declared effective by the sec  which initially allowed us to access the capital markets for the three year period following this effective date  or through august to date  we have raised million pursuant to this shelf registration statement 
as a result of the restatement of certain prior period financial statements within this annual report  and because we have not filed amended annual and quarterly reports with the sec for the prior periods that were restated  we are no longer in compliance with the ongoing eligibility requirements of the shelf registration statement and the shelf registration statement is therefore no longer effective 
as such  no further common stock  warrants or debt securities may be issued pursuant to this registration statement 
consequently  we are unable to access the capital markets for additional funding through this mechanism until we complete the registration requirements in compliance with section of the securities act of  including filing a new registration statement  such as  for example  on form s  and having such registration statement declared effective 
in the future  there can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may be required to change or delay our planned growth  which could result in decreased revenues and profits and loss of customers 
also  if we are to raise additional funds by issuing equity  the issuance of 
table of contents additional shares will result in dilution to our current stockholders 
if additional financing is accomplished by the issuance of debt  the service cost  or interest  will reduce net income or increase net loss  and we may also be required to issue warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with issuing such debt 
unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved  and additional claims may arise in the future 
results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
regardless of merit  litigation may be both time consuming and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expense and diversion of management attention 
from time to time  we are involved in major lawsuits concerning intellectual property  torts  contracts  shareholder litigation  administrative proceedings and other matters  as well as governmental inquiries and investigations  the outcomes of which may be significant to our results of operations or limit our ability to engage in our business activities 
in recognition of these considerations  we may enter into material settlements to avoid ongoing costs and efforts in defending or pursuing a matter 
should we fail to prevail in certain matters  or should several of these matters be resolved against our favor in the same reporting period  we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
while we have insurance related to our business operations  it may not apply to or fully cover any liabilities we incur as a result of these lawsuits 
we have recorded reserves for potential liabilities where we believe the liability to be probable and reasonably estimable 
however  our actual costs may be materially different from this estimate 
for example  in the first and second quarters of  we were served with a series of complaints  as articulated in item legal proceedings  alleging that we issued materially false and misleading statements regarding our financial performance and business prospects and overstated our reported revenue thereby causing economic harm to shareholders who purchased stock during a particular time period 
this lawsuit could be  in addition to requiring the payment of an economic damages claim as well as other indemnification obligations  both time consuming and disruptive to the employees and affiliates involved in or supporting the defense of this action 
additionally  our reputation could be harmed as a result of the allegations asserted in public statements and court documents throughout the course of the action 
consequently  our financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely harmed 
the issuance of shares of our common stock could result in the loss of our ability to use our net operating losses 
as of december   we had approximately million of us federal tax and state tax net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of any benefit from our tax net operating losses is dependent on both our ability to generate future taxable income as well as the absence of certain ownership changes to our common stock 
an ownership change  as defined in the applicable federal income tax rules  would place significant limitations  on an annual basis  on the use of such net operating losses to offset any future taxable income we may generate 
the issuance of shares of our common stock  including the issuance of shares of common stock upon future conversion or exercise of outstanding stock options  could cause such an ownership change 
such limitations triggered by an ownership change  in conjunction with the net operating loss expiration provisions  could effectively eliminate our ability to use a substantial portion of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset any future taxable income 
our stock price continues to be volatile 
our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due to a number of factors  including but not limited to the various factors set forth in this risk factors section  as well as variations between our actual and anticipated financial results  announcements by us or our competitors  and uncertainty about current global economic conditions 
the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 
furthermore  we believe our stock price may reflect certain future growth and profitability expectations 
if we fail to meet these expectations then our stock price may significantly decline which could have an adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent certain transactions and could make a takeover more difficult 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we have a classified board of directors  which means that our directors are divided into three classes that are elected to three year terms on a staggered basis 
since the three year terms of each class overlap the terms of the other classes of directors  the entire board of directors cannot be replaced in any one year 
furthermore  our certificate of incorporation contains a fair price provision which may require a potential acquirer to obtain the consent of our board to any business combination involving us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions barring stockholder action by written consent unless first approved by a majority of the disinterested directors  and the calling by stockholders of a special meeting 
amendment of such provisions requires a super 
table of contents majority vote by the stockholders  except with the consent of the board of directors and a majority of the disinterested directors in certain circumstances 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay  deter or prevent a merger  tender offer  or other business combination or change in control involving us that stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 
this includes offers or attempted takeovers that could result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock

table of contents item legal proceedings fcpa matter as a result of being a publicly traded company in the us  we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
beginning in  we conducted an internal review into payments made to our former independent sales agent in china with respect to sales of our high voltage capacitor products produced by our swiss subsidiary 
in january  we reached settlements with the sec and the us department of justice doj with respect to charges asserted by the sec and doj relating to the anti bribery  books and records  internal controls  and disclosure provisions of the fcpa and other securities laws violations 
we settled civil charges with the sec  agreeing to an injunction against further violations of the fcpa 
under the terms of the settlement with the sec  we agreed to pay a total of approximately million in profit disgorgement and prejudgment interest  in two installments  with almost million paid in each of the first quarters of and under the terms of the settlement with the doj  we agreed to pay a total of million in penalties in three installments  with million paid in the first quarter of and million paid in each of the first quarters of and as part of the settlement  we entered into a three year deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the doj 
if we remain in compliance with the terms of the dpa  at the conclusion of the term  the charges against us asserted by the doj will be dismissed with prejudice 
further  under the terms of each agreement  we will periodically report to the sec and doj on our internal compliance program concerning anti bribery 
as of december   million was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and this final payment was paid in full as of january  customer bankruptcy matter in january  we attended a bankruptcy proceeding for a previous customer in order to bid on certain intellectual property and physical assets that were being auctioned 
during this proceeding  an offer for sale was presented for any and all potential claims held by the previous customer against us 
while the nature of these potential claims was not specified  the offer was construed as including potential claims related to payments made to us by the customer prior to the previous customer filing bankruptcy  as well as a potential intellectual property dispute between us and the previous customer 
at the january bankruptcy proceeding  we bid  to purchase from the bankruptcy estate the right to any and all claims against us stemming from rights held by the previous customer 
the bankruptcy estate later declined that offer and in the interest of a more expedient resolution  we had recently increased our settlement offer to  in december  the parties reached a final agreement for total consideration of  due from us to the bankruptcy estate for full and final release from any claims related only to the potential preference payment claim 
the settlement amount was paid in full in february concerning the potential intellectual property dispute  we believe this claim is meritless and that the chance of a significant loss with respect to this potential claim is remote 
as of the quarter ended september   we had accrued a liability of  for the anticipated settlement of these potential claims 
after consideration of the settlement of the preference claim matter in the amount of  the remaining balance of the accrual of  was reversed and credited to the statement of operations during the fourth quarter of securities matter in early  we voluntarily provided information to the united states attorney office for the southern district of california and the us securities and exchange commission related to our announcement that we intend to file restated financial statements for fiscal years and we are cooperating with these investigations 
at this preliminary stage  we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this action  nor can we estimate the range of potential loss  and we therefore have not accrued an amount for any potential costs associated with this action  but an adverse result could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation
