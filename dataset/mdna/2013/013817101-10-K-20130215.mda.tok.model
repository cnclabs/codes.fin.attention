overview our business alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum  fabricated aluminum  and alumina combined  through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry technology  mining  refining  smelting  fabricating  and recycling 
aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily 
aluminum and alumina represent more than of alcoa s revenues  and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa 
nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners 
alcoa s products are used worldwide in aircraft  automobiles  commercial transportation  packaging  building and construction  oil and gas  defense  consumer electronics  and industrial applications 

table of contents alcoa is a global company operating in countries 
based upon the country where the point of sale occurred  the us and europe generated and  respectively  of alcoa s sales in in addition  alcoa has investments and operating activities in  among others  australia  brazil  china  guinea  iceland  russia  and saudi arabia  all of which present opportunities for substantial growth 
governmental policies  laws and regulations  and other economic factors  including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  affect the results of operations in these countries 
management review of and outlook for the future at the end of  management had projected growth in global aluminum demand of for in the first half of the year  demand was on course  however  a slowdown in growth in china in the second half resulted in an actual growth rate of 
additionally  lme pricing levels declined on average year over year  mainly due to macroeconomic events  including significant uncertainty of the sovereign debt of many european countries and the us fiscal cliff 
the company also faced significant headwinds for certain costs  including maintenance supplies and services  labor  especially in emerging markets  transportation costs  mostly fuel oil  and higher pension costs 
consequently  the operating results of the company s upstream businesses declined compared with partially offsetting this decrease was the company s midstream and downstream businesses achieving their highest profitability ever driven by net productivity improvements and higher volumes 
management continued its relentless focus on liquidity and cash flows generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies  overhead rationalization  working capital  and disciplined capital spending 
these actions enabled alcoa to decrease debt while maintaining a stable level of cash on hand 
the following financial information reflects some key measures of alcoa s results sales of  and income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share  total segment after tax operating income of  cash from operations of  reduced by pension contributions of capital expenditures of  under  for the third consecutive year  cash on hand at the end of the year of  in excess of  for the fourth consecutive year  decrease in total debt of  and a decline of  since  and debt to capital ratio of  a decrease of basis points from and within the targeted range of to 
in  management is projecting continued growth increase of in the global consumption of primary aluminum  consistent with that of all regions  except north america  are expected to have one to three percentage point increases in aluminum demand over with china and india expected to have the highest growth rates in however  added production  along with few industry wide capacity curtailments  will result in supply slightly exceeding demand for primary aluminum 
for alumina  growth in global consumption is estimated to be  and overall demand is expected to slightly exceed supply 
management also anticipates improved market conditions for aluminum products in all major global end markets  particularly aerospace  despite declines in certain regions 
relative to input costs  labor and maintenance expenses will continue to be a challenge  however  management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in generating incremental savings over those realized in through from procurement  overhead  and working capital programs  generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending  and maintaining a debt to capital ratio between and 
looking ahead over the next one to three years  management will continue to focus on its aggressive strategic targets established two years ago 
these targets include lowering alcoa s refining and smelting operations on the cost curve to the rd from th and st from st percentiles  respectively  by and driving revenue growth in the 
table of contents midstream increase of  and downstream increase of  operations by in conjunction with the revenue targets  management is committed to improving margins that will exceed historical levels in the midstream and downstream operations 
management has made significant progress on these targets as described below 
in  actions taken to improve alcoa s position on the cost curve for both refining and smelting operations included production curtailments of kmt of the atlantic refinery system  the creep of low cost capacity at the refineries in australia  full or partial curtailment of kmt of smelting capacity in europe and the permanent closure of kmt of smelting capacity in the us  the near full startup of the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil  and new energy contracts for two us smelters 
additionally  the aluminum complex in saudi arabia continues to be on target as first production from the smelter occurred in december and the mine and refinery are expected to commence in at december   alcoa s refining operations were in the th percentile and smelting operations were in the th percentile  a four percentage point improvement  on the respective cost curves 
the midstream and downstream operations both achieved margins that exceeded historical levels for the second year in a row and are making progress against the respective revenue growth targets 
the midstream operations will continue to build on this success in through expansion of the rolling facilities in davenport  ia to meet rising us automotive demand  due to changing emissions regulations  and volume growth in russia and china  including emerging markets like consumer electronics 
the downstream operations will extend their profitable growth in through continued innovative solutions to meet a wide range of customer needs  as well as expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in lafayette  in to meet the growing demand in the aerospace market and the opening of a forged wheels facility in suzhou  china that will serve the commercial transportation market 
results of operations earnings summary income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for was  or per diluted share  compared with  or per share  in the decline of in continuing operations was primarily due to the following lower realized prices for aluminum and alumina  higher input costs  and charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters 
these items were partially offset by net productivity improvements  a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets  a decline in the results attributable to noncontrolling interests  lower restructuring charges  net favorable foreign currency movements  lower income taxes due to a decline in operating results  a favorable lifo last in  first out impact  and higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments 
income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for was  or per share  compared with  or per share  in the improvement of in continuing operations was primarily due to the following higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum  stronger volumes in the midstream and downstream segments  net productivity improvements  and a net favorable change in mark to market derivative contracts 
these items were partially offset by higher input costs  net unfavorable foreign currency movements  higher income taxes due to better operating results  and additional restructuring charges 
net income attributable to alcoa for was  or per share  compared with  or per share  in  and  or per share  in in  net income of included a loss from discontinued operations of  and  in  net income of included a loss from discontinued operations of in  alcoa restarted the following previously curtailed production capacity in the us massena east  ny kmt per year  wenatchee  wa kmt per year  and ferndale  wa intalco kmt per year kmt more than previously planned 
these restarts occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers 
as a result of these restarts  aluminum production increased by approximately kmt during and by kmt in 
table of contents in late  management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the smelter located in tennessee kmt per year and two potlines capacity of kmt per year at the smelter located in rockdale  tx remaining capacity of kmt per year composed of four potlines 
this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included  among others lack of an economically viable  long term power solution  changed market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  required future capital investment  and restart costs 
also  at the end of  management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme  italy kmt per year  avil s  spain kmt out of kmt per year  and la coru a  spain kmt out of kmt per year 
these curtailments were completed by the end of the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility  while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary 
these actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions  combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid to late 
in december  the spanish government issued a ministerial order that modified the interruptibility regime previously in place in the spanish power market 
the interruptibility regime allows certain industrial customers who are willing to be subject to temporary interruptions in the supply of power to sell interruption rights to the high voltage transmission system operator 
in january  alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell interruption services under the modified regime from its san ciprian  avil s  and la coru a smelters in spain 
the commitment is taken for a one year period 
alcoa understands that the spanish government intends to notify the european commission of the modification in the interruptibility regime for review under european state aid rules 
as a result of the modification to the interruptibility regime  alcoa has commenced the restart of a portion kmt combined for avil s and la coru a of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime 
sales sales for were  compared with sales of  in  a decrease of  or 
the decline was mainly the result of a drop in realized prices for aluminum and alumina  driven by lower london metal exchange lme prices  unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices  and unfavorable foreign currency movements  mostly due to a weaker euro  somewhat offset by higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments and favorable product mix in the midstream segment 
sales for were  compared with sales of  in  an improvement of  or 
the increase was primarily due to a rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  better pricing in the midstream segment  and higher volumes in the primary metals segment and virtually all businesses in the midstream and downstream segments 
cost of goods sold cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the percentage was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower realized prices in the upstream and midstream segments  higher input costs  a net charge for adjustments to certain environmental reserves  and a charge for a civil litigation reserve 
these items were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements  net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar  and a change in lifo adjustments from unfavorable to favorable  primarily due to lower prices for alumina and metal and lower costs for calcined coke 
cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the percentage was negatively impacted by higher energy and raw materials costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  mostly offset by the previously mentioned higher realized prices and net productivity improvements 
selling  general administrative  and other expenses sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in the decline of was mostly due to lower stock based compensation expense  a decrease in bad debt expense see below  a decline in travel expense  and less spending across various other expenses 
these items were partially offset by higher pension costs  due to the recognition of higher net actuarial losses  and increased professional expenses  due to consulting fees associated with productivity initiatives and higher legal expenses 

table of contents sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in the increase of was principally the result of higher labor costs and an increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in labor costs was the result of a higher average employee base and a higher cost of employee benefits 
the higher bad debt expense was caused by charges for anticipated customer credit losses  primarily related to those in europe 
research and development expenses r d expenses were in compared with in and in the increase in as compared to was primarily caused by additional spending related to inert anode technology for the primary metals segment 
the increase in as compared to was mainly driven by incremental increases across various expenses necessary to support r d activities 
provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the decrease of  or  was principally the result of the cessation of dd a due to the decision at the end of to permanently shut down and demolish the smelter in tennessee see restructuring and other charges below and the absence of dd a on various in use assets that reached the end of their estimated useful life in  partially offset by an increase related to assets placed into service associated with a new hydroelectric power facility in brazil and higher dd a due to the capitalization of new haul roads and the write off of old haul roads no longer in use for mining sites in australia 
the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the increase of  or  was mostly due to a portion of the assets placed into service in mid related to a new hydroelectric power facility in brazil  along with a number of small increases at various locations 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges for each year in the three year period ended december  were comprised of the following asset impairments layoff costs other exit costs reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs restructuring and other charges layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated  benefits to be paid under existing severance plans  union contracts or statutory requirements  and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 
actions in  alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which were comprised of the following components after tax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately employees in the engineered products and solutions segment  in the primary metals segment  in the alumina segment  and in corporate  including after tax for the layoff of an additional employees related to the previously reported smelter curtailments in spain see actions below  after tax in asset impairments and after tax for lease and contract termination costs due to a decision to exit the lithographic sheet business in bohai  china  after tax in costs to idle the portovesme smelter see actions below  after tax in other asset impairments  a net charge of after tax and noncontrolling interests for other miscellaneous items  and after tax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods  including after tax related to the smelters in spain 
the reversal related to the smelters in spain is due to lower than expected costs based on agreements with employee representatives and the government  as well as a reduction of in the number of layoffs due to the anticipation of the restart of a portion of the previously curtailed capacity based on an agreement with the spanish government that will provide interruptibility rights ie compensation for power interruptions when grids are overloaded to the smelters during a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded at the end of see actions below and a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded during see above 

table of contents as of december   approximately of the employees were separated 
the remaining separations for the restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of in  cash payments of were made against layoff reserves related to the restructuring programs 
actions in  alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which were comprised of the following components after tax in asset impairments and after tax in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at two us locations see below  after tax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately  employees in the primary metals segment  in the global rolled products segment  in the alumina segment  in the engineered products and solutions segment  and in corporate  including the effects of planned smelter curtailments see below  after tax and noncontrolling interests for other asset impairments  including the write off of the carrying value of an idled structure in australia that processed spent pot lining and adjustments to the fair value of the one remaining foil location while it was classified as held for sale due to foreign currency movements  after tax and noncontrolling interests for a litigation matter related to the former st 
croix location  a net charge of after tax for other small items  and after tax for the reversal of previously recorded layoff reserves due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances  including a change in plans for alcoa s aluminum powder facility in rockdale  tx 
in late  management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two us locations  each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons 
the identified facilities are the smelter located in alcoa  tn capacity of kmt per year and two potlines capacity of kmt per year at the smelter located in rockdale  tx remaining capacity of kmt per year composed of four potlines 
demolition and remediation activities related to these actions began in and are expected to be completed in for the tennessee smelter and in for the two potlines at the rockdale smelter 
this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included  among others lack of an economically viable  long term power solution  changed market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  required future capital investment  and restart costs 
the asset impairments of represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties  plants  and equipment related to these facilities 
additionally  remaining inventories  mostly operating supplies  were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of after tax  which was recorded in cost of goods sold on the accompanying statement of consolidated operations 
the other exit costs of represent after tax in environmental remediation and after tax in asset retirement obligations  both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures  and after tax in other related costs 
also  at the end of  management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme  italy kmt per year  avil s  spain kmt out of kmt per year  and la coru a  spain kmt out of kmt per year 
these curtailments were completed by the end of the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility  which would result in future charges  while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary 
these actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions  combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid to late 
as a result of these decisions  alcoa recorded costs of after tax for the layoff of approximately employees 
as alcoa engaged in discussions with the respective employee representatives and governments  additional charges were recognized in see actions above 
as of december   approximately of the  employees were separated 
the total number of employees associated with the restructuring programs was updated to reflect changes in plans agreement related to the smelters in spain see actions above  better than expected operating performance at certain locations  and natural attrition 
the remaining separations for the restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of in and  cash payments of and  respectively  were made against layoff reserves related to the restructuring programs 
actions in  alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which were comprised of the following components after tax and noncontrolling interests in 
table of contents asset impairments and after tax and noncontrolling interests in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at five us locations see below  after tax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately employees in the engineered products and solutions segment  in the primary metals segment  in the alumina segment  in the global rolled products segment  and in corporate  after tax in net charges including after tax for asset impairments related to divested and to be divested businesses automotive castings  global foil  transportation products europe  and packaging and consumer for  among other items  the settlement of a contract with a former customer  foreign currency movements  working capital adjustments  and a tax indemnification  after tax and noncontrolling interests for various other exit costs  and after tax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of prior periods layoff reserves  including a portion of those related to the portovesme smelter in italy due to the execution of a new power agreement 
in early  management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the following structures  each of which was previously temporarily idled for different reasons the eastalco smelter located in frederick  md capacity of kmt per year  the smelter located in badin  nc capacity of kmt per year  an aluminum fluoride plant in point comfort  tx  a paste plant and cast house in massena  ny  and one potline at the smelter in warrick  in capacity of kmt per year 
this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  other existing idle capacity  required future capital investment  and restart costs  as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs 
the asset impairments of represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties  plants  and equipment related to these facilities 
additionally  remaining inventories  mostly operating supplies  were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of after tax and noncontrolling interests  which was recorded in cost of goods sold on the accompanying statement of consolidated operations 
the other exit costs of represent after tax and noncontrolling interests in asset retirement obligations and after tax in environmental remediation  both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures  and after tax and noncontrolling interests in other related costs 
as of december   the separations associated with restructuring programs were essentially complete 
in and  cash payments of and  respectively  were made against layoff reserves related to restructuring programs 
alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments 
the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows alumina primary metals global rolled products engineered products and solutions segment total corporate total restructuring and other charges interest expense interest expense was in compared with in the decline of  or  was principally caused by the absence of a net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes see below  somewhat offset by lower capitalized interest 
the decrease in capitalized interest was largely attributable to the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil as construction nears completion  partially offset by an increase related to the aluminum complex in saudi arabia 
interest expense was in compared with in the increase of  or  was primarily due to a net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a gain for in the money interest rate swaps  somewhat offset by the absence of a net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a gain for in the money interest rate swaps 

table of contents other income expenses  net other income  net was in compared with in the increase of was mostly due to a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets see primary metals in segment information below and net favorable foreign currency movements 
these two items were somewhat offset by lower equity income  largely attributable to alcoa s share of expenses of the joint venture in saudi arabia and the absence of a discrete income tax benefit recognized by the consortium related to an investment in a natural gas pipeline in australia see below  the absence of a gain on the sale of land see below  and a net unfavorable change in mark to market derivative contracts  principally driven by the absence of a favorable change in an energy contract that expired in september other income  net was in compared with other expenses  net of in the change of was mainly the result of a net favorable change of in mark to market derivative contracts  a gain of from the sale of land in australia  and higher equity income from an investment in a natural gas pipeline in australia due to the recognition of a discrete income tax benefit by the consortium alcoa world alumina and chemicals share of the benefit was  slightly offset by a decrease in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance 
income taxes alcoa s effective tax rate was in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax impact from the gain recognized on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets see primary metals in segment information below and an discrete income tax charge related to prior year us taxes on certain depletable assets  slightly offset by a discrete income tax benefit related to a change in the legal structure of an investment 
alcoa s effective tax rate was in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate mainly due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions 
alcoa s effective tax rate was in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions  a discrete income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance as a result of previously restricted net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary now available  a discrete income tax benefit related to a canadian provincial tax law change permitting a tax return to be filed in us dollars  and a net discrete income tax benefit for various other items  partially offset by a discrete income tax charge as a result of a change in the tax treatment of federal subsidies received related to prescription drug benefits provided under certain retiree health care benefit plans that were determined to be actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and a discrete income tax charge based on settlement discussions of several matters with international taxing authorities this amount represents a decrease to alcoa s unrecognized tax benefits 
management anticipates that the effective tax rate in will be approximately 
however  changes in the current economic environment  tax legislation or rate changes  currency fluctuations  ability to realize deferred tax assets  and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 
on january   the american taxpayer relief act of was signed into law and extended through various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions 
two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in and impacted alcoa are the look through rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit 
the expiration of these two provisions resulted in alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of in as tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment  alcoa will recognize an discrete income tax benefit in related to the tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions 
in december  one of the company s subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations 
if approved  the tax rate for this subsidiary will decrease significantly  resulting in future cash tax savings over the year holiday period would be effective as of january  
additionally  the net deferred tax asset of the subsidiary would be remeasured at the lower rate in the period the holiday is approved 
this remeasurement would result in a decrease to the net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of approximately to as of december   alcoa s subsidiary s application is still pending 

table of contents noncontrolling interests net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was in compared with net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of in the change of was mostly due to lower earnings at alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac  which is owned by alcoa and by alumina limited 
the decline in earnings at awac were attributed primarily to lower realized prices  due to a decrease in contractual lme based pricing  higher input costs  particularly caustic and fuel oil  and a charge for a litigation reserve of these items were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was in compared with in the increase of was largely the result of higher earnings at awac 
the improved earnings at awac were mainly driven by higher realized prices  partially offset by higher input costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 
loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of an additional loss of pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion divested in june of the electrical and electronic solutions ees business as a result of a negotiated preliminary settlement related to claims filed in against alcoa by platinum equity in an insolvency proceeding in germany  a net gain of pretax related to both the wire harness and electrical portion and the electronics portion divested in december of the ees business for a number of small post closing and other adjustments  and a pretax reversal of the gain recognized in related to the sale of the home exteriors business for an adjustment to an outstanding obligation  which was part of the terms of sale 
loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of an additional loss of pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business as a result of a contract settlement with a former customer of this business and an additional loss of pretax related to the electronics portion of the ees business for the settling of working capital  which was not included in the divestiture transaction 
segment information alcoa s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina  primary metals  global rolled products  and engineered products and solutions 
segment performance under alcoa s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors  however  the primary measure of performance is the after tax operating income atoi of each segment 
certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting  interest expense  noncontrolling interests  corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities  along with depreciation and amortization on corporate owned assets  restructuring and other charges  discontinued operations  and other items  including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments  differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate  the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil  and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains losses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 
atoi for all reportable segments totaled  in   in  and  in see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k for additional information 
the following discussion provides shipments  sales  and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december  alumina alumina production kmt third party alumina shipments kmt third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi 
table of contents this segment represents a portion of alcoa s upstream operations and consists of the company s worldwide refinery system  including the mining of bauxite  which is then refined into alumina 
alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products 
a portion of this segment s third party sales are completed through the use of agents  alumina traders  and distributors 
slightly more than half of alcoa s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide  while the remainder is used internally by the primary metals segment 
in  alumina production decreased by kmt compared to the decline was mainly driven by lower production in the atlantic refinery system as a result of management s plan to reduce annual production capacity by approximately kmt 
this decision was made to align production with smelter curtailments initiated at the beginning of and to reflect prevailing market conditions 
the decrease at these three refineries was partially offset by higher production at the pinjarra and kwinana refineries in australia  due to system process improvements 
in  alumina production increased by kmt compared to the improvement was mostly the result of higher production at the s o lu s brazil refinery  as the ramp up of the  kmt expanded capacity the alumina segment s share is approximately  kmt per year that began in late continued through third party sales for the alumina segment dropped in compared with  primarily related to a decline in realized prices  driven by a decrease in contractual lme based pricing  slightly offset by realized benefits from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and from improved spot pricing 
third party sales for this segment improved in compared with  largely attributable to a increase in realized prices  driven by the movement of customer contracts to alumina index pricing  benefits from improved spot prices  and improved pricing from lme based contracts 
intersegment sales for the alumina segment decreased in compared with  principally due to lower realized prices and decreased demand from the primary metals segment 
intersegment sales for this segment climbed in compared with  primarily the result of higher realized prices and an increase in demand from the primary metals segment 
atoi for the alumina segment dropped in compared with  mostly due to the previously mentioned lower realized prices  higher input costs  particularly caustic and fuel oil  and the absence of a gain on the sale of land in australia  somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar  especially against the brazilian real 
atoi for this segment increased in compared with  mainly caused by the significant improvement in realized prices and a gain on the sale of land in australia  partially offset by considerably higher input costs  particularly related to caustic and fuel oil  and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  especially against the australian dollar 
in  the continued shift towards alumina index or spot pricing is expected to average of third party sales  while those still contractually linked to the lme will follow a day lag 
additionally  net productivity improvements are expected to continue 
primary metals aluminum production kmt third party aluminum shipments kmt alcoa s average realized price per metric ton of aluminum third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi 
table of contents this segment represents a portion of alcoa s upstream operations and consists of the company s worldwide smelter system 
primary metals receives alumina  mostly from the alumina segment  and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa s fabricating businesses  as well as sold to external customers  aluminum traders  and commodity markets 
results from the sale of aluminum powder  scrap  and excess power are also included in this segment  as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buy resell activity 
primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices 
the sale of primary aluminum represents more than of this segment s third party sales 
buy resell activity refers to when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements 
in november  alcoa completed the sale of its megawatt tapoco hydroelectric project tapoco to brookfield renewable energy partners for in cash 
alcoa recognized a gain of after tax in other income  net on the accompanying statement of consolidated operations  of which a gain of after tax was reflected in the primary metals segment and a loss of after tax was reflected in corporate 
the amount in corporate represents the write off of goodwill and capitalized interest related to tapoco that were not included in the assets of the primary metals segment 
tapoco is a four station hydroelectric project located on the little tennessee and cheoah rivers in eastern tennessee and western north carolina 
the transaction included four generating stations and dams  miles of transmission lines  and approximately  acres of land associated with and surrounding tapoco 
the power generated by tapoco was primarily consumed by alcoa s smelter in tennessee  which was temporarily idled in and permanently shut down in since  the power generated from tapoco was sold into the open market 
at december   alcoa had kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of  kmt 
in  idle capacity decreased kmt compared to due to the permanent shutdown of the smelter in tennessee kmt per year and two potlines at the smelter located in rockdale  tx kmt per year  mostly offset by the curtailment of the portovesme smelter in italy kmt per year and the temporarily curtailment of a portion of the smelters in spain avil s kmt out of kmt per year and la coru a kmt out of kmt per year 
additionally  base capacity declined kmt between december  and due to the previously mentioned permanent shutdowns 
in late  management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the tennessee smelter and two potlines at the rockdale smelter remaining capacity of kmt per year composed of four potlines  each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons 
this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included  among others lack of an economically viable  long term power solution  changed market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  required future capital investment  and restart costs 
also  at the end of  management approved a full curtailment of the portovesme smelter and a partial curtailment at the avil s and la coru a smelters 
the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility  while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary 
these actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions  combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid to late

the sale of such receivables is completed through the use of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity  which is a consolidated subsidiary of alcoa 
this arrangement provides for minimum funding of up to a maximum of for receivables sold 
alcoa initially sold of customer receivables in exchange for in cash and of deferred purchase price under this arrangement 
alcoa received additional cash funding of throughout as of december   the deferred purchase price receivable was  which was included in other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred purchase price receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur  however  as this is a revolving program  the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable 
the net change in the deferred purchase price receivable was reflected in the decrease in receivables line item on the statement of consolidated cash flows 
this activity is reflected as an operating cash flow because the related customer receivables are the result of an operating activity with an insignificant  short term interest rate risk 
in  the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase price receivable were  and  respectively 
the gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collections under this program since its inception was  and  respectively 
alcoa services the customer receivables for the financial institution at market rates  therefore  no servicing asset or liability was recorded 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include accounting for 
table of contents derivatives and hedging activities  environmental and litigation matters  asset retirement obligations  the testing of goodwill  equity investments  and properties  plants  and equipment for impairment  estimating fair value of businesses to be divested  pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
derivatives and hedging 
derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period 
if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur  future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense 
alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges 
as a result  the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense  consistent with the underlying hedged item 
alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales  cost of goods sold  or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures  generally not exceeding five years 
if no hedging relationship is designated  the derivative is marked to market through earnings 
cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 
environmental matters 
expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations  which will not contribute to future revenues  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the liability may include costs such as site investigations  consultant fees  feasibility studies  outside contractors  and monitoring expenses 
estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery 
claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties 
the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share 
the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress  prospective estimates of required activity  and other factors that may be relevant  including changes in technology or regulations 

table of contents litigation matters 
for asserted claims and assessments  liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable 
management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter  available defenses and case strategy  progress of the matter  views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors  applicability and success of appeals processes  and the outcome of similar historical matters  among others 
once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable  management weighs the probability of estimated losses  and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded 
if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible  then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded 
with respect to unasserted claims or assessments  management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely  then  a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made 
legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 
asset retirement obligations 
alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa s bauxite mining  alumina refining  and aluminum smelting facilities 
these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal  closure of bauxite residue areas  mine reclamation  and landfill closure 
alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation  if required by a lease agreement  and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities 
the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis  at the time the obligation is incurred  and accreted over time for the change in present value 
additionally  alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 
certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries  aluminum smelters  and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date 
a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa s control 
such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures  maintenance and upgrade programs  and other factors 
at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made  alcoa would record an aro for the removal  treatment  transportation  storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos  underground and aboveground storage tanks  polychlorinated biphenyls  various process residuals  solid wastes  electronic equipment waste  and various other materials 
such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded 
if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately  the estimated caro as of december  ranges from less than to per structure structures in today s dollars 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions  negative developments in equity and credit markets  adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates  increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows  or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods  among others 
the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
alcoa has nine reporting units  of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment 
the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment  the primary metals segment  the global rolled products segment  and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil  which is included in corporate 
almost of alcoa s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs  and alcoa power and propulsion app  businesses  both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment  and primary metals 
these amounts include an allocation of corporate s goodwill 

table of contents in september  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance for testing goodwill for impairment see the recently adopted accounting guidance section of note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k 
the guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test described below  otherwise no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  proceed directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
in the fourth quarter  in conjunction with management s annual review of goodwill  alcoa early adopted the new guidance 
as a result  alcoa instituted a policy for its annual review of goodwill to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
management will proceed directly to the two step quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units based on facts and circumstances during each annual review of goodwill 
this policy will result in each of the nine reporting units being subjected to the two step quantitative impairment test at least once during every three year period 
under the qualitative assessment  various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above 
these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive  neutral  and adverse categories based on current business conditions 
additionally  an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high  medium  and low weighting 
furthermore  management considers the results of the most recent two step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit this would be and in which the estimated fair values of three and nine reporting units  respectively  were substantially in excess of their carrying values and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 
during the annual review of goodwill  management performed the qualitative assessment for six reporting units 
management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the six reporting units were less than their carrying values 
as such  no further analysis was required 
under the two step quantitative impairment test  the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
alcoa uses a dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment  as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units 
cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years 
the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 
in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value  additional analysis would be required 
the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill  which may involve the use of valuation experts 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized  which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity 

table of contents during the annual review of goodwill  management proceeded directly to the two step quantitative impairment test for three reporting units as follows the primary metals segment  the alumina segment  and the global rolled products segment 
for global rolled products  the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value by more than  resulting in no impairment 
for primary metals and alumina  the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively  resulting in no impairment 
these two reporting units have goodwill of  and  respectively 
in developing the fair value of these reporting units  the company estimates future cash flows using lme forward curve pricing and operating cost assumptions management believes are reasonable based on expected and historical performance 
the following could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of primary metals and alumina a significant  protracted decrease in lme and alumina prices  decrease in long term profitability  decrease in the long term demand for aluminum  substantial reductions in alcoa s end markets and volume assumptions  and an increase in discount rates 
as part of the annual review of goodwill  management considered the market capitalization of alcoa s common stock in relation to the company s total shareholders equity 
at december   the market capitalization of alcoa s common stock was  while this amount is less than the company s total shareholders equity at december   the estimated aggregate fair value of alcoa s reporting units was substantially in excess of the aforementioned market capitalization amount 
in management s judgment  the main reason for the difference between alcoa s market capitalization and total shareholders equity at december  is significantly lower commodity prices for aluminum 
management believes these commodity prices are being adversely impacted by turmoil in the macroeconomic environment  which do not necessarily reflect aluminum industry fundamentals 
for example  there was  and continues to be  significant uncertainty of the sovereign debt of many european countries 
this uncertainty has affected the liquidity of many companies that either operate or are located in europe  although  alcoa has not been impacted significantly 
additionally  during  there was great concern over what was labeled the fiscal cliff in the us and a slowdown in the growth of china 
the combination of this economic uncertainty and the continuing decline in commodity prices caused the price of alcoa s common stock to remain depressed 
as a result  management believes the quoted market price of alcoa s common stock does not fully reflect the underlying value of the future aggregate cash flows of the company s reporting units 
accordingly  management does not believe that the comparison of alcoa s market capitalization and total shareholders equity as of december  is an indication that goodwill is impaired 
equity investments 
alcoa invests in a number of privately held companies  primarily through joint ventures and consortia  which are accounted for on the equity method 
the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee 
management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable 
this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired 
the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant  sustained declines in an investee s revenue  earnings  and cash flow trends  adverse market conditions of the investee s industry or geographic area  the investee s ability to continue operations measured by several items  including liquidity  and other factors 
once an impairment indicator is identified  management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value 
an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 
properties  plants  and equipment 
properties  plants  and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value  with fair value determined using the best information available  which generally is a dcf model 
the determination of what constitutes an asset group  the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows  and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

table of contents discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model  valuations performed by third parties  earnings multiples  or indicative bids  when available 
a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques  including the forecasting of markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs and expenses  and multiple other factors 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made  however  the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  health care cost trend rates  retirement age  and mortality 
the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a company specific yield curve model above median developed with the assistance of an external actuary 
the cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds  which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors  including finance and banking  manufacturing  transportation  insurance  and pharmaceutical  among others 
the yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows  which have an average duration of years  and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company s plans obligations multiple times 
in   and  the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was   and  respectively 
the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of of would be approximately and either a charge or credit of to after tax earnings in the following year 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five year market related value of plan assets a four year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non us plans 
the process used by management to develop this assumption has expanded from one that relied primarily on historical asset return information to one that also incorporates forward looking returns by asset class  as described below 
prior to developing the expected long term rate of return for calendar year  management focused on historical actual returns annual  year moving  and year moving averages when developing this assumption 
based on that process  management utilized for the expected long term rate of return for several years through for calendar year  the expected long term rate of return was reduced to due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the then global economic downturn 
this was supported by the fact that  in  the year moving average of actual performance fell below for the first time in years  although the year moving average continued to exceed 
for calendar year  management expanded its process by incorporating expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and management s own judgment 
management considered this forward looking analysis as well as the historical return information  and concluded the expected rate of return for calendar would remain at  which was between the year moving average actual return performance and the estimated future return developed by asset class 
for calendar year and  management again incorporated both actual historical return information and expected future returns into its analysis 
based on strategic asset allocation changes and estimates of future returns by asset class  management used as its expected long term rate of return for both years 
this rate again falls within the range of the year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class 
for calendar year  management used the same methodology as it did for and and determined that will be the expected long term rate of return 
a change in the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of of would impact after tax earnings by approximately for

in  a net charge of after tax was recorded in other comprehensive income  primarily due to a basis point decrease in the discount rate  which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
additionally  in  a charge of was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 
stock based compensation 
alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non substantive vesting period approach  in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility  annual forfeiture rate  and exercise behavior 
these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 
equity grants are issued in january each year 
as part of alcoa s stock based compensation plan design  individuals who are retirement eligible have a six month requisite service period in the year of grant 
as a result  a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement eligible employees 
compensation expense recorded in   and was after tax  after tax  and after tax  respectively 
of this amount    and in   and  respectively  pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement eligible employees 
most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options  stock awards  or a combination of both 
this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all potential sources of taxable income  including income available in carryback periods  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  projections of taxable income  and income from tax planning strategies  as well as all available positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations  projections of future profitability within the carryforward period  including from tax planning strategies  and the company s experience with similar operations 
existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence 
negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses  projections of future losses  or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income 
deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances  resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance 
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold 
otherwise  these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled  which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 
interest and penalties related to
