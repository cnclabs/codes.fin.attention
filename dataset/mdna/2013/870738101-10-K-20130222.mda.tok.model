item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended december   and included with this report 
unless otherwise noted  both historical information for all periods and forward looking information provided in this management discussion and analysis relates solely to our continuing operations located in the united states  and excludes our new zealand operations discontinued since late the following information contains forward looking statements  see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company formed in and we are engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and operation of oil and natural gas properties  with a focus on our reserves and production from our texas properties as well as onshore and inland waters of louisiana 
we are one of the largest producers of crude oil in the state of louisiana  and hold a large acreage position in texas prospective for eagle ford shale and olmos tight sands development 
oil production accounted for of our production and of our oil and gas sales  and combined production of both oil and natural gas liquids ngls constituted of our production and of our oil and gas sales 
this has allowed us to benefit from better margins for oil production  as oil prices are significantly higher on a boe basis than natural gas prices 
activities production our production volumes increased by in when compared to volumes in as ngl volumes increased by and natural gas production volumes increased by  while oil volumes decreased by 
the increase in ngl and natural gas production came from our south texas area 
although the percentage of our total production volumes from crude oil sales has steadily decreased over the last three years  crude oil sales as a percentage of our total oil and gas sales have remained relatively stable 
increased reserves our year end total proved reserves increased over our year end reserves by to a company record of mmboe  while our oil and ngls as a percentage of total reserves increased to in from in this increase was mainly due to large increases in oil and ngl reserves in our south texas area 
pricing our weighted average sales price in decreased when compared to levels in as natural gas prices declined  ngl prices declined and oil prices declined 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by million or  when compared to  due to the decline in prices received during the period 
revenues and earnings our oil and gas sales of million declined in when compared to levels in  due to the decrease in natural gas and ngl prices discussed above 
when combined with an increase in total costs and expenses of million or  and million of income from discontinued operations recognized in  our net income fell to million 
debt issuance and available liquidity in october  we issued million of senior notes due at a premium of million which equates to an effective yield of 
these notes were an add on to the original million of senior notes due that were issued in november we also extended our credit facility through and increased the borrowing base and commitment amount to million 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures on a cash flow basis were million in compared to million spent in the increase of million was mainly due to additional drilling and completion activity during in our south texas core region as we drilled wells in our artesia wells eagle ford field  wells in our awp eagle ford field  nine wells in our awp olmos field and two wells in our fasken eagle ford field  which helped us evaluate eagle ford and olmos acreage positions in those areas 
we also drilled wells in our southeast louisiana area and five wells in our central louisiana east texas area  including four non operated wells 
these expenditures were primarily funded by million of cash provided by operating activities  the remaining cash proceeds from our and note issuances and our credit facility 
operating efficiencies our south texas drilling activities have benefited from optimized well design  improved operational efficiencies  and applied lessons learned from our experience in this area  all of which have resulted in a reduction of drilling days per well 
consequently  we are currently able to drill more wells per rig than previously expected 
we have also experienced efficiency gains in our hydraulic fracturing activities which enables us to perform more frac stages per month and lower the overall frac cost per stage 

table of contents strategy and outlook focus on oil and liquids properties with expanded capital budget our inventory of drilling locations allows us to be flexible in scheduling upcoming wells in south texas to focus on oil and natural gas liquids 
having fulfilled our near term obligations on most of our acreage prospective for dry natural gas production  we are concentrating on our higher return  liquids rich acreage almost exclusively in our capital expenditures are currently estimated to be to million focused on continued development of oil and liquid rich properties 
we plan to fund these expenditures through operating cash flow  availability under our credit facility and potential non core property dispositions 
increase reserves with stable production for  the company is targeting production up to over levels and proved reserves to increase to  over year end quantities with a focus on oil and liquid rich opportunities 
added midstream capacity and securing transportation capacity additional dedicated transportation and processing through a newly constructed third party pipeline of a midstream provider handling natural gas production from our awp eagle ford and olmos areas became operational at the beginning of october in our fasken area  we also secured capacity on a pipeline built in late by a midstream provider  and in both the awp and fasken areas we have secondary transportation outlets available if capacity is restricted on our primary outlets 
in june  we entered into an agreement for natural gas gathering and processing for our artesia wells eagle ford field 
capital cost saving measures we have realized significant capital cost savings in south texas related to pad drilling  well construction completion re design  sourcing transportation of proppants as well as increased productivity of our dedicated frac spread and crew 
our supply chain program continues to be extremely important and the relationships that we have developed with our service providers are critical to our program execution 
strategic growth initiatives during  the company intends to devote to of its budget to strategic growth initiatives in louisiana  including a horizontal well to test the wilcox formation in our south bearhead creek field and a well to test the niobrara oil formation in la plata county  colorado 
prospective joint venture in order to leverage the number of wells that can be drilled and our pace of drilling  the company is currently exploring opportunities to create a joint venture covering portions of the company highest value acreage in the eagle ford shale 
known trends and uncertainties affecting our business flattened production and cash flows in  we plan to reduce our capital expenditures by approximately to from levels  in order to live within the limits of reduced cash flow 
this is due to a lower commodity price environment  increased water production in lake washington leading to reduced anticipated base production during  and the dedication of up to of the year budget to long term strategic initiatives  facilities  gathering systems and other infrastructure 
recent declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids prices several factors such as increases in shale and tight sands production  mild winter weather  and relatively high natural gas storage levels have led to declining natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of through  with noted improvement in the later half of natural gas liquids prices have also declined recently due to many of the same reasons that natural gas prices have declined 
lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices equate to lower revenue and cash flows and might lead to reductions in our borrowing capacity 
as natural gas makes up of our reserves base on a boe basis  lower natural gas prices in the future could lead to potential reserves reductions which could result in full cost ceiling write downs 
oilfield services shortages and delays during periods of increased levels of exploration and production in particular areas  such as we are currently experiencing in the south texas area  there is increased demand for drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  oilfield services  and trained and experienced personnel 
the high demand in these areas has caused shortages and delays  which has raised costs and often delayed field development 
in south texas we have seen improvement in the availability of services as additional equipment has moved into this area 
employee retention as our competitors expand their workforce  we must focus more attention on keeping our highly skilled employees 
there has been and will be constant cost pressure to retain and hire these employees  and these costs do not decline as rapidly and significantly as hydrocarbon prices 

table of contents results of operations revenues years ended december   and our revenues in decreased by compared to revenues in  due to lower ngl and natural gas pricing  partially offset by higher natural gas and ngl production

had these amounts been recognized in the oil and gas sales account  our average oil price would have been  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and our average natural gas price would have been  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs and expenses our expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the prior year levels  for the reasons noted below 
lease operating expenses loe 
these expenses increased million  or  compared to the level of such expenses for the year ended december   due to higher workover costs in southeast louisiana and additional costs in our south texas region for transportation  salt water disposal and chemical treating 
our lease operating costs per boe produced  however were and for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to higher production volumes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
these expenses increased million  or  from those during the year ended december   due to a higher depletable base including higher future development costs and higher production volumes  partially offset by higher reserves volumes 
our dd a rate per boe of production was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting from increases in the per unit cost of reserves additions in general and administrative expenses  net 
these expenses increased million  or  compared to the level of such expenses for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher salaries and burdens  partially offset by a lower corporate benefit accrual 
for the years ended december  and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per boe produced were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
severance and other taxes 
these expenses decreased million  or  from the year ended december  severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents interest 
our gross interest cost for the year ended december  was million  of which million was capitalized 
our gross interest cost for the year ended december  was million  of which million was capitalized 
the increase in interest came from the million issuance of our senior notes due in november and the additional million issuance of our senior notes due in october income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to an increase in the ratio of non deductible expenses to net income  along with an increase in provision for state taxes  partially offset by a favorable adjustment to reverse a liability for an uncertain tax position for which the statutory audit period expired 
final recognition of new zealand sales proceeds 
in august  we completed the sale of our remaining new zealand permit for million  with three million payments spread over a month period 
the company initially deferred the gain on the sale due to legal claims around the transfer of this property 
in july  a settlement was reached and all legal claims were dismissed 
as a result  in the second quarter of the company recognized sale proceeds of million  net of million in capitalized costs in assets held for sale  relating to our remaining new zealand permit 
as of december   all payments under this sale agreement had been received and thus of the company oil and gas operations were in the united states of america 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities 
for the year ended december   our net cash provided by operating activities was million  representing a decrease compared to million generated during the million change was mainly due to the decline in commodity prices received during the year 
existing credit facility 
after the regularly scheduled review of our credit facility on october   the company borrowing base and commitment amount were increased to million from the previous borrowing base and commitment amounts of million and million  respectively 
the maturity of the credit facility was also extended to november  from may  at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
our available borrowings under our credit facility provide us liquidity 
in light of credit market volatility in recent years  which caused many financial institutions to experience liquidity issues  we periodically review the creditworthiness of the banks that fund our credit facility 
debt issuance 
on october   we issued an additional million of senior notes due on march  the notes were issued at of par  which equates to a yield to worst of 
the proceeds from this debt issuance were used to pay down the balance on our credit facility  which increased our available liquidity 
debt issuance 
we issued million of senior notes due in in november at of face value 
the proceeds from this debt issuance were recorded in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  and were used to fund capital expenditures in financial ratios working capital and debt to capitalization ratio 
our working capital decreased from a surplus of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the change primarily resulted from a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as we used cash received from our debt offerings in november and october to fund ongoing operations  including our capital program  and to pay down borrowings on our credit facility 
working capital  which is calculated as current assets less current liabilities  can be used to measure both a company operational efficiency and short term financial health 
the company uses this measure to track our short term financial position 
our working capital ratio does not include available liquidity through our credit facility 
our debt to capitalization ratio was and at december  and december   respectively

any amount of transportation utilized in excess of the minimum will reduce future year obligations 
the credit facility expires in november and these amounts exclude million standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements requiring disclosure pursuant to article a of regulation s k 
proved oil and gas reserves we have added proved reserves over the past three years primarily through our drilling activities  including mmboe added in  mmboe added in  and mmboe added in the proved reserves additions from drilling activities consisted primarily of additions in the artesia wells field in south texas  based on the results of the horizontal drilling program conducted in this area during the year  and also included additions in the burr ferry field 
we obtained reasonable certainty regarding these reserves additions by applying the same methodologies that have been used historically in this area 
at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end at year end  our proved reserves were mmboe with a pv value of billion pv value is a non gaap measure  see the section titled oil and natural gas reserves in our property section for a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the closest gaap measure  an increase in the pv value of approximately million  or  from the prior year end levels 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of mmboe  or 
we use the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first business day of each month in calculating our average prices used in the pv value calculation 
our average natural gas price used in the pv value calculation for was per mcf 
this average price during was a decrease from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end our average oil price used in the pv value calculation for was per bbl 
this average price during was slightly lower than the average price of per bbl at year end  compared to in critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized including internal costs incurred that are directly related to these activities and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
future development costs are estimated property by property based on current economic conditions and are amortized to expense as our capitalized oil and natural gas property costs are amortized 
we compute the provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties on a country by country basis using the unit of production method 

table of contents the costs of unproved properties not being amortized are assessed quarterly  on a property by property basis  to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining whether such costs should be impaired  we evaluate current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  international economic conditions  capital availability  and available geological and geophysical information 
as these factors may change from period to period  our evaluation of these factors will change 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
the calculation of the provision for dd a requires us to use estimates related to quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimates of unproved properties 
for both reserves estimates see discussion below and the impairment of unproved properties see discussion above  these processes are subjective  and results may change over time based on current information and industry conditions 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties including natural gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations and deferred income taxes  and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations  including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  adjusted for price differentials and the effects of cash flow hedges  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
see the discussion above related to reserves estimation 
given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could continue to change in the near term 
if oil and natural gas prices decline to any material degree from the prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is reasonably possible that non cash write downs of oil and gas properties would occur in the future 
if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes  which also reduce our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  non cash write downs of our oil and natural gas properties would occur in the future 
we cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be  thus we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential future non cash write down of our oil and natural gas properties if a decrease in oil and or natural gas prices were to occur

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
this commodity pricing volatility has continued with unpredictable price swings throughout our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
we do not utilize these agreements and financial instruments for trading and only enter into derivative agreements with banks in our credit facility 
price floors at december   we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments in place for future production 
income tax carryforwards 
as of december   the company has net deferred tax carryforward assets of million for federal net operating losses  for federal alternative minimum tax credits and million  net of a million valuation allowance  for deferred state tax net operating loss carryforwards which in management judgment will more likely than not be utilized to offset future taxable earnings 
changes in markets conditions or significant changes in the company ownership could impact our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
continued volatility in both credit and commodity markets may reduce the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers and from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit  parent company guaranties if applicable  and other collateral as considered necessary to reduce risk of loss 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
concentration of sales risk 
over the last several years  a large portion of our oil and gas sales have been to shell oil corporation and affiliates and we expect to continue this relationship in the future 
for the years ended december   and  shell oil company and affiliates accounted for  and of our total oil and gas gross receipts  respectively 
we believe that the risk of these unsecured receivables is mitigated by the short term sales agreements we have in place as well as the size  reputation and nature of their business 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes due in  and have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had million drawn under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows
