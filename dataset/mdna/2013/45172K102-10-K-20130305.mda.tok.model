income taxes 
at december   the company had net current deferred tax assets of  and net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of  the deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary differences in property and equipment  accrued expenses  and inventory reserves 
in connection with the recording of an impairment charge that occurred prior to as described below  the company has recorded a deferred tax asset and corresponding full valuation allowance in the amount of  as it is more likely than not that this asset will not be realized 
as of december  the fully reserved  deferred tax asset related to the capital loss can be carried forward two years and must be offset by a capital gain 
the company has determined that is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized and that an additional valuation allowance for such assets in not currently required

the company s net sales increased in to a record million compared to net sales of million in domestic realized a sales increase as sales grew from million in to million in  as both film and emulsion sales were stronger in due to improved distribution in the central region of the united states 
ikonics imaging also realized a sale increase in ikonics imaging s growth was mainly due to improved equipment sales volumes 
other sales in of million were flat with sales 
other sales in benefitted from improved dtx film sales and the sale of a dtx printer 
the company anticipates that in the future  dtx printer sales will be made directly by its strategic printer manufacturing partners and not the company 
offsetting these increases in other sales were decreases in micro machining due to a temporary purchasing delay at a large aerospace customer and a non repeating contract the company fulfilled in in addition to the company deemphasizing the machining of marginally profitable electronic wafers and shifting its emphasis to the machining of composites for the aerospace industry 
weaker sales to the middle east resulted in a decrease in export sales as sales dropped from million in to million in gross profit 
gross profit in was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in domestic  export and ikoinics imaging all realized small gross profit percentage improvement 
the gross margin percentage increases were mainly due to a combination of higher sales volumes and price increases 
the other gross margin decreased from in to in the period due to a decrease in the higher margin micro machining sales and the sale of a lower margin dtx printer which did not occur in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects higher expenses to support the company s dtx initiative along with increased export sales expenses related to the company s efforts to expand its presence in both europe and asia 
lower domestic and ikonics imaging sales expenses along with a decrease in micro machining consulting expenses partially offset these increases 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in were  or of sales  versus  or of sales  in the increase is partially related to a  abandonment of patent applications

in addition  the company transferred  of dtx equipment from inventory to equipment during the year 
the dtx equipment was purchased for inventory in instead of offering the dtx equipment for sale  the company decided it would be necessary to keep the equipment for product testing and customer demonstrations 
the company expects capital expenditures in of approximately  the planned expenditures primarily will be for manufacturing equipment necessary for anticipated micro machining aerospace business 
the company will also incur expenditures to improve its ability to test and demonstrate products 
these commitments are expected to be funded with cash generated from operating activities 
international activity the company markets its products in numerous countries in all regions of the world  including north america  europe  latin america  and asia 
the company s foreign sales of  were approximately of total sales  compared to the foreign sales of  which were of total sales 
the small decrease in foreign sales in was primarily due to a decrease in sales to the middle east 
the company is exposed to the risk of changes in social  political  and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  and the company s results of operations are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in foreign currencies have not significantly impacted the company s operations because the company s foreign sales are not concentrated in any one region of the world 
the company believes its vulnerability to uncertainties due to foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions in foreign countries is not significant 
the company s foreign transactions are primarily negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars  while a portion is transacted in euros 
ikonics has not implemented an economic hedging strategy to reduce the risk of foreign currency translation exposures  which management does not believe to be significant based on the scope and geographic diversity of the company s foreign operations as of december  furthermore  the impact of foreign exchange on the company s balance sheet and operating results was not material in either or future outlook ikonics has spent on average approximately of its sales dollars for the past few years in research and development and has made capital expenditures related to its dtx and micro machining programs 
the company plans to maintain its efforts in this area and expedite internal product development as well as form technological alliances with outside experts to commercialize new product opportunities 
the company continues to make progress on its new micro machining business initiative 
the company has entered into agreements with several major aerospace companies to determine the feasibility of using its unique technologies in the production of military and commercial aircraft 
the company is currently supplying products to two aerospace companies for use in the construction of new generation commercial aircraft 
although sequestration of the department of defense budget and delays in the launching of new commercial aircraft fleets could adversely affect some of these sales  progress is being made on a number of its in house feasibility projects  and the company believes that several of these could lead to ongoing business 
in anticipation of this business  the company is expanding its micro machining manufacturing capacity 
the company is also continuing to make progress on its dtx business initiatives 
in addition to its growing inkjet technology business  the company is having a good market reception to its complementary photographic technology film aimed at smaller users and has introduced a fluid for use in protoyping 
the company is currently working with its dtx customers on training  production optimization  and product improvements 
the company has been awarded european and united states patents on its dtx technologies 
domestically  both the chromaline screen print product and its ikonics imaging units remain profitable mature markets and require aggressive strategies to grow market share 
although there will be challenges  the company believes these businesses will continue to grow and prosper 
in addition to its traditional emphasis on domestic markets  the company will continue efforts to grow its business internationally by attempting to develop new markets and expanding market share where it has already established a presence
