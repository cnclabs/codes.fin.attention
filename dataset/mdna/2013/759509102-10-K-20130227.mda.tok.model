item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our results reflected growth over  but not at the level we had anticipated 
we began with positive momentum for both demand and pricing for the products we sell 
however  we saw consistent deterioration in overall metals pricing beginning in february that continued throughout demand also waned in most end markets we serve as the year progressed 
we believe that us  as well as global  political and economic uncertainty caused demand to subside 
these same factors also contributed to increased imports of metal products into the us and reductions in raw material costs that led to lower metals pricing 
we did see continued strength in the aerospace  auto mainly through our toll processing businesses and energy oil and gas end markets during  even though growth in the energy market slowed from levels and sequentially in each of the quarters during the year 
heavy industries such as mining equipment  barge and tank manufacturers  transmission towers and rail cars were also solid markets for us in our sales into the agricultural equipment end market were strong in the st half of but slowed in the nd half 
our sales into the non residential construction market improved somewhat over levels  primarily in the industrial construction market  but overall remain well below the peak levels in our sales of billion were our second best ever  and our earnings per share were the third best ever 
through the efforts of our employees  we increased our same store tons sold over and increased our gross profit margin to in a challenging business environment 
we ended in a strong financial position with our net debt to capital ratio at 
during we completed six acquisitions  with combined pro forma annual sales of approximately million 
these companies generally sell specialty products or provide high value processing  leading to higher selling prices and gross profit margins than the company average 
we also invested million in capital expenditures  our highest ever 
the majority of our capital expenditures related to growth activities  including the expansion and relocation of existing facilities  enhancing and adding processing capabilities  penetrating new geographic markets and expanding product offerings at existing locations 
we believe we have significantly higher earnings capacity from our current levels with exposure to industries that are poised for growth in the years ahead along with our broad and diverse product base and wide geographic footprint that positions us well in our industry 
however  until there is a significant improvement in demand  especially in the non residential construction market  we expect our results to be below what we believe our earnings power is  given the current size and breadth of the company 
we will continue to focus on maximizing the working capital management and profitability of our existing businesses and on profitable growth through both acquisitions and internal investment 
we have also consistently returned capital to our shareholders through dividends  with substantial increases in our quarterly dividend rate over the past two years 
looking forward  we expect that global economic uncertainty will continue to impact us economic growth 
however  we do expect pricing to improve from current levels and for volumes to steadily improve as we overcome the economic and political uncertainty and our customers gain more confidence 
our strong balance sheet provides a solid foundation for our operating activities and our growth strategies  both organic and through acquisitions  which we expect to aggressively pursue 
in february  we announced our agreement to acquire metals usa holdings corp 
in an all cash transaction for approximately billion 
if completed  this would be our largest acquisition to date  adding service center locations throughout the us and further strengthen our broad range of products  significant customer diversification and wide geographic footprint 
our operating and growth strategies 
table of contents have helped us achieve industry leading operating results on a consistent basis and we remain confident in our ability to continue this track record of success going forward 
effect of demand and pricing changes on our operating results customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases our revenue dollars increase  which then contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars  which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 
pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increase 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure other than for profit based compensation  the impact on our results of operations from changes in pricing is typically much greater than the effect of volume changes 
in addition  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this usually increases our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we typically generate stronger levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease 
recent developments in february  we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of metals usa holdings corp 
metals usa for per share in cash for a total equity purchase price of approximately million and assumption of approximately million of debt  for a total enterprise value of approximately billion 
the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of metals usa total assets as of december  and sales for the year then ended were approximately billion unaudited and billion unaudited  respectively 
the transaction has been unanimously approved by the respective boards of directors of reliance and metals usa 
the transaction is subject to approval by metals usa stockholders  along with the receipt of regulatory clearances and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions  and includes a day go shop period 
we anticipate funding the transaction with borrowings on our revolving credit facility  together with funds obtained from accessing the bank credit and debt capital markets

sunbelt increases our growing exposure to the energy market in high end  niche products serving customers across multiple oil and gas well drilling types  including vertical  horizontal  directional  and deepwater drilling applications 
sunbelt had net sales of million for the three months ended december  on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets of airport metals australia pty ltd  a subsidiary of samuel son co  limited  through our newly formed subsidiary bralco metals australia pty ltd 
airport metals 
airport metals  based in melbourne  operates as a stocking distributor of aircraft materials and supplies 
the addition of airport metals is our first entry into australia and enhances our ability to service important aerospace customers in that area 
net sales of airport metals during the period from july  through december  were million 
effective april    through our wholly owned subsidiary precision strip  inc psi  we acquired the assets of the worthington steel vonore  tennessee plant  a processing facility owned by worthington industries  inc the vonore plant operates as a psi location which processes and delivers carbon steel  aluminum and stainless steel products on a toll basis  processing the metal for a fee without taking ownership of the metal 
the addition of the vonore location to psi existing footprint of facilities allows psi to better service its customer base in an important geographic area of the country 
the vonore location net sales during the period from april  through december  were million 
effective april   we acquired all the outstanding limited liability company interests of national specialty alloys  llc nsa  a global specialty alloy processor and distributor of premium stainless steel and nickel alloy bars and shapes  headquartered in houston  texas

mckey was founded in and provides a full range of metal perforating and fabrication services to customers located primarily in the us mckey and diamond manufacturing company are working together to leverage their combined expertise in the perforated metal market and further expand our presence within that market 
mckey had net sales of million for the eleven months ended december  acquisition effective august   we acquired all the outstanding capital securities of continental alloys services  inc continental  headquartered in houston  texas  and certain affiliated companies 
continental is a leading global materials management company focused on high end steel and alloy pipe  tube and bar products and precision manufacturing of various tools designed for well completion programs of global energy service companies and has locations in seven countries including canada  malaysia  mexico  singapore  the uae  the united kingdom  and the united states 
this acquisition aligns well with our diversification strategy by increasing our exposure to the energy oil and gas market  including the addition of oil country tubular goods octg products  new processing capabilities  and entry into new international markets 
continental and its affiliates had combined net sales of million for the year ended december  
table of contents internal growth activities we continued to maintain our focus on organic growth by opening new facilities  building or expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment with total capital expenditures of million in  our highest to date 
this amount includes the purchase of six facilities that we previously leased  which will reduce our expenses 
our capital expenditure budget was million 
during we also consolidated and closed a few small operations that did not impact our ability to service our customers 
our capital expenditure budget is approximately million with much of this related to internal growth activities comprised of purchases of equipment and new facilities along with expansions of existing facilities 
we also plan to move out of various leased facilities and into newly built and or purchased ones 
this reflects our confidence in our long term prospects  however  we will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project and consider the economic conditions and outlook at the time 
we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures at about to million  which allows us to significantly reduce our capital expenditure spending if and when necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years ended december dollars are shown in millions and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of net sales of net sales of net sales net sales cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense shown below gross profit warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expense s  g a depreciation expense amortization expense operating income gross profit  calculated as net sales less cost of sales  and gross profit margin  calculated as gross profit divided by net sales  are non gaap financial measures as they exclude depreciation and amortization expense associated with the corresponding sales 
the majority of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed 
for the remainder of our sales orders  we perform first stage processing  which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size 
because of this  the amount of related labor and overhead  including depreciation and amortization  are not significant and are excluded from our cost of sales 
therefore  our cost of sales is primarily comprised of the cost of the material we sell 
we use gross profit and gross profit margin as shown above as measures of operating performance 
gross profit and gross profit margin are important operating and financial measures  as fluctuations in our gross profit margin can have a significant impact on our earnings 
gross profit and gross profit margin  as presented  are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies

same store amounts exclude the results of our and acquisitions 
in general  business activity in most all of our end markets was better in than in  albeit  the improvement in tons shipped decreased sequentially in each of the first three quarters of and in the fourth quarter declined due to extended holiday related closures at many of our customers 
we also believe that certain of our customers reduced purchasing activity near the end of the year as the us economy approached the fiscal cliff 
the combination of extended holiday closures and the pending fiscal cliff concerns caused our fourth quarter demand to decline more than typical seasonal slowdowns 
in  our strongest markets were aerospace  farm and heavy equipment  and auto through our toll processing businesses 
the energy oil and gas market  although down from levels  still continued to be one of our strongest 
non residential construction  our largest end market  exhibited moderate improvement  although at significantly reduced demand levels from its peak in since we primarily purchase and sell our inventories in the spot market  the changes in our average selling prices generally fluctuate in accordance with the changes in the costs of the various metals we purchase 
the mix of products sold can also have an impact on our average selling prices 
our and acquisitions  particularly continental and nsa which specialize in various alloy steel products  favorably impacted our average selling prices as their specialty products have higher selling prices than our company average  however  not enough to offset the overall decline in our selling prices 
our average selling prices declined from due to lower mill pricing for most of our products as a result of decreases in raw material and scrap costs at the mills as well as high import levels and domestic overcapacity that needed to be absorbed in the marketplace 
lower london metal exchange aluminum prices and reduced nickel surcharges were primarily responsible for the drop in common alloy aluminum and stainless steel prices  respectively 
as a result of decreasing mill prices during most of the year  we sold most products at lower average selling prices compared to levels 
our major product same store selling prices decreased in from levels as follows carbon steel down  aluminum down  stainless steel down  and 
table of contents alloy up 
as carbon steel sales represent slightly more than of our sales dollars  changes in carbon steel prices have a significant impact on changes in our overall average price per ton sold 
cost of sales year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change dollars in millions cost of sales the increase in cost of sales in compared to is due to increased tons sold  partially offset by lower product costs 
see net sales above for trends in both demand and costs of our products 
our inventory lifo valuation reserve adjustment  which is included in cost of sales and  in effect  reflects cost of sales at current replacement costs  resulted in a credit  or income  of million in compared to a charge  or expense  of million in our lifo valuation reserve as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
gross profit year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change dollars in millions gross profit higher gross profit margins in contributed approximately of the total increase in our gross profit of million 
the remaining increase in gross profit was from higher sales levels 
the improvement in our gross profit margin was primarily due to our ability to effectively manage our selling prices in an environment of declining mill prices

table of contents the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was mainly due to our and acquisitions and depreciation expense from our recent capital expenditures 
additionally  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to one of our trade name intangible assets for the year ended december   which is included in amortization expense 
operating income year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change dollars in millions operating income the higher gross profit dollars generated on higher sales  offset by only moderate increases in s  g a expenses and the contributions of our and acquisitions improved our operating income level in our operating income margin improved in mainly because of our improved gross profit margins and contributions from some of our and acquisitions  which produced higher operating returns due to the specialty nature of their products and processing services 
other income and expense year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change dollars in millions other income expense  net the change in other income expense  net in compared to was primarily due to higher foreign currency gains due to the weakening of the us dollar in compared to and higher investment returns on our life insurance assets 
income tax rate our effective income tax rate in was compared to our rate of 
the increase in our income tax rate was mainly due to higher income levels in as permanent items that lowered our effective income tax rates from the federal statutory rate were not materially different in amounts during both years and relate mainly to company owned life insurance policies  domestic production activities deductions and foreign income levels that are taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
net income year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change dollars in millions net income attributable to reliance the increase in our net income was primarily the result of higher gross profit dollars with relatively lower increases in our operating expenses  and contributions from our and acquisitions

we saw steady improvement in our tons sold in in general  business activity in most all of our markets was better in than in  albeit overall demand remained well below what we consider normal levels 
in  our strongest markets were energy oil and gas  aerospace  farm and heavy equipment  mining  general manufacturing and semiconductor and electronics 
non residential construction  our largest end market  continued to be our weakest  however  we saw some improvements in demand in for certain non residential construction related products in certain areas around the country 
as a result of increased mill prices  we were able to sell most products at higher average selling prices in compared to levels 
our major commodity selling prices increased in from levels as follows carbon steel up  aluminum up  stainless steel up  and alloy up 
the mill price increases over levels were primarily due to rises in scrap and other input costs at the mills rather than improved end market demand 
cost of sales year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change dollars in millions cost of sales the increase in cost of sales in compared to is due to increases in tons sold as well as increased costs for most products we sell from see net sales above for trends in both demand and costs of our products 

table of contents our inventory lifo valuation reserve adjustment resulted in a charge  or expense  of million in compared to a charge  or expense  of million in our inventory lifo valuation reserve as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
gross profit year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change dollars in millions gross profit we were able to generate higher gross profit dollars in due to overall higher average selling prices and demand for our products in compared to our gross profit margins  however  declined slightly from levels mainly due to increased pricing volatility in after experiencing significant price increases for most of our products through the first four months of  pricing began to decline and generally did not reverse its course until the end of the year  when the mills began announcing small price increases for many of our products to be effective in an environment of declining prices puts negative pressure on our gross profit margins as we may have to lower our selling prices prior to receiving the lower cost inventory on hand 
pricing volatility  especially when headed downward  also generally increases competition in our industry  which contributed to our lower gross profit margins in see also cost of sales above for discussion of our lifo valuation reserve adjustments

other income and expense interest expense in was million  a decrease of million from million in the effects of increased borrowings on our revolving credit facility that were primarily due to funding our increased working capital needs and our acquisition were offset by lower borrowing rates in  as a result of restating our credit facility in july income tax rate our effective income tax rate in was compared to our rate of 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to favorable state law changes to apportionment weights and the continental acquisition  which caused a shift in our state apportionment rates that lowered our state income tax rates as well as increased our foreign income levels that are taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate of 
net income year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change dollars in millions net income attributable to reliance the significant increase in our net income was primarily the result of a more favorable demand and pricing environment for our products  which has allowed us to generate increased gross profit dollars with relatively lower increases in our operating expenses 
net income margin improved primarily due to higher sales levels and a relatively consistent cost structure as discussed in expenses above 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to higher profitability levels and a larger working capital primarily accounts receivable and inventories investment requirement in as compared to when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase 
when demand and pricing falls  we typically generate higher levels of cash flow from operating activities as our working capital needs decrease 
throughout  both volume and pricing for our products were increasing  requiring a larger investment in working capital 
in  particularly in the fourth quarter  demand for our products was 
table of contents declining  and by aligning our working capital needs with current business levels we generated a significant amount of cash flow from operating activities 
to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding and on our inventory turnover rate  as receivables and inventory are the two most significant elements of our working capital 
at december   our days sales outstanding rate was approximately days compared to days at december  our inventory turn rate based on dollars during was about times or months on hand  compared to our rate of times or months on hand 
lower demand levels in the latter part of negatively impacted our inventory turns 
investing activities capital expenditures were million in compared to million in the majority of our capital expenditures related to growth initiatives to expand or relocate existing facilities  to purchase properties that were previously leased  to add or upgrade equipment  and to meet ongoing maintenance requirements 
we also spent million on acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  compared to million in financing activities our capital expenditures and the acquisitions were largely funded by our cash from operations and the borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
we paid dividends to our shareholders of million in on february   our board of directors declared the first quarter regular cash dividend of per share of common stock  an increase of from per share in fourth quarter we have increased our dividend times since our ipo in and have paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders for consecutive years 
liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our internally generated funds from operations and our billion revolving credit facility 
our total outstanding debt at december  was billion  down from billion at december  at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings on our billion revolving credit facility 
as of december   our net debt to capital ratio was  down from as of december  on july   we amended and restated our existing syndicated credit agreement to increase the borrowing limit from billion to billion  and to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility for a five year term to july  the amended and restated revolving credit facility has banks as lenders 
interest on borrowings from the amended and restated revolving credit facility is at variable rates based on libor plus or the bank prime rate plus as of december  the amended and restated revolving credit facility includes a commitment fee on the unused portion  at an annual rate of as of december  the applicable margin over libor rate and base rate borrowings  along with commitment fees  are subject to adjustment every quarter based on our leverage ratio  as defined 
we also have various other separate revolving credit facilities with a combined credit limit of approximately million that are in place for operations in asia and europe as of december  these revolving credit facilities had combined outstanding balances of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
capital resources on november   we entered into an indenture the indenture  for the issuance of million of unsecured debt securities 
the total debt issued was comprised of two tranches  
table of contents a million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  and b million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  the notes are senior unsecured obligations of reliance and rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of reliance 
the senior unsecured notes include provisions that  in the event of a change in control and a downgrade of our credit rating  require us to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
at december   we also had million of outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in private placements of debt 
the outstanding senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and mature in july our net debt to total capital ratio was at december   down from december  rate of net debt to total capital is calculated as total debt  net of cash  divided by reliance shareholders equity plus total debt  net of cash 
as of december   we had million of debt obligations coming due before our billion revolving credit facility expires july  we are comfortable that we will have adequate cash flow and capacity on our revolving credit facility to fund our debt obligations as well as our working capital  capital expenditure  growth and other needs 
we expect to continue our acquisition and other growth activities and anticipate that we will be able to fund such activities with cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
however  to complete the acquisition of metals usa  we will need to raise additional funds 
see also discussion under recent developments in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a merger agreement that we entered into in february covenants the amended and restated revolving credit facility and the senior unsecured note agreements collectively require us to maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio and include a change of control provision  among other things 
our interest coverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december  was approximately times compared to the debt covenant minimum requirement of times interest coverage ratio is calculated as net income attributable to reliance plus interest expense and provision for income taxes and plus or minus any non operating non recurring loss or gain  respectively  divided by interest expense 
our leverage ratio as of december  calculated in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility was compared to the financial covenant maximum amount of leverage ratio is calculated as total debt  inclusive of capital lease obligations and outstanding letters of credit  divided by reliance shareholders equity plus total debt 
the minimum net worth requirement as of december  was billion compared to reliance shareholders equity balance of billion as of december  additionally  all of our owned domestic subsidiaries  which constitute the substantial majority of our subsidiaries  guarantee the borrowings under the revolving credit facility  the indenture and the private placement notes 
the subsidiary guarantors  together with reliance  are required collectively to account for at least of our consolidated ebitda and of consolidated tangible assets 
reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately of our total consolidated ebitda for the last twelve months and approximately of total consolidated tangible assets as of december  we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  
table of contents which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were contingently liable under standby letters of credit in the aggregate amounts of million and million  respectively 
the letters of credit related to insurance policies  construction projects  and outstanding bonds 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations estimated interest on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total interest is estimated using applicable rates as of december  for our outstanding fixed and variable rate debt based on their respective scheduled maturities 
also  the entire outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility of million is assumed to remain unchanged until its maturity date in july the majority of our inventory purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace related materials 
includes the estimated benefit payments for the next ten years for various long term retirement plans 
for qualified defined benefit plans we have only included the estimated employer contribution amounts for as funding projections beyond are not practical to estimate 
we have excluded deferred income taxes of million  long term tax contingencies of million and other long term liabilities of million from the amounts presented  as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace related materials 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods 
table of contents or services  pricing in effect at that time for inventory purchase commitments  or due to changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers are in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses 
our geographic  product and customer diversity reduces the impact of seasonal trends on our operating results 
however  revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   we revised our internal reporting package for our chief operation decision maker our chief executive officer and our board of directors in order to better align internal reporting with the way performance is measured and key resource allocation decisions are made  which are primarily based on enterprise level data 
as part of the segment reassessment process triggered by this change in accordance with the guidance provided within the segment reporting topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification codification  we concluded that we have one operating segment and also one reporting unit for goodwill impairment purposes 
there was no change in our reportable segments  we have one reportable segment  metals service centers 
goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to billion as of december   or approximately of total assets or of reliance shareholders equity 
additionally  other intangible assets  net amounted to million at december   or approximately of total assets or of reliance shareholders equity 
goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
refer to critical accounting policies and estimates for further discussion regarding judgments involved in testing for recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the 
table of contents results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectability of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues such as bankruptcy status  our past collection history  and current financial and credit agency reports along with current economic pressures impacting that customer or industry 
accounts that we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and probable future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories a significant portion of our inventory is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
under this method  older costs are included in inventory  which may be higher or lower than current costs 
this method of valuation is subject to year to year fluctuations in our cost of material sold  which is influenced by the inflation or deflation existing within the metals industry as well as fluctuations in our product mix and on hand inventory levels 
at december   cost on the first in  first out fifo method exceeded our lifo value of inventories by million 
the calculation of lifo does not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments  except at interim reporting periods 
furthermore  considering that our current inventory values as reflected in our financial statements on a lifo basis are significantly below fifo costs  valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market is also not subject to significant estimates or judgments 
however  we do maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information regarding our deferred tax assets and liabilities  provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our 
table of contents estimates of credits or deductions  changes in our assessment of tax exposure items  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities  among others 
long lived assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives annually or whenever significant events or changes occur  which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances  indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable  include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization  declines in the market conditions of our products  reductions in our future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry  among others 
we review the recoverability of our intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives by making assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets  as necessary 
we test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method  as necessary 
we perform the required annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment evaluation as of november of each year 
no impairment of goodwill was determined to exist for the years ended december   or we recognized an impairment loss of million related to one of our trade name intangible assets for the year ended december  no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives was recognized for the years ended december  or impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
additionally  considerable declines in the market conditions for our products from current levels as well as in the price of our common stock could also significantly impact our impairment analysis 
an impairment charge  if incurred  could be material 
long lived assets other we review the recoverability of our other lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
commodity price risk metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
because we primarily purchase and sell in the spot market we are able to react quickly to changes in metals pricing 
this strategy also limits our exposure to commodity prices to our inventories on hand 
in an environment of increasing material 
table of contents costs our pricing usually increases as we try to maintain the same gross profit percentage and typically generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
in periods where demand deteriorates rapidly and metal prices are declining significantly in a compressed period of time  a portion of our inventory on hand may be at higher costs than our selling prices  causing a significant adverse effect on our gross profit and pre tax income margins 
however  when prices stabilize and our inventories on hand reflect more current prices  our gross profit margins tend to return to more normalized levels 
foreign exchange rate risk because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
the currency effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries  which operate in local currency environments  are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and do not impact earnings unless there is a liquidation or sale of those foreign subsidiaries 
we do not hedge our net investments in foreign subsidiaries due to the long term nature of those investments 
total foreign currency transaction gains and losses impacting earnings were as follows million of gain in  million of losses in and million of gains in during  our primary exposure to foreign currency rates that impacted our earnings related to certain outstanding intercompany balances with our canadian operations that were not hedged 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we do not currently anticipate repayment of our fixed rate long term debt prior to scheduled maturities 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
as of december   our total variable interest rate debt outstanding amounted to approximately million  which was primarily comprised of the borrowings on our revolving credit facility of million 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates on million of debt would result in approximately million of additional interest expense on an annual basis
