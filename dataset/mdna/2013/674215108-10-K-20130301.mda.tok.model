table of contents part i item business overview oasis petroleum inc together with our consolidated subsidiaries  the company  we  us  or our is an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the montana and north dakota regions of the williston basin 
as of december   we have accumulated  net leasehold acres in the williston basin 
we are currently exploiting significant resource potential from the bakken and three forks formations  which are present across a substantial portion of our acreage 
we believe the location  size and concentration of our acreage in our core project areas create an opportunity for us to achieve cost  recovery and production efficiencies through the large scale development of our project inventory 
our management team has a proven track record in identifying  acquiring and executing large  repeatable development drilling programs  which we refer to as resource conversion opportunities  and has substantial williston basin experience 
in  we completed and placed on production gross operated wells in the williston basin 
we have built our williston basin leasehold acreage position primarily through acquisitions and development in our three primary project areas west williston  east nesson and sanish 
degolyer and macnaughton  our independent reserve engineers  estimated our net proved reserves to be mmboe as of december   of which were classified as proved developed and of which were oil 
the following table presents summary data for each of our primary project areas as of december  productive estimated net proved reserves as of average daily bakken and three forks wells december  production project area net acreage gross net mmboe developed boe d west williston east nesson sanish total our history oasis petroleum inc was incorporated in february pursuant to the laws of the state of delaware to become a holding company for oasis petroleum llc op llc  our predecessor  which was formed as a delaware limited liability company in february by certain members of our senior management team and certain private equity funds 
we completed our initial public offering ipo in june in connection with our ipo and related corporate reorganization  we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in op llc in exchange for shares of our common stock 
oasis petroleum north america llc opna conducts our exploration and production activities and owns our proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties 
in  we formed oasis well services llc ows  which provides well services to opna  and oasis petroleum marketing llc opm  which provides marketing services to opna 
our business strategy our goal is to enhance value by investing capital to build reserves  production and cash flows at attractive rates of return through the following strategies develop our williston basin leasehold position 
we intend to continue to drill and develop our acreage position to maximize the value of our resource potential 
during  we completed and brought on production gross net operated bakken and three forks wells in the williston basin 
as of december   we had gross operated wells waiting on completion and gross operated wells drilling in the bakken and three forks formations 
our drilling plan contemplates completing approximately gross net operated wells in our project areas 
we believe we have the ability to increase or decrease the number of wells drilled during based on market conditions and program results 
focus on operational and cost efficiencies 
our management team is focused on continuous improvement of our operations and has significant experience in successfully converting early stage resource conversion opportunities into cost efficient development projects 
we believe the magnitude and concentration of our acreage within our project areas provide us with the opportunity to capture economies of scale  including the ability to drill multiple wells from a single drilling pad  utilizing centralized production and oil  gas and water fluid handling facilities and infrastructure and reducing the time and cost of rig mobilization 
in addition  ows is expected to continue to provide capital savings and decrease our operated well capital costs going forward 

table of contents adopt and employ leading drilling and completion techniques 
our team is focused on enhancing our drilling and completion techniques to maximize overall well economics 
we believe these techniques have significantly evolved over the last several years  resulting in increased initial production rates and recoverable hydrocarbons per well through the implementation of techniques such as drilling longer laterals and more tightly spacing fracturing stimulation stages 
we continuously evaluate our internal drilling and completion results and monitor the results of other operators to improve our operating practices 
this continued evolution may enhance our initial production rates  ultimate recovery factors and rate of return on invested capital 
pursue strategic acquisitions with significant resource potential 
as opportunities arise  we intend to identify and acquire additional acreage and producing assets in the williston basin to supplement our existing operations 
going forward  we may selectively target additional basins that would allow us to employ our resource conversion strategy on large undeveloped acreage positions similar to what we have accumulated in the williston basin 
maintain financial flexibility and conservative financial position 
we are committed to maintaining a conservative financial strategy by managing our liquidity position and leverage levels 
as of december   we had no borrowings and million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and million of liquidity available  including million in cash and short term investments and million available under our revolving credit facility 
this liquidity position  along with internally generated cash flows  will provide additional financial flexibility as we continue to develop our acreage position in the williston basin 
we also have access to the public equity and debt markets  and we intend to maintain a conservative  balanced capital structure by prudently raising proceeds from future offerings as additional capital needs arise 
our competitive strengths we have a number of competitive strengths that we believe will help us to successfully execute our business strategies substantial leasehold position in one of north america s leading unconventional oil resource plays 
as of december   our  net leasehold acres in the williston basin were highly prospective in the bakken and three forks formations and of our mmboe estimated net proved reserves in this area were comprised of oil 
we increased our operated drill blocks by through acreage additions and trades during in addition  we have  net acres held by production as of december  we believe our acreage is one of the largest concentrated leasehold positions that is prospective in the bakken and three forks formations  and much of our acreage is in areas of significant drilling activity by other exploration and production companies 
we expect that the scale and concentration of our acreage will enable us to reduce our drilling and completion costs and improve operational efficiency as we transition to full development mode throughout large  multi year project inventory 
we believe we have a large inventory of potential drilling locations that we have not yet drilled  a majority of which is operated by us 
we plan to complete gross net operated wells in the williston basin in management team with proven operating and acquisition skills 
our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry 
our senior technical team has an average of more than years of industry experience  including experience in multiple north american resource plays as well as experience in international basins 
we believe our management and technical team is one of our principal competitive strengths relative to our industry peers due to our team s proven track record in identification  acquisition and execution of resource conversion opportunities 
in addition  our technical team possesses substantial expertise in horizontal drilling techniques and managing and acquiring large development programs and also has prior experience in the williston basin 
incentivized management team 
as of december   our executive officers owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we believe our executive officers ownership interest in us provides them with significant incentives to grow the value of our business for the benefit of all stakeholders 
operating control over the majority of our portfolio 
in order to maintain better control over our asset portfolio  we have established a leasehold position comprised primarily of properties that we expect to operate 
we expect to operate approximately of our gross drilling locations  or of our net drilling locations 
as of december   of our estimated net proved reserves were attributable to properties that we expect to operate 
approximately of our drilling and completion capital expenditure budget is related to operated wells 
as of december   our average working interest in our operated and non operated identified drilling locations was and  respectively 
controlling operations will allow us to dictate the pace of development as well as the costs  type and timing of exploration and development activities 
we believe that maintaining operational control over the majority of our acreage will allow us to better pursue our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and maximizing hydrocarbon recovery through continuous improvement of drilling and completion techniques 
we are also better able to control infrastructure investment to drive down operating costs and increase gas production and oil price realizations 

table of contents our operations estimated net proved reserves the table below summarizes our estimated net proved reserves and related pv at december   and for each of our project areas based on reports prepared by degolyer and macnaughton  our independent reserve engineers 
in preparing its reports  degolyer and macnaughton evaluated properties representing all of our pv at december   and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities 
our estimated net proved reserves were determined using the preceding twelve months unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month prices and do not include probable or possible reserves

these prices were adjusted by lease for quality  transportation fees  geographical differentials  marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 
pv is a non gaap financial measure and generally differs from standardized measure  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it does not include the effect of income taxes on discounted future net cash flows 
neither pv nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties 
the oil and gas industry uses pv as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities 
see reconciliation of pv to standardized measure below 
standardized measure represents the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  less estimated future development  production  plugging and abandonment costs and income tax expenses if applicable  discounted at per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows 
reconciliation of pv to standardized measure pv is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  which is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
pv is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre tax basis 
pv is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date  before deducting future income taxes  discounted at percent 
we believe that the presentation of pv is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes  and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties 
further  investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies 
we use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties 
pv  however  is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
our pv measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
the following table provides a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at december   and december  in millions pv present value of future income taxes discounted at standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows the pv of our estimated net proved reserves at december  was  million  a increase from pv of  million at december  this increase was mainly due to an increase in reserves and a reduction in costs  partially offset by lower commodity price assumptions year over year

the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months were bbl for oil and mmbtu for natural gas  bbl for oil and mmbtu for natural gas  and bbl for oil and mmbtu for natural gas for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these prices were adjusted by lease for quality  transportation fees  geographical differentials  marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 
future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of proved reserves net of production and development costs including operating expenses and production taxes 
such calculations at december   and are based on costs in effect at december of each year and the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for january through december of such year  without giving effect to derivative transactions  and are held constant throughout the life of the properties 
there can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated or that prices and costs will remain constant 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties 
proved undeveloped reserves at december   we had approximately mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves as compared to mmboe at december  the following table summarizes the changes in our proved undeveloped reserves during in mboe at december  extensions  discoveries and other additions purchases of minerals in place sales of minerals in place revisions of previous estimates conversion to proved developed reserves at december  during  we spent a total of million related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves  million of which was spent on proved undeveloped reserves that still remain proved undeveloped at year end 
the remaining million resulted in the conversion of  mboe of proved undeveloped reserves  or of our proved undeveloped reserves balance at the beginning of  to proved developed reserves 
we added  mboe of proved undeveloped reserves across all three of our project areas as a result of our operated and non operated drilling program 
in  we also had a net negative revision of  mboe  or of our december  proved undeveloped reserves balance 
the primary causes for these revisions were negative well performances partially offset by working interest increases in the proved undeveloped locations 
within portions of the west williston and east nesson project areas  actual well results underperformed relative to the proved undeveloped forecasts prepared in the proved undeveloped forecasts in these areas have been adjusted to reflect these well performances in the reserve report 
the working interest increases arose from acreage trades  non participation by other interest owners and additional mineral leasing in the reserve locations 
operating costs and realized prices had an immaterial impact on the proved undeveloped reserves balance 
all of our proved undeveloped reserves as of december  are expected to be developed within five years of their initial booking

technology used to establish proved reserves in accordance with rules and regulations of the sec applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities  proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations 
the term reasonable certainty means deterministically  the quantities of oil and or natural gas are much more likely to be achieved than not  and probabilistically  there should be at least a probability of recovering volumes equal to or exceeding the estimate 
reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by using reliable technology 
reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation 
in order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated net proved reserves  degolyer and macnaughton employed technologies including  but not limited to  electrical logs  radioactivity logs  core analyses  geologic maps and available down hole and production data  seismic data and well test data 
reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships 
reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity 
in addition to assessing reservoir continuity  geologic data from well logs  core analyses and seismic data related to the bakken formation were used to estimate original oil in place 
in areas where estimated proved reserves were attributed to more than one well per spacing unit  the estimated original oil in place was used to calculate reasonable estimated recovery factors based on experience with similar reservoirs where similar drilling and completion techniques have been employed 
internal controls over reserves estimation process we employ degolyer and macnaughton as the independent reserves evaluator for of our reserves base 
we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with the independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of data furnished for the reserves estimation process

production  revenues and price history oil and natural gas are commodities 
the price that we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand 
demand for oil and natural gas in the united states has increased dramatically over the last ten years 
however  the economic slowdown during the second half of and through reduced this demand 
in  and  demand for oil and natural gas increased as the economy recovered 
demand is impacted by general economic conditions  weather and other seasonal conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms 
over or under supply of oil or natural gas can result in substantial price volatility 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile  and we expect that volatility to continue in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets

our drilling activity has increased each year since our inception 
exploration wells in and primarily focused on delineation and appraisal of the bakken formation in our west williston and east nesson areas 
in  we continued this focus on delineation  resulting in substantially all of our acreage being delineated in the bakken formation and continued delineation in the three forks formation as of december  we also continued to participate in a number of wells on a non operated basis 
in  we had two gross development dry hole wells as a result of mechanical failures 
replacement wells were drilled in the same drilling spacing units  which were successful in finding and producing hydrocarbons 
in and  we allocated a portion of the costs for a well that was unsuccessful due to mechanical complications in the three forks formation to exploratory dry hole expense 
the well was successfully plugged back and completed in the bakken formation 
we did not drill any dry hole wells in consistent with our capital plan  we expect to continue to focus on drilling in the bakken and three forks formations 
capital expenditure budget in  we spent  million on capital expenditures  which represented a increase over the million spent during this increase was a result of continued improvement of industry conditions and drilling and completion technology in the bakken and three forks formations as well as increased economics in the area and an increase in total net wells drilled in see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources cash flows used in investing activities 

table of contents our total capital expenditure budget is  million  which includes million for exploration and production e p capital expenditures and million for non e p capital expenditures 
our planned capital expenditures primarily consist of million of drilling and completion capital expenditures for operated and non operated wells including expected savings from services provided by ows  million for constructing infrastructure to support production in our core project areas  primarily related to salt water disposal systems  million for maintaining and expanding our leasehold position  million for micro seismic work  purchasing seismic data and other test work  million for facilities and other miscellaneous e p capital expenditures  million for ows  and million for other non e p capital  including items such as administrative capital and capitalized interest 
while we have budgeted  million for these purposes  the ultimate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions and the success of our drilling results as the year progresses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our core project areas williston basin our operations are focused in the north dakota and montana areas of the williston basin 
while we have interests in a substantial number of wells in the williston basin that target several different zones  our exploration and development activities are currently concentrated in the bakken and three forks formations 
our management team originally targeted the williston basin because of its oil prone nature  multiple  stacked producing horizons  substantial resource potential and management s previous professional history in the basin 
the williston basin also has established infrastructure and access to materials and services 
regulatory delays are minimal in the williston basin due to fee ownership of properties  efficient state and local regulatory bodies and reasonable permitting requirements 
the entire williston basin is spread across north dakota  south dakota  montana and parts of southern canada 
the basin produces oil and natural gas from numerous producing horizons including  but not limited to  the bakken  three forks  madison and red river formations 
the williston basin is now one of the most actively drilled unconventional oil resource plays in the united states  with approximately rigs drilling in the basin  including in north dakota and in montana  based on anderson reports weekly rig count dated january  a report issued by the united states geological survey in april classified these formations as the largest continuous oil accumulation ever assessed by it in the contiguous united states 
the devonian age bakken formation is found within the williston basin underlying portions of north dakota and montana and is comprised of three lithologic members including the upper shale  middle bakken and lower shale 
the formation ranges up to feet thick 
the upper and lower shales are highly organic  thermally mature and over pressured and can act as both a source and reservoir for the oil 
the middle bakken  which varies in composition from a silty dolomite to shaley limestone or sand  also serves as a reservoir and is a critical component for commercial production 
generally  the bakken formation is found at vertical depths of  to  feet 
based on our geologic interpretation of the bakken formation  the evolution of completion techniques  our own drilling results and publicly available drilling results for other operators in the basin  we believe that a substantial portion of our williston basin acreage is prospective in the bakken formation 
the three forks formation  generally found immediately under the bakken formation  has also proven to contain productive reservoir rock that may add incremental reserves to our existing leasehold positions 
the three forks formation typically consists of interbedded dolomites and shale with local development of a discontinuous sandy member at the top  known as sanish sand 
the three forks formation is an unconventional carbonate play 
based on our geologic interpretation of the three forks formation  the evolution of completion techniques  our own drilling results and publicly available drilling results for other operators in the basin  we believe that much of our williston basin acreage is prospective in the three forks formation 
our total leasehold position in the williston basin as of december  consisted of  net acres 
our estimated net proved reserves in the williston basin were mmboe at december  of our estimated net proved reserves in the williston basin  approximately mmboe were proved developed reserves  which are comprised of a combination of wells drilled to conventional reservoirs  bakken wells drilled with older completion techniques and bakken and three forks wells drilled with completion techniques similar to those we currently employ 
based on our results to date  we estimate that the bakken and three forks wells drilled with more recent completion techniques will achieve estimated ultimate recovery rates that will in many cases more than double the ultimate recovery rates we expect from the bakken wells with older completion techniques 
based on publicly available information for other operators in the basin  we believe this trend towards higher recovery rates is generally consistent across the basin 
of our estimated net proved reserves  mmboe were proved undeveloped reserves  all of which consisted of bakken and three forks wells to be drilled with more recent completion techniques 
we expect that all of our identified drilling locations in each of our project areas will be drilled and completed using completion techniques similar to those we currently employ 

table of contents as of december   we had a total of net operated and non operated producing wells and net operated producing wells in the williston basin 
we had average daily production of  net boe d for the year ended december  in the williston basin 
during  our bakken and three forks wells produced a daily average of  net boe d with net producing wells on december  accordingly  our net bakken and three forks wells were responsible for of our average daily production during as of december   our working interest for all producing wells averaged and in the wells we operate was approximately 
as of december   we were drilling or completing gross net wells in the williston basin 
we participated in gross net wells that were completed and brought on production during currently  we estimate our capital expenditures for will be  million  which includes completing gross net horizontal operated wells  participating in net non operated wells that are expected to be completed and brought on production  construction of infrastructure to support production and leasehold acquisitions 
since most of this capital is expected to be spent on horizontal drilling in the bakken and three forks formations  we expect that the proportion of our production from these formations will grow in the future 
our williston basin activities are evaluated in three primary areas of operations west williston  east nesson and sanish

table of contents marketing  transportation and major customers the williston basin crude oil transportation and refining infrastructure has grown substantially in recent years  largely in response to drilling activity in the bakken formation 
in december  oil production in north dakota was approximately  barrels per day compared to approximately  barrels per day in december according to a presentation from the north dakota pipeline authority dated january   there were approximately  barrels per day of crude oil pipeline transportation capacity in the williston basin as of december  in addition  approximately  barrels per day of specifically dedicated railcar transportation capacity has been placed into service as of december  in  we began selling a significant amount of our crude oil production from our west williston project area through gathering systems connected to multiple pipeline and rail facilities 
these gathering systems  which originate at the wellhead  reduce the need to transport barrels by truck from the wellhead 
as of december   we flowed approximately of our gross operated oil production through these gathering systems 
we will continue to implement wellhead gathering of crude oil in with the implementation of gathering connections in our east nesson project area  which we expect will increase the gross operated oil production that will flow on these systems to over by mid year recent expansion of both rail and pipeline facilities has reduced the previous constraint on oil transportation out of the williston basin and improved netback pricing received at the lease 
however  oil from canada has put pressure on the existing pipeline infrastructure from the williston basin that terminates at midwest refineries 
in addition  although there were  barrels per day of railcar transportation capacity in place as of december   these railcar facilities are not yet running at nameplate capacity due to initial commissioning  limited crude oil supply and limited availability of railcars 
we believe the operators of these railcar facilities have railcars on order and expect utilization on these facilities to continue to increase substantially during for a discussion of the potential risks to our business that could result from transportation and refining infrastructure constraints in the williston basin  please see item a 
risk factors risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business insufficient transportation or refining capacity in the williston basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices 
we principally sell our oil and natural gas production to refiners  marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline and rail facilities 
our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control  the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted 
for a description of some of these factors  please see item a 
risk factors risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production and risk factors risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business insufficient transportation or refining capacity in the williston basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices 
in an effort to improve price realizations from the sale of our oil and natural gas  we manage our commodities marketing activities in house  which enables us to market and sell our oil and natural gas to a broader array of potential purchasers 
due to the availability of other markets and pipeline connections  we do not believe that the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
for the year ended december   sales to musket corporation accounted for approximately of our total sales 
for the year ended december   sales to texon lp  plains all american pipeline  lp and enserco energy inc accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total sales 
for the year ended december   sales to plains all american pipeline  lp  texon lp and whiting petroleum corporation accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total sales 
no other purchasers accounted for more than of our total oil and natural gas sales for the years ended december   and we believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations  as there are a number of alternative crude oil and natural gas purchasers in our project areas 
as of december   we sold a substantial majority of our oil and condensate through bulk sales from delivery points on crude oil gathering systems or directly at the wellhead to a variety of purchasers at prevailing market prices under short term contracts that normally provide for us to receive a market based price  which incorporates regional differentials that include  but are not limited to  transportation costs and adjustments for product quality 
crude oil produced and sold in the williston basin has historically sold at a discount to the price quoted for nymex west texas intermediate wti crude oil due to transportation costs and takeaway capacity 
in the past  there have been periods when this discount has substantially increased due to the production of oil in the area increasing to a point that it temporarily surpasses the available pipeline transportation  rail transportation and refining capacity in the area 
in the first half of  price differentials were at or above the historical average discount range of to to the price quoted for wti crude oil due to production growth in the williston basin combined with refinery and transportation constraints 
in the third quarter of  differentials began to narrow  primarily due to the transportation capacity additions discussed above outpacing production growth 
in the fourth quarter of  these price differentials continued to narrow and at some points crude oil produced in the williston basin sold at a premium to wti as a result of additional transportation capacity additions which access east and west coast refineries 

table of contents since most of our oil and natural gas production is sold under market based or spot market contracts  the revenues generated by our operations are highly dependent upon the prices of and demand for oil and natural gas 
the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control  including but not limited to seasonality  weather  competition  availability of transportation and gathering capabilities  the condition of the united states economy  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing and natural gas producing regions  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies

please see item a 
risk factors risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
competition the oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in all phases 
we encounter competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operation  including the acquisition of leasing options on oil and natural gas properties to the exploration and development of those properties 
our competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies  numerous independent oil and natural gas companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of our competitors are large  well established companies that have substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do 
such companies may be able to pay more for lease options on oil and natural gas properties and exploratory locations and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or human resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
please see item a 
risk factors risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  making it more difficult for us to acquire properties  market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel 
title to properties as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we initially conduct a preliminary review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties  we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant title defects 
to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties  we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense 
we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property 
we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with general industry standards 
prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases  we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and  depending on the materiality of the properties  we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions 
our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests  liens to secure borrowings under our revolving credit facility  liens for current taxes and other burdens  which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect our carrying value of the properties 
please see item a 
risk factors risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 
seasonality winter weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit or temporarily halt our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations 
these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 
such seasonal anomalies can also pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and may increase competition for equipment  supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months  which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay or temporarily halt our operations 
regulation of the oil and natural gas industry our operations are substantially affected by federal  state and local laws and regulations 
in particular  oil and natural gas production and related operations are  or have been  subject to price controls  taxes and numerous other laws and regulations 
all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate properties for oil and natural gas production have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas  including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells  bonding requirements to drill or operate wells  the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the number of wells which may be drilled in an area  and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells  as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells 

table of contents failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability 
although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations  such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted 
additionally  currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered 
therefore  we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance 
additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by congress  the states  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the courts 
we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
regulation of transportation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices 
nevertheless  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
the transportation of oil by common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation 
the ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act 
in general  interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost based  although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances 
effective january   the ferc implemented regulations establishing an indexing system based on inflation for transportation rates for oil pipelines that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to a prescribed ceiling  without making a cost of service filing 
every five years  the ferc reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs 
most recently  on december   the ferc established a new price index for the five year period beginning july  intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions 
the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation  and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates  varies from state to state 
insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers  we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated 
further  interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non discriminatory basis 
under this open access standard  common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates 
when oil pipelines operate at full capacity  access is generally governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines published tariffs 
accordingly  we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors 
regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by the ferc under the natural gas act of nga  the natural gas policy act of ngpa and regulations issued under those statutes 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold 
while sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the ngpa and culminated in adoption of the natural gas wellhead decontrol act which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  ferc regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates  and terms and conditions of service  which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas 
since  the ferc has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non discriminatory basis 
the ferc has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by  among other things  unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services 
beginning in  the ferc issued a series of orders  beginning with order no 
 to implement its open access policies 
as a result  the interstate pipelines traditional role of providing the sale and transportation of natural gas as a single service has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas 
although the ferc s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers  they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
in  the ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders  which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets 
among other things  order no 
revised the ferc s pricing policy by waiving price ceilings for short term released capacity for a two year experimental period  and effected changes in ferc regulations relating to scheduling procedures  capacity segmentation  penalties  rights of first refusal and information reporting 

table of contents the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated 
therefore  we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by the ferc under order no 
will continue 
however  we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers 
the price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and  for the most part  is not subject to state regulation 
however  with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities  we are required to observe anti market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the ferc and or the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the federal trade commission ftc 
please see below the discussion of other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry energy policy act of should we violate the anti market manipulation laws and regulations  we could also be subject to related third party damage claims by  among others  sellers  royalty owners and taxing authorities 
in addition  pursuant to order no 
 some of our operations may be required to annually report to ferc on may of each year for the previous calendar year 
order no 
requires certain natural gas market participants to report information regarding their reporting of transactions to price index publishers and their blanket sales certificate status  as well as certain information regarding their wholesale  physical natural gas transactions for the previous calendar year depending on the volume of natural gas transacted 
please see below the discussion of other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry ferc market transparency rules 
gathering services  which occur upstream of ferc jurisdictional transmission services  are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters 
although the ferc has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function  the ferc s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case by case basis 
state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements 
although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future 
intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies  and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by ferc 
the basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state 
insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis  we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors 
like the regulation of interstate transportation rates  the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas 
regulation of production the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local  state and federal statutes  rules  orders and regulations 
federal  state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
all of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  the regulation of well spacing  and plugging and abandonment of wells 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill  although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
the failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations 
other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry energy policy act of on august   president bush signed into law the energy policy act of epact 
epact is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives  authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry 
among other matters  epact amends the nga to add an anti manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by ferc  and furthermore provides ferc with additional civil penalty authority 
epact provides the ferc with the power to assess civil penalties of up to million per day for violations of the nga and increases the ferc s civil penalty authority under the ngpa from  per violation per day to million per violation per day 
the civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce 
on january   ferc issued order no 
 a rule implementing the anti manipulation provision of epact  and subsequently denied rehearing 
the rule makes it unlawful for any entity  directly or indirectly  in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of ferc  or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of ferc  to use or employ any device  scheme or artifice to defraud  make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading  or engage in any act  practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person 
the new anti manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non jurisdictional sales or gathering  but do apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services  such as section service  as well as otherwise non jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted in connection with gas sales  purchases or transportation subject to ferc jurisdiction  which now includes the annual reporting requirements under order no 
the anti manipulation rules and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of ferc s nga enforcement authority 
should we fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes  rules  regulations and orders  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 

table of contents ferc market transparency rules 
on december   ferc issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements  as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing  or order no 
under order no 
 wholesale buyers and sellers of more than million mmbtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year  including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines  natural gas gatherers  natural gas processors  natural gas marketers and natural gas producers  are required to report  on may of each year  aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize  contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices 
it is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of order no 
order no 
also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and  if so  whether their reporting complies with ferc s policy statement on price reporting 
effective november   pursuant to the energy independence and security act of  the ftc issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation in the petroleum industry 
the ftc rule prohibits any person  directly or indirectly  in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil  gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale from a knowingly engaging in any act  practice or course of business  including the making of any untrue statement of material fact  that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person  or b intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading  provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product 
a violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to million per day per violation  in addition to any applicable penalty under the federal trade commission act 
north dakota industrial commission oil and gas rule changes 
the north dakota industrial commission has adopted more stringent rule changes to its existing oil and gas regulations 
the rules became effective on april  and  among other things  impose relatively higher bonding amounts for the drilling of wells  severely restrict the discharge and storage of production wastes such as produced water  drilling mud  waste oil and other wastes in earthen pits  implement more stringent hydraulic fracturing requirements and require the provision of public disclosure on the national website  fracfocus 
org  regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
compliance with these recent rule changes by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators in general and us in particular increased our well costs during  and we expect to continue to incur these increased costs in order to remain in compliance 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  ferc and the courts 
we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations 
we do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors 
environmental and occupational health and safety regulation our exploration  development and production operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal  regional  state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety  the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may  among other things  require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration  drilling and production operations  govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment  limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands  wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered species  require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions  impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits  and impose specific criteria addressing worker protection 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas 
these laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability 
the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  any changes in federal or state environmental laws and regulations or reinterpretation of applicable enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly well construction  drilling  water management or completion activities  or waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 
we may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers 
moreover  accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations  and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills  including any third party claims for damage to property  natural resources or persons 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future with such existing or any new laws and regulations or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

table of contents the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures  results of operations or financial position 
hazardous substances and wastes the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these classes of persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  these responsible persons may be subject to joint and several  strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
cercla also authorizes the us environmental protection agency epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances 
we are also subject to the requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state statutes 
rcra imposes strict requirements on the generation  storage  treatment  transportation  disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes 
under the authority of the epa  most states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra  sometimes in conjunction with their own  more stringent requirements 
rcra currently exempts certain drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes 
these wastes  instead  are regulated under rcra s less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions  state laws or other federal laws 
however  it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration  development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future 
repeal or modification of this rcra exclusion or similar exemptions under state law could increase the amount of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and could cause us to incur increased operating costs  which could have a significant impact on us as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general 
in addition  in the course of our operations  we generate ordinary industrial wastes  such as paint wastes  waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes 
we currently own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce oil and natural gas 
although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  petroleum hydrocarbons  hazardous substances and wastes may have been released on  under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on  under or from  other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal 
in addition  certain of these properties have been operated by the third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons  hazardous substances and wastes were not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater and to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
air emissions the federal clean air act  as amended caa  and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of various air pollutants from many sources through air emissions standards  construction and operating permitting programs  and the imposition of other monitoring and reporting requirements 
these laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions  obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants 
obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 
over the next several years  we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues 
for example  on august   the epa published final rules under the caa that subject oil and natural gas production  processing  transmission and storage operations to regulation under the new source performance standards  or nsps  and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants  or neshap  programs 
with regards to production activities  these final rules require  among other things  the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted wildcat exploratory and delineation gas wells  low reservoir pressure non wildcat and non delineation gas wells  and all other fractured and refractured gas wells 
all three subcategories of wells must route flow back emissions to a gathering line or be captured and combusted using a combustion device such as a flare after october  however  the other wells must use reduced emission completions  also known as green completions  with or without combustion devices  after january  these regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production related wet seal and reciprocating compressors  effective october  and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels  effective october  we continually review new rules such as these to assess their impact on our operations 
compliance with new requirements could increase our costs of development and production  which costs could be significant 

table of contents climate change based on findings made by the epa in december that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases ghg present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes  the epa adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that establish prevention of significant deterioration psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are potential major sources of ghg emissions 
facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards  which will be established by the states or  in some instances  by the epa on a case by case basis 
these epa rules could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities 
the epa has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified sources in the united states  including  among others  certain oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis  which include certain of our operations 
we are monitoring ghg emissions from our operations in accordance with the ghg emissions reporting rule and believe that our monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations 
while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs  there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce ghg emissions at the federal level in recent years 
in the absence of such federal climate legislation  a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and or reducing ghg emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions  such as electric power plants  to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs 
if congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year  it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax  which could impose additional direct costs on operations and reduce demand for refined products 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghgs from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations 
water discharges the federal water pollution control act  as amended the clean water act  and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters and waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the analogous state agency 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill  rupture or leak 
in addition  the clean water act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities 
the clean water act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters  including wetlands  unless authorized by permit 
the oil pollution act of  as amended opa  amends the clean water act  and sets minimum standards for prevention  containment and cleanup of oil spills 
the opa applies to vessels  offshore facilities and onshore facilities  including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the united states 
under opa  responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills 
the opa also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare facility response plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil into waters of the united states 
operations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds  produced waters and other waste streams  some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non producing subsurface formations 
recent north dakota industrial commission rule changes effective april  severely restrict the discharge and storage of production wastes including produced water in earthen pits  which increases the likelihood that injection wells are used to dispose of appropriate waste streams 
these injection wells are regulated by the federal safe drinking water act and analogous state laws 
the underground injection well program under the safe drinking water act requires permits from the epa or analogous state agency for disposal wells that we operate  establishes minimum standards for injection well operations and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable disposal well requirements  any changes in the laws or regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and ultimately increase the cost of our operations  which costs could be significant 

table of contents hydraulic fracturing activities hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from unconventional formations  including shales 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
we routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions  but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuels and published draft permitting guidance in may addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels 
in november  the epa announced its intent to develop and issue regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and the agency currently plans to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that would seek public input on the design and scope of such disclosure regulations 
in addition  congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting  public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities 
local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time  place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular 
we believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities 
nevertheless  if new or more stringent federal  state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate  we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements  experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration  development  or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells 
in addition  certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater  with a first progress report outlining work currently underway by the agency released on december  and a final report drawing conclusions about the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources expected to be available for public comment and peer review by moreover  the epa has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities by other governmental agencies  including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior  have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal safe drinking water act or other regulatory mechanisms 
to our knowledge  there have been no citations  suits  or contamination of potable drinking water arising from our fracturing operations 
we do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations  however  we believe our general liability and excess liability insurance policies would generally cover third party claims directly related to hydraulic fracturing operations conducted by third parties and associated legal expenses in accordance with  and subject to  the terms of such policies 
however  certain long term pollution and environmental risks are not fully insurable 
please see item a 
risk factors we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations 
additionally  we may not be insured for  or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against  these risks 
endangered species act considerations the federal endangered species act  as amended esa  may restrict exploration  development and production activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats 
the esa provides broad protection for species of fish  wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the united states and prohibits the taking of endangered species 
federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized  funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitats 
while some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa 
if endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct seismic surveys  development activities or abandonment operations  such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required 
moreover  as a result of a settlement approved by the us district court for the district of columbia in september  the us fish and wildlife service is required to make a determination on a listing of more than species as endangered or threatened under the esa by no later than completion of the agency s fiscal year 
the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves 

table of contents operations on federal lands performance of oil and gas exploration and production activities on federal lands  including indian lands and lands administered by the federal bureau of land management blm are subject to the national environmental policy act  as amended nepa 
nepa requires federal agencies  including the blm and the federal bureau of indian affairs  to evaluate major agency actions  such as the issuance of permits that have the potential to significantly impact the environment 
in the course of such evaluations  an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct  indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and  if necessary  will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment 
depending on any mitigation strategies recommended in such environmental assessments or environmental impact statements  we could incur added costs  which could be substantial  and be subject to delays or limitations in the scope of oil and natural gas projects 
employee health and safety we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations  including the federal occupational safety and health act  as amended osha  and comparable state statutes  whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
employees as of december   we employed people 
our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business involves a high degree of risk 
if any of the following risks  or any risk described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us 
risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business a substantial or extended decline in oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments 
the price we receive for our oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas  heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile 
these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production  and the levels of our production  depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include the following worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas  the actions of opec  the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas  political conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries  including the current conflicts in the middle east and conditions in south america  china  india and russia  the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production  the level of global oil and natural gas inventories  localized supply and demand fundamentals and regional  domestic and international transportation availability  weather conditions and natural disasters  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts  price and availability of competitors supplies of oil and natural gas  technological advances affecting energy consumption  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
substantially all of our production is sold to purchasers under short term less than twelve month contracts at market based prices 
lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows  borrowing ability and the present value of our reserves 
see our exploration  development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures 
we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to expiration of our leases or a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
lower oil and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and may affect our proved reserves 
see also the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves below 
drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation  exploration  development and production activities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control  including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit drilling locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes  see our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves below 
our cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
further  many factors may curtail  delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects  including the following 
table of contents shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  facility or equipment malfunctions and or failure  unexpected operational events  including accidents  pressure or irregularities in geological formations  adverse weather conditions  such as blizzards  ice storms and floods  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements  proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities  title problems  and limitations in the market for oil and natural gas 
our estimated net proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this annual report on form k 
see item business our operations for information about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves and the pv and standardized measure of discounted future net revenues as of december   and in order to prepare our estimates  we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
although the reserve information contained herein is reviewed by our independent reserve engineers  estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this annual report on form k 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of net proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the limited production history of our undeveloped acreage  the estimates of future production associated with such properties may be subject to greater variance to actual production than would be the case with properties having a longer production history 
the present value of future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated net oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements for the years ended december   and  we based the estimated discounted future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions 
actual future net revenues from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas  actual cost of development and production expenditures  the amount and timing of actual production  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 

table of contents the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from estimated net proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this annual report on form k 
any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our estimated net proved reserves 
the unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis 
shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques 
the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to drilling and completion technique risks and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 
as a result  we may incur material write downs and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful 
operations in the bakken and the three forks formations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers in order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns 
risks that we face while drilling include  but are not limited to  landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone  staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation  running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore 
risks that we face while completing our wells include  but are not limited to  being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages  being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage 
our experience with horizontal drilling utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques specifically in the bakken and three forks formations is limited 
ultimately  the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period 
if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints  lease expirations  access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity or otherwise  and or natural gas and oil prices decline  the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate 
we could incur material write downs of unevaluated properties  and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 
our exploration  development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures 
we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to expiration of our leases or a decline in our estimated net oil and natural gas reserves 
our exploration and development activities are capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development  exploitation  production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
we spent  million and million related to capital expenditures for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditure budget for is approximately  million  with approximately million allocated for drilling and completion operations 
since our ipo  our capital expenditures have been financed with proceeds from our ipo  net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from our billion of senior unsecured notes 
degolyer and macnaughton projects that we will incur capital costs including abandonment obligations in excess of  million over the next four years to develop the proved undeveloped reserves in the williston basin covered by its december  reserve report 
because these costs cover less than of our net primary drilling locations  we will be required to generate or raise multiples of this amount of capital to develop all of our potential drilling locations should we elect to do so 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of  among other things  commodity prices  actual drilling results  the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment  and regulatory  technological and competitive developments 
a significant improvement in product prices could result in an increase in our capital expenditures 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily through net proceeds from our previous issuances of senior unsecured notes  cash flows provided by operating activities  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  however  our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities or the sale of non strategic assets 
the issuance of additional debt or equity may require that a portion of our cash flows provided by operating activities be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock 
in addition  upon the issuance of certain debt securities other than on a borrowing base redetermination date  our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility will be automatically reduced by an amount equal to of the aggregate principal amount of such debt securities 

table of contents our cash flows provided by operating activities and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our estimated net proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells and new projected wells  the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold  the costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas production  our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves  the ability and willingness of our banks to lend  and our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets 
if the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility or our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
if additional capital is needed  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if cash generated by operations or cash available under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our drilling locations  which in turn could lead to a possible expiration of our leases and a decline in our estimated net proved reserves  and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if oil and natural gas prices decrease  we may be required to take write downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties 
we review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred 
based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews  and the continuing evaluation of development plans  production data  economics and other factors  we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties  which may result in a decrease in the amount available under our revolving credit facility 
a write down constitutes a non cash charge to earnings 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken 
no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended december   and we will not be the operator on all of our drilling locations  and  therefore  we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts  associated costs  or the rate of production of any non operated assets 
we expect that we will not be the operator on approximately of our identified gross drilling locations approximately of our identified net drilling locations 
as we carry out our exploration and development programs  we may enter into arrangements with respect to existing or future drilling locations that result in a greater proportion of our locations being operated by others 
as a result  we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling locations operated by our partners 
dependence on the operator could prevent us from realizing our target returns for those locations 
the success and timing of exploration and development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control  including the timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells  selection of technology  and the rate of production of reserves  if any 
this limited ability to exercise control over the operations of some of our drilling locations may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents all of our producing properties and operations are located in the williston basin region  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area 
as of december   of our proved reserves and production were located in the williston basin in northeastern montana and northwestern north dakota 
as a result  we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these wells caused by transportation capacity constraints  curtailment of production  availability of equipment  facilities  personnel or services  significant governmental regulation  natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in this area 
in addition  the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the williston basin  which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions 
due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties  a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time  resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties 
such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on oil and natural gas gathering and transportation facilities  most of which are owned by third parties 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability  proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems owned by third parties 
the unavailability of  or lack of  available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay  or discontinuance of  development plans for properties 
see also market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production and insufficient transportation or refining capacity in the williston basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices 
we generally do not purchase firm transportation on third party pipeline facilities  and therefore  the transportation of our production can be interrupted by other customers that have firm arrangements 
the disruption of third party facilities due to maintenance  weather or other interruptions of service could also negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products 
we have no control over when or if such facilities are restored 
a total shut in of our production could materially affect us due to a resulting lack of cash flow  and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than market prices  those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent sufficient cash flow 
insufficient transportation or refining capacity in the williston basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices 
the williston basin crude oil business environment has historically been characterized by periods when oil production has surpassed local transportation and refining capacity  resulting in substantial discounts in the price received for crude oil versus prices quoted for wti crude oil 
although additional williston basin transportation takeaway capacity was added in and  production also increased due to the elevated drilling activity in these years 
the increased production coupled with delays in rail car arrivals and commissioning of rail loading facilities caused price differentials at times to be at the high end of the historical average range of approximately to of the wti crude oil index price in the first half of during the second half of  differentials improved due to expanding rail infrastructure and pipeline expansions coming online 
on barrels that are transported over pipelines to either clearbrook  minnesota or guernsey  wyoming  our realized price for crude oil is generally the quoted price for bakken crude oil less transportation costs from the point where the crude oil is sold 
the development of our proved undeveloped reserves in the williston basin and other areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
therefore  our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced 
approximately of our estimated net proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped as of december  development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the pv value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic 
in addition  delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves 
unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unless we conduct successful development  exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  our estimated net proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced 
producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flows and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  exploit  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs 
if we are unable to replace our current and future production  the value of our reserves will decrease  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends  in substantial part  on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 
we may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines or gathering system capacity 
if our production becomes shut in for any of these or other reasons  we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements were made to deliver the products to market 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations 
additionally  we may not be insured for  or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against  these risks 
we are not insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including the possibility of environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline and tank ruptures  encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized discharges of brine  well stimulation and completion fluids  toxic gas or other pollutants into the environment  abnormally pressured formations  shortages of  or delays in  obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing failure  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of injury or loss of life  damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repair and remediation costs 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred losses in prior years and may do so again in the future 
for the years ended december  and  we had net income of million and million  respectively 
however  for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million 
our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures  including planned capital expenditures for of approximately  million 
the uncertainty and risks described in this annual report on form k may impede our ability to economically find  develop  exploit and acquire oil and natural gas reserves 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future 
drilling locations that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 
we describe some of our drilling locations and our plans to explore those drilling locations in this annual report on form k 
our drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation  ranging from a location which is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional interpretation 
there is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable 
the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or  if present  whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable 
even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist  we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well  resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well 
if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations  our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business 
we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations 
further  initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the williston basin may not be indicative of future or long term production rates 
in sum  the cost of drilling  completing and operating any well is often uncertain  and new wells may not be productive 

table of contents our potential drilling location inventories are scheduled to be drilled over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 
in addition  we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our potential drilling locations 
our management has identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi year drilling activities on our existing acreage 
these potential drilling locations  including those without proved undeveloped reserves  represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties  including the availability of capital  seasonal conditions  regulatory approvals  oil and natural gas prices  costs and drilling results 
because of these uncertainties  we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations 
pursuant to existing sec rules and guidance  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
these rules and guidance may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program 
our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration  generally within three to five years  in order to hold the acreage by production 
in the highly competitive market for acreage  failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in a substantial lease renewal cost  or if renewal is not feasible  loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 
unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified  the leases for such acreage will expire 
as of december   we had leases representing  net acres expiring in   net acres expiring in and  net acres expiring in the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly  and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  on certain portions of our acreage  third party leases become immediately effective if our leases expire 
as such  our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations  which could adversely affect our business 
during each of the years ended december  and  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million  and during the year ended december   we recorded non cash impairment charges of million on our unproved properties due to expiring leases and periodic assessments of our unproved properties 
our operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal  regional  state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety aspects of our operations  the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling or underground injection activities  the restriction of types  quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment  the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection  and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations 
numerous governmental authorities  such as the epa  and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes  because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  we could be subject to joint and several  strict liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
private parties  including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal  may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage 
in addition  the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of well drilling  construction  completion on water management activities or operations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
we may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance 

table of contents failure to comply with federal  state and local laws could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and transport our oil and natural gas and may result in substantial penalties 
our operations are substantially affected by federal  state and local laws and regulations  particularly as they relate to the regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation 
these laws and regulations include regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production and related operations  including a variety of activities related to the drilling of wells  the interstate transportation of oil and natural gas by federal agencies such as the ferc  as well as state agencies 
in addition  federal laws prohibit market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of oil and or natural gas 
failure to comply with federal  state and local laws could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and transport our oil and natural gas and may result in substantial penalties 
please see other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry 
climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives restricting emissions of ghgs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
based on findings by the epa in december that emissions of ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes  the epa adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that establish prevention of significant deterioration psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are potential major sources of ghg emissions 
facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that will be established by the states or  in some cases  by the epa on a case by case basis 
these epa rules could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities 
the epa has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified sources in the united states  including  among others  certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis  which includes certain of our operations 
while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs  there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce ghg emissions at the federal level in recent years 
in the absence of such federal climate legislation  a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and or reducing ghg emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions  such as electric power plants  to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs 
if congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year  it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax  which could impose additional direct costs on operations and reduce demand for refined products 
the adoption and implementation of any legislation or regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghgs from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations 
federal  state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and or oil from dense subsurface rock formations 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into the targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
we routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions  but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuels and published draft permitting guidance in may addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels 
in november  the epa announced its intent to develop and issue regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and the agency currently plans to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that would seek public input on the design and scope of such disclosure regulations 
in addition  congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
at the state level  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting  public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities 
local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time  place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular 
if new or more stringent federal  state  or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate  we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements  experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration  development  or production activities  and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells 

table of contents in addition  certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater  with a first progress report outlining work currently underway by the agency released on december  and a final report drawing conclusions about the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources expected to be available for public comment and peer review by moreover  the epa has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities by other governmental agencies  including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior  have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal safe drinking water act or other regulatory mechanisms 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  making it more difficult for us to acquire properties  market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel 
our ability to acquire additional drilling locations and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
many of our competitors possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours 
those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory drilling locations or to identify  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or personnel resources permit 
furthermore  these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of unsuccessful drilling attempts  sustained periods of volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry wide economic conditions  and may be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 
the cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 
to a large extent  we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel  including thomas b 
nusz  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and taylor l 
reid  our executive vice president and chief operating officer  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not maintain  nor do we plan to obtain  any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals 
seasonal weather conditions adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 
oil and natural gas operations in the williston basin are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions 
in the williston basin  drilling and other oil and natural gas activities cannot be conducted as effectively during the winter months 
severe winter weather conditions limit and may temporarily halt our ability to operate during such conditions 
these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 
our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income 
to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  we currently  and may in the future  enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production  including collars and fixed price swaps 
we have not designated any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and record all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings 
accordingly  our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments 
derivative arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments  the counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations  or there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual price received 

table of contents in addition  some of these types of derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements 
the enactment of derivatives legislation and regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the negative effect of commodity price changes  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 
on july   new comprehensive financial reform legislation  known as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities  such as us  that participate in that market 
the dodd frank act requires the cftc  the sec and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation 
in its rulemaking under the dodd frank act  the cftc has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents 
certain bona fide hedging transactions would be exempt from these position limits 
the position limits rule was vacated by the united states district court for the district of columbia in september of  although the cftc has stated that it will appeal the district court s decision 
the cftc also has finalized other regulations  including critical rulemakings on the definition of swap  security based swap  swap dealer and major swap participant 
the dodd frank act and cftc rules also will require us in connection with certain derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements 
in addition  new regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements although these regulations are not finalized and their application to us is uncertain at this time 
other regulations also remain to be finalized  and the cftc recently has delayed the compliance dates for various regulations already finalized 
as a result  it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the dodd frank act and cftc rules on us and the timing of such effects 
the dodd frank act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties 
the dodd frank act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements and through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the dodd frank act and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
finally  the dodd frank act was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the dodd frank act is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business 
our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability  terms and cost of capital  increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating 
changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase  limit our access to capital  limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities  reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations 
we require continued access to capital 
a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results 
we may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations 
we expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to the nature of our industry 
as a result  the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods 
additionally  our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and other commitments 
any insufficiency could negatively impact our business 
a range of economic  competitive  business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance  and  as a result  our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt obligations 
many of these factors  such as oil and natural gas prices  economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy and initiatives of our competitors  are beyond our control 
if we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments  seeking to raise additional capital  or refinancing or restructuring our debt 

table of contents if for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations  we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt  which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable  which would in turn trigger cross acceleration or cross default rights between the relevant agreements 
in addition  our lenders could compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings or they could prevent us from making payments on our senior unsecured notes 
if amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our senior unsecured notes were to be accelerated  we cannot be certain that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders 
please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes all contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities 
our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to  among other things sell assets  including equity interests in our subsidiaries  pay distributions on  redeem or repurchase our common stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt  make investments  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  create or incur certain liens  make certain acquisitions and investments  redeem or prepay other debt  enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  create unrestricted subsidiaries  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and engage in certain business activities 
as a result of these covenants  we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business  and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs 
our ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes may be affected by events beyond our control 
if market or other economic conditions deteriorate  our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired 
a failure to comply with the covenants  ratios or tests in our revolving credit facility  the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our revolving credit facility  the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes or our future indebtedness  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if an event of default under our revolving credit facility occurs and remains uncured  the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us  could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees  to be due and payable  may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings  or may prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements 
a payment default or an acceleration under our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default and an acceleration under the indentures for our senior unsecured notes 
if the indebtedness under the notes were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that we would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness in full 
in addition  our obligations under our revolving credit facility are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets  including mortgage liens on oil and natural gas properties having at least of the reserve value as determined by reserve reports  and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets

in the future  we may incur significant indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties 
our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways  including the following a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness  a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness limit our ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  pay dividends and make certain investments  our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in the economy and in our industry  a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore  may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing  a high level of debt may make it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then outstanding bank borrowings  and a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes 
a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance 
general economic conditions  oil and natural gas prices and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital  and borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions  the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 
in addition  our bank borrowing base is subject to periodic redeterminations 
we could be forced to repay a portion of our bank borrowings due to redeterminations of our borrowing base 
if we are forced to do so  we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments 
if we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing  we may have to sell significant assets 
any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results 
our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our oil and natural gas production million in receivables at december   which we market to energy marketing companies  refineries and affiliates  advances to joint interest parties million at december  and joint interest receivables million at december  
we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers 
this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk since these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
for the year ended december   sales to musket corporation accounted for approximately of our total sales 
for the year ended december   sales to texon lp  plains all american pipeline  lp and enserco energy inc accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total sales 
for the year ended december   sales to plains all american pipeline  lp  texon lp and whiting petroleum corporation accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total sales 
no other purchasers accounted for more than of our total oil and natural gas sales for the years ended december   and we do not require all of our customers to post collateral 
the inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results 

table of contents joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own a partial interest in the wells we operate 
these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we choose to drill 
we have limited ability to control participation in our wells 
in addition  our oil and natural gas derivative arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
we may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult 
we periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves  properties  prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials  development and operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as  for example  groundwater contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis 
significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks  including diversion of our management s attention to evaluating  negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions  the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations  information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business  difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations  and the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our business 
members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process  which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business 
if our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process  or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process  our business could suffer 
if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a significant acquisition  our results of operations may be lower than we expect 
the success of a significant acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities from combining the acquired assets or operations with those of ours 
even if a combination is successful  it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated net proved reserves  production volume  cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame 
anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices  or in oil and natural gas industry conditions  or by risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the combined assets or operations  or an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties 
if we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 
it is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest 
rather  we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest 
prior to the drilling of an oil or gas well  however  it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in the title to the well 
frequently  as a result of such examinations  certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title  and such curative work entails expense 
our failure to cure any title defects may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves 
there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure 
additionally  undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage 
if there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest  we will suffer a financial loss 

table of contents certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation 
president obama s budget proposal for fiscal year recommended the elimination of certain key united states federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for united states production activities for oil and gas production  and iv the extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether any such changes or similar changes will be enacted or  if enacted  how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in us federal income tax law could affect certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and production 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

additionally  we are currently prohibited from making any cash dividends pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  as well as delaware law  contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders  including a classified board of directors  so that only approximately one third of our directors are elected each year  limitations on the removal of directors  and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders 
delaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder  meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder  unless various conditions are met  such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors

the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
we caution that assumptions  expectations  projections  intentions  or beliefs about future events may  and often do  vary from actual results and the differences can be material 
some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from our expectations include changes in oil and natural gas prices  the timing of planned capital expenditures  availability of acquisitions  uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results  operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells  the condition of the capital markets generally  as well as our ability to access them  the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities  and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources primarily in the montana and north dakota regions of the williston basin 
since our inception  we have acquired properties that provide current production and significant upside potential through further development 
our drilling activity is primarily directed toward projects that we believe can provide us with repeatable successes in the bakken and three forks formations 
we also operate a marketing business  opm  that is complementary to our primary development and production activities  and a well services business  ows  which is a separate reportable business segment 
the revenues and expenses related to work performed by opm and ows for opna s working interests are eliminated in consolidation and  therefore  do not directly contribute to our consolidated results of operations 
our use of capital for development and acquisitions allows us to direct our capital resources to what we believe to be the most attractive opportunities as market conditions evolve 
we have historically acquired properties that we believe will meet or exceed our rate of return criteria 
for acquisitions of properties with additional development  exploitation and exploration potential  we have focused on acquiring properties that we expect to operate so that we can control the timing and implementation of capital spending 
in some instances  we have acquired non operated property interests at what we believe to be attractive rates of return either because they provided a foothold in a new area of interest or complemented our existing operations 
we intend to continue to acquire both operated and non operated properties to the extent we believe they meet our return objectives 
in addition  our willingness to acquire non operated properties in new areas provides us with geophysical and geologic data that may lead to further acquisitions in the same area  whether on an operated or non operated basis 
we built our williston basin leasehold acreage position in our west williston  east nesson and sanish project areas through acquisitions and development activities 
these acquisitions and development activities were financed with a combination of capital from private and public investors  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  cash flows provided by operating activities and proceeds from our senior unsecured notes 
our  and activities included development and exploration drilling in each of our primary project areas 
our current activities are focused on evaluating and developing our asset base  optimizing our acreage positions and evaluating potential acquisitions 
based on the reserve reports prepared by our independent reserve engineers  we had mmboe of estimated net proved reserves with a pv of  million and a standardized measure of  million at december   mmboe of estimated net proved reserves with a pv of  million and a standardized measure of  million at december  and mmboe of estimated net proved reserves with a pv of million and a standardized measure of million at december  our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues  pv and standardized measure were determined using index prices for oil and natural gas  without giving effect to derivative transactions  and were held constant throughout the life of the properties 
the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months were bbl for oil and mmbtu for natural gas  bbl for oil and mmbtu for natural gas  and bbl for oil and mmbtu for natural gas for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these prices were adjusted by lease for quality  transportation fees  geographical differentials  marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 
due to the geographic concentration of our oil and natural gas properties in the williston basin  we believe the primary sources of opportunities  challenges and risks related to our business for both the short and long term are commodity prices for oil and natural gas  transportation capacity  
table of contents availability and cost of services  and availability of qualified personnel 
our revenue  profitability and future growth rate depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments as well as competition from other sources of energy 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital 
prices for oil and natural gas can fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the global and regional supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  as well as market uncertainty  economic conditions and a variety of additional factors 
since the inception of our oil and natural gas activities  commodity prices have experienced significant fluctuations 
we enter into crude oil sales contracts with purchasers who have access to crude oil transportation capacity  utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our commodity price risk and enter into physical delivery contracts to manage our price differentials 
in an effort to improve price realizations from the sale of our oil and natural gas  we manage our commodities marketing activities in house  which enables us to market and sell our oil and natural gas to a broader array of potential purchasers 
due to the availability of other markets and pipeline connections  we do not believe that the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
please see item business marketing  transportation and major customers 
our quarterly average net realized oil prices and average price differentials are shown in the table below 
year ended december year ended december year ended december q q q q q q q q q q q q average realized oil prices bbl average price differential realized oil prices do not include the effect of realized derivative contract settlements 
price differential compares realized oil prices to wti crude oil index prices 
changes in commodity prices may also significantly affect the economic viability of drilling projects as well as the economic valuation and economic recovery of oil and gas reserves 
oil prices have increased significantly since the higher commodity prices  as well as continued successes in the application of completion technologies in the bakken formation  caused the active drilling rig count in the williston basin to increase to approximately rigs at december  although additional williston basin transportation takeaway capacity was added in recent years  production also increased due to the elevated drilling activity 
the increased production coupled with delays in rail car arrivals and commissioning of rail loading facilities caused price differentials at times to be at the high end of the historical average range of approximately to of the wti crude oil index price in the first half of in the third quarter of  differentials began to narrow  primarily due to transportation capacity additions  including expanded rail infrastructure and pipeline expansions  outpacing production growth 
in the fourth quarter of  these price differentials continued to narrow  and at some points crude oil produced in the williston basin sold at a premium to wti crude oil index prices as a result of additional transportation capacity additions which had access to the east and west coast refineries 
our large concentrated acreage position potentially provides us with a multi year inventory of drilling projects and requires some forward planning visibility for obtaining services 
our ability to develop and hold our existing undeveloped leasehold acreage is primarily dependent upon having access to drilling rigs and completion services 
to ensure access to drilling rigs  we have entered into fixed term drilling rig contracts for periods of up to three years and currently have nine drilling rigs under contract 
in order to ensure the availability of completion services and the timely fracture stimulation of newly drilled wells  we formed ows in june to provide well services on our operated wells  in addition to entering into fracturing service contracts with third party companies 
highlights we completed and placed on production gross net operated bakken and three forks wells during  and increased average daily production by to  boe per day from  boe per day in we increased estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves at december  to mmboe  an increase over year end estimated net proved reserves 
approximately of estimated net proved reserves at year end consisted of oil and were classified as proved developed 

table of contents we grew our leasehold position to  total net acres in the williston basin  primarily targeting the bakken and three forks formations  and increased our operated drill blocks by through acreage additions and trades during in addition  we have increased our acreage that is held by production to  net acres as of december  as of december   we had nine operated rigs running 
in  ows began providing well services to opna  and we had three fracturing services crews  including ows  working full time as of december  in  opm became the first purchaser for the majority of our operated oil volumes and provided downstream gathering  transportation and marketing services to opna 
in  we began selling a significant amount of our crude oil production from our west williston project area through gathering systems connected to multiple pipeline and rail facilities 
these gathering systems  which originate at the wellhead  reduce the need to transport barrels by truck from the wellhead 
as of december   we flowed approximately of our gross operated oil production through these gathering systems 
we expect to increase the gross operated oil production that will flow on these systems to over by mid year with the implementation of gathering connections in our east nesson project area 
in  we entered into new two way and three way collar options  swaps and put spreads  all of which settle monthly based on the wti crude oil index price 
as of december   we had a total notional amount of  barrels that settle in   barrels that settle in and  barrels that settle in on july   we issued million of senior unsecured notes due january  the issuance of these notes resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million  which we continue to use to fund our exploration  development and acquisition program and for general corporate purposes 
on october   we entered into our seventh amendment to our revolving credit facility 
in connection with this amendment  the semi annual redetermination of our borrowing base was completed  which resulted in an increase to the borrowing base of our revolving credit facility from million to million 
however  we elected to have the lenders aggregate commitment remain at million  which we may increase in the future to million by increasing the commitment of one or more lender s 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we had no outstanding borrowings and had million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 
our capital expenditure budget is  million  an decrease from our capital expenditures of  million 
the budget consists of million of drilling and completion capital for operated and non operated wells including expected savings from services provided by ows  million for constructing infrastructure to support production in our core project areas  primarily related to salt water disposal systems  million for maintaining and expanding our leasehold position  million for micro seismic work  purchasing seismic data and other test work  million for facilities and other miscellaneous e p capital expenditures  million for ows  and million for other non e p capital  including items such as administrative capital and capitalized interest 
results of operations revenues our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production and well services and do not include the effects of derivatives 
our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices

year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenues 
our total revenues increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our exploration and production revenues are a function of oil and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes 
average daily production sold increased by  boe per day  or  to  boe per day during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in average daily production sold was primarily a result of a higher number of well completions during  offsetting the decline in production in wells that were producing as of december  production from wells completed in our west williston  east nesson and sanish project areas contributed to average daily production by approximately  boe per day   boe per day and boe per day  respectively  during average oil sales prices  without realized derivatives  decreased by bbl  or  to an average of bbl for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the higher production amounts sold increased revenues by million  while lower oil and natural gas sales prices decreased revenues by million 
well services revenues  which resulted from third party working interest owners in opna s wells  were million for the year ended december  there were no well services revenues during the year ended december  because ows did not commence fracturing activity until the first quarter of the remaining million increase in total revenues was attributable to oil bulk purchase revenues related to marketing activities included in oil and gas revenues during the year ended december  year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenues

stock based compensation expense related to the amortization of restricted stock and performance share units is included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the costs associated with operating an increased number of producing wells and associated produced fluid volumes as a result of our well completions 
increased costs primarily related to workovers  chemical treatments  equipment rental and fresh water injections  which have improved operational performance and minimized downtime in our wells 
these cost increases were partially offset by salt water disposal activity and lower operating costs related to improved weather conditions as compared to the first half of the unit operating costs decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to our increase in production of outpacing our overall net increase in costs of 
well services operating expenses 
the million in well services operating expenses represents third party working interests share of fracturing service costs incurred by ows for fracturing jobs completed in there were no well services operating expenses in because ows did not commence fracturing activity until the first quarter of 
table of contents marketing  transportation and gathering expenses 
marketing  transportation and gathering expenses includes all of our marketing  transportation and gathering for our oil production as well as bulk oil purchase costs 
the million increase period over period  or increase per boe  is primarily attributable to increased oil transportation costs related to opm  which did not commence operations until late in the third quarter of  combined with a million cost for bulk oil purchases made by opm in the first quarter of  partially offset by a million non cash valuation adjustment on our oil pipeline imbalances 
excluding this pipeline imbalance adjustment and bulk oil purchase costs  our marketing  transportation and gathering expenses on a per boe basis would have been for the year ended december  production taxes 
our production taxes for the years ended december  and were and  respectively  as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales 
the production tax rate was lower than the production tax rate because of the increased weighting of oil revenues in montana  which has lower incentivized production tax rates on certain new wells for the first twelve months of production 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in dd a expense for the year ended december  was primarily a result of our production increases from our well completions 
the dd a rate for the year ended december  was per boe compared to per boe for the year ended december  the higher dd a rate was a result of increased well costs in  which outpaced the increase in associated reserves 
the increased well costs were a result of increases in service costs in the williston basin during and the first half of and the addition of infrastructure assets  primarily our salt water disposal systems 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
no impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended december  and during the years ended december  and  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million each year for unproved properties due to leases that expired during the period and periodic assessments of unproved properties 
as of december   we recorded a million impairment charge related to acreage expiring in as a result of a periodic assessment because there were no plans to drill or extend the leases prior to their expiration 
in determining the amount of non cash impairment charges for such periods  we considered the application of the factors described under critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of proved properties and critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of unproved properties 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  approximately million was due to the impact of our organizational growth on employee compensation and million was due to the amortization of our restricted stock awards and performance share units psus 
as of december   we had full time employees compared to full time employees as of december  derivatives 
as a result of our derivative activities  we incurred a million net cash settlement gain for the year ended december  and a million net cash settlement loss for the year ended december  in addition  as a result of forward oil price changes  we recognized non cash unrealized mark to market derivative gains of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was due to the interest related to our senior unsecured notes issued in february and november and july for the years ended december  and  we incurred no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we capitalized million and million of interest costs for the years ended december  and  respectively  which will be amortized over the life of the related assets 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the years ended december  and was recorded at and of pre tax net income  respectively 
our effective tax rate is expected to continue to closely approximate the statutory rate applicable to the united states and the blended state rate of the states in which we conduct business 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increased number of producing wells from our west williston acquisitions that were completed in the fourth quarter of and to our well completions during the unit operating costs increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to increased costs associated with water production  salt water disposal and the continuing effects of the inclement weather during the first half of production taxes 
our production taxes for the years ended december  and were and  respectively  as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales 
the production tax rate was lower than the production tax rate because of the increased weighting of oil revenues in montana  which has lower incentivized production tax rates on certain new wells for the first twelve months of production 
our production taxes for the year ended december  were primarily for oil and natural gas sales revenue associated with properties in the north dakota portion of our west williston project area  which generate revenues subject to an production tax rate 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in dd a expense for the year ended december  was primarily a result of our production increases and well completions during the dd a rate for the year ended december  was per boe compared to per boe for the year ended december  the lower dd a rate was due to the lower cost of reserve additions associated with our drilling activities 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
no impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended december  and during the years ended december  and  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million and million  respectively  for unproved property leases that expired during the period 
in determining the amount of the non cash impairment charges for such periods  we considered the application of the factors described under critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of proved properties and critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of unproved properties 
as of december   we did not record an impairment charge with respect to any acreage expiring in based primarily on our ability to actively manage and prioritize our capital expenditures to drill leases and to make payments to extend leases that would otherwise expire 
stock based compensation expenses 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of primarily non cash charges for stock based compensation expense associated with oasis petroleum management llc s op management grant of c units to certain of our employees in march and grant of discretionary shares of our common stock to certain of our employees who were not c unit holders and certain contractors in the fourth quarter of based on the characteristics of these awards  we concluded that they represented equity type awards  and we accounted for the value of these awards as if they had been awarded by us 
we used fair value based methods to determine the value of stock based compensation awarded to our employees and contractors and recognized the entire amount as expense due to the immediate vesting of the awards  with no future requisite service period required by the employees 
as of december   op management had distributed substantially all cash or requisite common stock to its members based on membership interests and distribution percentages 
no stock based compensation expense was recorded for the year ended december  related to the c units or discretionary shares

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity as of the date of this report have been proceeds from our senior unsecured notes  cash flows from operations and historically  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capital from private and public investors 
our primary use of capital has been for the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
we continually monitor potential capital sources  including equity and debt financings  in order to meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity requirements 
our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on our ability to access outside sources of capital

we believe that the net proceeds from our senior unsecured notes together with cash on hand  cash flows from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility should be more than sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget 
however  because the operated wells funded by our drilling plan represent only a small percentage of our gross identified drilling locations  we will be required to generate or raise multiples of this amount of capital to develop our entire inventory of identified drilling locations should we elect to do so 
our capital budget may be adjusted as business conditions warrant 
the amount  timing and allocation of capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control 
if oil and natural gas prices decline or costs increase significantly  we could defer a significant portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods to prioritize capital projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and potential to generate near term cash flows 
we routinely monitor and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in prices  availability of financing  drilling and acquisition costs  industry conditions  the timing of regulatory approvals  the availability of rigs  success or lack of success in drilling activities  contractual obligations  internally generated cash flows and other factors both within and outside our control 
we actively review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis 
our ability to make significant acquisitions for cash would require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which we may not be able to obtain on terms acceptable to us or at all 
cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  cash sourced through financing activities was primarily provided by net proceeds from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes 
for the year ended december   cash sourced through financing activities was primarily provided by net proceeds from the sale of the common stock in our ipo 
sale of common stock

we sold  shares of common stock in the offering and oas holding company llc oas holdco  the selling stockholder  sold  shares of common stock  including  shares sold by oas holdco pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
we received net proceeds from the offering of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
we used a portion of these net proceeds to repay all outstanding indebtedness of million under our revolving credit facility  and the remaining proceeds were used to fund our exploration  development and acquisition program and for general corporate purposes 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by oas holdco

table of contents senior secured revolving line of credit 
op llc  as parent  and opna  as borrower  entered into a credit agreement dated june  as amended and restated  the amended credit facility 
the amended credit facility is restricted to the borrowing base  which is reserve based and subject to semi annual redeterminations on april and october of each year 
in connection with the sixth amendment  the semi annual redetermination of the borrowing base was completed on april   which resulted in the borrowing base of the amended credit facility increasing from million to million 
this amendment added two new lenders to the bank group 
effective april   we executed an agreement consenting to the resignation of bnp paribas as the administrative agent and a lender under the amended credit facility 
wells fargo was appointed successor administrative agent and assumed the credit commitment of bnp paribas 
bnp paribas remains as a counterparty for our commodity derivative instruments 
on june   our lenders waived the mandatory reduction of our borrowing base that otherwise would have occurred as a result of our issuance of the notes in july on october   we entered into the seventh amendment to our amended credit facility 
in connection with this amendment  the semi annual redetermination of our borrowing base was completed on october   which resulted in an increase to the borrowing base of our amended credit facility from million to million 
however  we elected to have the lenders aggregate commitment remain at million  but we may increase our aggregate commitment from million to million by increasing the commitment of one or more lender s 
borrowings under our amended credit facility are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets  including mortgage liens on oil and natural gas properties having at least of the reserve value as determined by reserve reports 
on a quarterly basis  we pay a as of december  annualized commitment fee on the average amount of borrowing base capacity not utilized during the quarter and fees calculated on the average amount of letter of credit balances outstanding during the quarter

amounts represent our estimate of future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including the rate of inflation  changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements below 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
under this method  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well does not find proved reserves  the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense 
the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive 
the provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties is calculated on a field by field basis using the unit of production method 
all capitalized well costs and leasehold costs of proved properties are amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and total proved reserves  respectively 
natural gas is converted to barrel equivalents at the rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil 
the calculation for the unit of production dd a method takes into consideration estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  which are net of estimated salvage values 
costs of retired  sold or abandoned properties that constitute a part of an amortization base partial field are charged or credited  net of proceeds  to accumulated dd a unless doing so significantly affects the unit of production amortization rate for an entire field  in which case a gain or loss is recognized currently 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and minor renewals necessary to maintain properties in operating condition are expensed as incurred 
major betterments  replacements and renewals are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts 
estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs for oil and natural gas properties are capitalized  net of salvage  at their estimated net present value and amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of the related proved developed reserves 
unproved properties consist of costs incurred to acquire unproved leases  or lease acquisition costs 
unproved lease acquisition costs are capitalized until the leases expire or when we specifically identify leases that will revert to the lessor  at which time we expense the associated unproved lease acquisition costs 
the expensing of the unproved lease acquisition costs is recorded as impairment expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
lease acquisition costs related to successful exploratory drilling are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unit of production basis 

table of contents for sales of entire working interests in unproved properties  gain or loss is recognized to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received and the net carrying value of the property 
proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved properties are accounted for as a recovery of costs unless the proceeds exceed the entire cost of the property 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue our independent reserve engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues 
while the sec rules allow us to disclose proved  probable and possible reserves  we have elected to disclose only proved reserves in this annual report on form k 
the sec s rules define proved reserves as the quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
our independent reserve engineers and technical staff must make a number of subjective assumptions based on their professional judgment in developing reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are updated annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field 
oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and related future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors  including reservoir performance  new drilling  oil and natural gas prices  cost changes  technological advances  new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
we cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions 
if such revisions are significant  they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 
revenue recognition oil and gas revenue from our interests in producing wells is recognized when the product is delivered  at which time the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  and collectability is reasonably assured 
substantially all of our production is sold to purchasers under short term less than twelve month contracts at market based prices 
the sales prices for oil and natural gas are adjusted for transportation and other related deductions 
these deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment 
subsequently  these revenue deductions are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third party documents 
since there is a ready market for oil and natural gas  we sell the majority of production soon after it is produced at various locations 
as a result  we maintain a minimum amount of product inventory in storage 
well services revenue is recognized when well completion services have been performed or related products have been delivered 
ows provides wells services and sells related products exclusively to opna 
the revenues related to opna s working interests are eliminated in consolidation  and only the revenues related to other working interest owners in opna s wells are included in our consolidated statement of operations 
impairment of proved properties we review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred 
we estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value are subject to our judgment and expertise and include  but are not limited to  recent sales prices of comparable properties  the present value of future cash flows  net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges for proved properties will be recorded 
impairment of unproved properties the assessment of unproved properties to determine any possible impairment requires significant judgment 
we assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property by property basis based on remaining lease terms  drilling results or future plans to develop acreage 

table of contents we have historically recognized impairment expense for unproved properties at the time when the lease term has expired or sooner based on management s periodic assessments 
we consider the following factors in our assessment of the impairment of unproved properties the remaining amount of unexpired term under our leases  our ability to actively manage and prioritize our capital expenditures to drill leases and to make payments to extend leases that may be close to expiration  our ability to exchange lease positions with other companies that allow for higher concentrations of ownership and development  our ability to convey partial mineral ownership to other companies in exchange for their drilling of leases  and our evaluation of the continuing successful results from the application of completion technology in the bakken and three forks formations by us or by other operators in areas adjacent to or near our unproved properties 
capitalized interest we capitalize a portion of our interest expense incurred on our outstanding debt 
the amount capitalized is determined by multiplying the capitalization rate by the average amount of eligible accumulated capital expenditures and is limited to actual interest costs incurred during the period 
the accumulated capital expenditures included in the capitalized interest calculation begin when the first costs are incurred and end when the asset is either placed into production or written off 
amounts capitalized are amortized over the life of the related assets 
asset retirement obligations we record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred with the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
for oil and gas properties  this is the period in which the well is drilled or acquired 
the asset retirement obligation aro represents the estimated amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate the properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is amortized on the unit of production method 
the accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation  depletion and amortization in our consolidated statement of operations 
we determine the aro by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to the liability 
estimating the future aro requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability  as well as what constitutes adequate restoration 
inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset 
cash equivalents and short term investments we invest in certain money market funds  commercial paper and time deposits  all of which are stated at fair value or cost which approximates fair value due to the short term maturity of these investments 
we classify all such investments with original maturity dates less than days as cash equivalents 
we classify all such investments with original maturity dates greater than days as held to maturity securities based on management s intentions to hold the investments to their maturity dates 
derivatives we record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their estimated fair value 
we have not designated any derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and we do not enter into such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
realized gains and losses from the settlement of commodity derivative instruments and unrealized gains and losses from valuation changes in the remaining unsettled commodity derivative instruments are reported under other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
our cash flow is only impacted when the actual settlements under the derivative contracts result in making or receiving a payment to or from the counterparty 
these cash settlements are reflected as investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
stock based compensation restricted stock awards 
we recognize compensation expense for all restricted stock awards made to employees and directors 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of restricted stock grants is based on the value of our common stock on the date of grant 
assumptions regarding forfeiture rates are subject to change 
any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized 
stock based compensation expense recorded for restricted stock awards is included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents performance share units 
we recognize compensation expense for our psus granted to our officers 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the performance period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of the psus is based on the calculation derived from a monte carlo simulation model 
the monte carlo simulation model uses assumptions regarding random projections and must be repeated numerous times to achieve a probable assessment 
any change in inputs or number of inputs to this calculation could impact the valuation and thus the stock based compensation expense recognized 
stock based compensation expense recorded for psus is included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of operations 
class c common unit interests 
in march  we recorded a million stock based compensation charge associated with op management granting million c units to certain of our employees 
the c units were granted on march  to individuals who were employed as of february  and who were not executive officers or key employees with an existing capital investment in op management  or op management capital members 
all of the c units vested immediately on the grant date 
based on the characteristics of the c units awarded to employees  we concluded that the c units represented an equity type award and accounted for the value of this award as if it had been awarded by us 
the c units were membership interests in op management and not a direct interest in us 
the c units are non transferable and have no voting power 
as of december   op management had distributed substantially all cash or requisite common stock to its members based on membership interests and distribution percentages 
op management was dissolved in in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb authoritative guidance for share based payments  we used a fair value based method to determine the value of stock based compensation awarded to our employees and recognized the entire grant date fair value of million as stock based compensation expense due to the immediate vesting of the awards with no future requisite service period required of the employees 
we used a probability weighted expected return method to evaluate the potential return and associated fair value allocable to the c unit shareholders using selected hypothetical future outcomes continuing operations  private sale and an initial public offering 
approximately of the fair value allocated to the c unit holders came from the ipo scenario 
the ipo fair value of the c units awarded to our employees was estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
the exercise price of the option used in the option pricing model was set equal to the maximum value of op management s current capital investment in the company as that value had to be returned to op management capital members before distributions were made to the c unit shareholders 
since we were not a public entity on the grant date  we did not have historical stock trading data to be used to compute volatilities associated with certain expected terms so the expected volatility value of was estimated based on an average of volatilities of similar sized oil and gas companies with operations in the williston basin whose common stocks were publicly traded 
the allocable fair value to the c units assumed an estimated timing of four years based on a future potential secondary offering or distribution of common stock of the company 
the risk free rate used in the pricing model was based on the us treasury yield for a government bond with a maturity equal to the time to liquidity of four years 
we did not estimate forfeiture rates due to the immediate vesting of the award and did not estimate future dividend payments as we did not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
discretionary stock awards 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million stock based compensation charge primarily associated with op management s grant of discretionary shares of our common stock to certain of our employees who were not c unit holders and certain contractors 
based on the characteristics of these awards  we concluded that they represented an equity type award and accounted for the value of these awards as if they had been awarded by us 
the fair value of these awards was based on the value of our common stock on the date of grant 
all of these awards vested immediately on the grant date with no future requisite service period required of the employees and contractors and were non dilutive to us 
treasury stock treasury stock shares represent shares withheld by us equivalent to the payroll tax withholding obligations due from employees upon the vesting of restricted stock awards 
we include the withheld shares as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheet and separately pay the payroll tax obligation 
these retained shares are not part of a publicly announced program to repurchase shares of our common stock and are accounted for at cost 
we do not have a publicly announced program to repurchase shares of our common stock 

table of contents income taxes our provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes 
we record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under gaap  which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
we apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from our estimates  which could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we also account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with gaap by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
recent accounting pronouncements intangible assets 
in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
the objective of asu is to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by permitting an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after september  we have adopted this new guidance  which did not have any impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements currently  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the sec 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various commitment agreements and other contractual obligations  some of which are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
see obligations and commitments above and note to our audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our commitments and contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks including commodity price risk  interest rate risk and counterparty and customer risk 
we address these risks through a program of risk management including the use of derivative instruments 
commodity price exposure risk 
we are exposed to market risk as the prices of oil and natural gas fluctuate as a result of changes in supply and demand and other factors 
to partially reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations  we have entered into derivative instruments in the past and expect to enter into derivative instruments in the future to cover a significant portion of our future production 
we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage risks related to changes in oil prices 
as of december   we utilized two way and three way collar options  swaps and put spreads to reduce the volatility of oil prices on a significant portion of our future expected oil production 
a two way collar is a combination of options a sold call and a purchased put 
the purchased put establishes a minimum price floor and the sold call establishes a maximum price ceiling we will receive for the volumes under contract 
a three way collar is a combination of options a sold call  a purchased put and a sold put 
the purchased put establishes a minimum price floor  unless the market price falls below the sold put sub floor  at which point the minimum price would be wti plus the difference between the purchased put and the sold put strike price 
the sold call establishes a maximum price ceiling we will receive for the volumes under contract 
a put spread is a combination of a purchased put and a sold put  and in this case does not include a sold call  allowing the volumes under this contract to have no established maximum price ceiling 
a swap is a sold call and a purchased put established at the same price both ceiling and floor 

table of contents we recognize all derivative instruments at fair value 
the credit standing of our counterparties is analyzed and factored into the fair value amounts recognized on the balance sheet 
derivative assets and liabilities arising from our derivative contracts with the same counterparty are also reported on a net basis  as all counterparty contracts provide for net settlement 
the following is a summary of our derivative contracts as of december  settlement period derivative instrument total notional amount of oil barrels average swap price average sub floor price average floor price average ceiling price fair value asset liability in thousands two way collar  three way collar  put spreads  swaps   two way collar  three way collar  put spreads  swaps  three way collar  interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed cash interest rate of per annum  million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed cash interest rate of and million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed cash interest rate of per annum outstanding 
during the year ended december   we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we do not currently  but may in the future utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issued under our revolving credit facility 
interest rate derivatives would be used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
counterparty and customer credit risk 
joint interest receivables arise from billing entities which own partial interest in the wells we operate 
these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we choose to drill 
we have limited ability to control participation in our wells 
we are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers 
the inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results 
while we do not require all of our customers to post collateral and we do not have a formal process in place to evaluate and assess the credit standing of our significant customers for oil and natural gas receivables and the counterparties on our derivative instruments  we do evaluate the credit standing of such counterparties as we deem appropriate under the circumstances 
this evaluation may include reviewing a counterparty s credit rating  latest financial information and  in the case of a customer with which we have receivables  their historical payment record  the financial ability of the customer s parent company to make payment if the customer cannot and undertaking the due diligence necessary to determine credit terms and credit limits 
several of our significant customers for oil and natural gas receivables have a credit rating below investment grade or do not have rated debt securities 
in these circumstances  we have considered the lack of investment grade credit rating in addition to the other factors described above 
as permitted under our investments policy  we may purchase commercial paper instruments from high credit quality counterparties 
these counterparties may include issuers in a variety of industries including the domestic and foreign financial sector 
this risk is managed by our investment policy including minimum credit ratings thresholds and maximum counterparty exposure values 
although we do not anticipate any of our commercial paper issuers failing to pay us upon maturity  we take a risk in purchasing the commercial paper instruments available in the marketplace 
if an issuer fails to repay us at maturity from commercial paper proceeds  it could take a significant amount of time to recover a portion of or all of the assets originally invested 
our commercial paper balance was million at december  in addition  our oil and natural gas derivative arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
however  in order to mitigate the risk of nonperformance  we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that are high credit quality financial institutions 
the counterparties on our derivative instruments currently in place are lenders under our revolving credit facility with investment grade ratings 
we are likely to enter into any future derivative instruments with these or other lenders under our revolving credit facility  which also carry investment grade ratings 
this risk is also managed by spreading our derivative exposure across several institutions and limiting the hedged volumes placed under individual contracts 
furthermore  the agreements with each of the counterparties on our derivative instruments contain netting provisions 
as a result of these netting provisions  our maximum amount of loss due to credit risk is limited to the net amounts due to and from the counterparties under the derivative contracts 
we had a net derivative asset position of million and a net derivative liability position of million at december
