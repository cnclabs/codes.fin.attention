item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview aruba networks  inc is a leading global provider of enterprise mobility solutions 
we develop  market and sell products and services designed to solve our customers secure mobility requirements though our move architecture  which unifies the network infrastructure  access management and mobility applications into one integrated system that offers strong security and a simplified approach to byod initiatives 
we believe the market for mobility solutions in the enterprise is changing and that the explosion of mobile devices is forcing it departments to radically revise the way they approach provisioning and supporting these devices in the workplace 
our goal is to provide simplified  dependable solutions that permit it departments to quickly  securely and cost effectively meet their mobility and byod needs 
we address these needs with our flexible move architecture  a fundamentally new network architecture  designed for an increasingly mobile universe of end users 
our move architecture is comprised of three major components 
the first component consists of our mobility centric network infrastructure  including our mobility controllers and software modules  wireless access points  mobility access switches  remote access points  vpn software and airwave management 
the second component is our next generation access management solution  including clearpass software for network access control as well as device and application management 
the third component consists of our mobility applications  including our workspace mobile application  our apis and our meridian application for visitor engagement through indoor way finding and targeted location based messaging 
aruba conducts business in three geographic regions americas  emea  and apj 
our products and services have been sold to more than  customers worldwide  including some of the largest and most complex global organizations 
our customer base spans major industries and verticals  including general enterprise  high tech enterprise  industrial enterprise  higher education  k education  health care  retail  federal state local government  financial services and hospitality 
we typically sell to and support these customers through a two tier distribution model in most areas of the world  including the united states 
our vads and oems sell our portfolio of products  including a variety of our support services  to a diverse number of vars  system integrators and service providers 
also  certain of our oems sell directly to end customers 
major trends affecting our financial results worldwide economic conditions our business depends on the overall demand for it initiatives and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers to make capital commitments 
if the conditions in the global economic environment remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  or if these conditions deteriorate  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected in a material way 
economic weakness  customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on it initiatives have resulted  and may in the future result  in challenging and delayed sales cycles and could negatively impact our ability to forecast future periods 
sequestration or other significant cuts in us government spending could adversely affect our future results 
we cannot be assured of the level of it spending  the deterioration of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
revenue our ability to increase our revenue will depend significantly on continued growth in the market for enterprise mobility and remote networking solutions  continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  our ability to continue to attract new customers  our ability to compete  the willingness of customers to displace wired networks with wireless lans  our ability to retain existing distribution partners  and our ability to continue to sell into our installed base of existing customers 
we believe that our move architecture  including our clearpass and aruba instant offerings  will enable broader networking initiatives by both our current and potential customers 
our growth in support revenue is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will also be directly affected by the timing and size of orders  product and channel mix  average selling prices  costs of our products  our ability to effectively manage our two tier distribution model  general economic conditions  and the extent to which we invest in our sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative resources 

table of contents the revenue growth that we have experienced has been driven primarily by an expansion of our customer base coupled with increased purchases from existing customers 
we believe the growth we have experienced is the result of business enterprises and other organizations needing to provide secure mobility to their users in a manner that we believe is more cost effective than the traditional approach of using port centric networks 
our revenue grew in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this performance was driven by solid execution  improvements across most of our geographical theatres and increased demand in our core verticals globally 
looking forward  we believe that we have strong growth drivers with our ac products  clearpass  public facing enterprise solutions and aruba instant 
our ability to meet our product revenue expectations is dependent upon new orders received  shipped  and recognized in a given quarter  the amount of orders booked but not shipped in prior quarters that are shipped in the current quarter  and the amount of deferred revenue entering a given quarter that is recognized as revenue in the quarter 
our product deferred revenue is comprised of product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the agreement  typically with our large customers  contain acceptance terms and conditions or other terms that require that the revenue be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met  and product orders shipped to our vads and oems for which we have not yet received persuasive evidence of sell through from the vads or oems 
we typically ship products within days after the receipt of an order 
costs and expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the largest component of our operating expenses in each of these categories is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation for employees 
as of july   we had  employees worldwide compared to  employees at july  the increase in employees is the most significant driver behind the increase in costs and operating expenses in the year ended july  we expect to continue investing in our infrastructure and operations  including continuation of hiring of employees throughout the company 
significant events our consolidated financial statements during the year ended july  were affected by certain significant events that should be considered in comparing the periods presented 
business combinations on may   we acquired meridian apps  inc meridian  a privately held mobile software company providing software for visitor engagement through indoor way finding and targeted location based messaging 
the purchase price was million  all of which was paid in cash 
in addition  we are obligated to pay additional cash consideration of up to million to certain former meridian employees who became our employees  which will be made over a period of approximately three years from the closing date  subject to certain continued employment restrictions 
for the year ended july   we recorded compensation costs of million in general and administrative expenses associated with this additional cash compensation 
acquisition related costs  included in general and administrative expenses  were not material 
as a result of the acquisition  we expect to offer new indoor location based services by combining our unique  network based contextual information about users  devices and applications with meridian wi fi based visitor engagement solution for smart phones and tablets 
in connection with this acquisition  we retained the services of a third party firm to complete a valuation of the assets acquired in order to allocate the purchase price consideration 
the total purchase price consideration was allocated to the net tangible and identified intangible assets based upon the fair values as of may   in accordance with our review and oversight of the third party valuation 
the excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price consideration of the acquisition was allocated as follows in thousands  except years 
table of contents purchase price consideration cash tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed estimated useful lives identifiable intangible assets existing technology years patent years customer contracts and related relationships years trade name and trademarks years goodwill total purchase price consideration we expensed million of acquisition related costs incurred as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in fiscal stock repurchase on june   we announced a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock  which was increased by an additional million on july  we are authorized to make repurchases in the market until our board of directors terminates the program or until expenditures reach the authorized amount  whichever occurs first 
any repurchases under the program will be funded from available working capital 
the number of shares repurchased and the timing of purchases are based on the price of our common stock  general business and market conditions and other investment considerations 
shares are retired upon repurchase and it is our policy to charge any excess of cost over par value entirely to additional paid in capital 
during the fiscal years ended july  and  we repurchased a total of  shares and  shares  respectively for a total of purchase price of million and million  respectively 
at july   million remains authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program 
legal settlement during the fourth quarter of our fiscal  we reached a settlement resolving the lawsuit filed against us by nomadix  inc as part of the settlement  we agreed to pay nomadix an amount in consideration for  among other things  a perpetual non exclusive license to the patent asserted by nomadix 
the settlement amount was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the terms of the settlement are confidential 
although the settlement did have a material impact to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss  it did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flows for fiscal revenue  cost of revenue and operating expenses revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our arubaos operating system  controllers  wired and wireless access points  switches  application software modules  access management solution  multi vendor management solution software  and professional services and support 
we sell our products and services directly through our sales force and indirectly through partners including vads  vars  service providers and oems 
we expect revenue from indirect channels to continue to constitute a significant majority of our future revenue 
we sell our products to channel partners and end customers located in the united states  europe  middle east  africa  asia pacific  japan and other parts of the world 
we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets  and we expect international revenue to increase in absolute dollars and increase as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal for more information about our international revenue  see note  segment information and significant customers  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
professional services revenue consists of consulting and training services 
consulting services primarily consist of design 
table of contents and installation support services 
training services are typically instructor led courses on the use of our products 
support services typically consist of software updates  on a when and if available basis  and telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
we provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue consists primarily of manufacturing costs for our products  shipping and logistics costs  charges for inventory obsolescence  amortization of existing technology and warranty obligations 
we utilize third parties to manufacture our products and perform shipping logistics 
we have outsourced the substantial majority of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations 
accordingly  the substantial majority of our cost of product revenue consists of payments to our contract manufacturers 
our contract manufacturers produce our products in asia using quality assurance programs and standards that we jointly established 
manufacturing  engineering and documentation controls are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california  bangalore  india and beijing  china 
cost of product revenue also includes amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 
cost of professional services and support revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs  including stock based compensation  for providing technical support 
in addition  we engage third party support vendors to complement our internal support resources  the costs of which are included within costs of professional services and support revenue 
gross margin our gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including changes in the mix of products sold or manner in which products are sold in our channel  the percentage of revenue from international regions  increased price competition and discounting pressures  increases in material  labor or other manufacturing related costs  excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers  write downs for obsolete or excess inventory  increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand  timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals  warranty related issues  freight charges  our introduction of new products or new product platforms or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures  amortization expense from our intangible assets which is mainly existing technology  and amortization of capitalized software development costs 
due to higher net effective discounts for products sold through our indirect channel  our overall gross margins for indirect channel sales are typically lower than those associated with direct sales 
we expect product revenue from our indirect channel to continue to constitute a significant majority of our total revenue  which we expect will continue to negatively impact our gross margin 
further  we expect that within our indirect channel  sales through our vads and oems will continue to be significant  which will negatively impact our gross margins as vads and oems generally experience a larger net effective discount than our other channel partners 
research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and facilities costs 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because we believe it is essential to maintaining our competitive position 
for fiscal  we expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consist of personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
a portion of the amortization expense related to our intangible assets is also included in sales and marketing expenses 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest strategically in sales and marketing with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base  expand our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 
we 
table of contents expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive  and thus  the increase in sales and marketing expenses that we experience as we hire additional sales personnel is not expected to immediately result in increased revenue 
as a result  these expenses will reduce our operating margin until the new sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance 
for fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to invest strategically in this area and will increase as percentage of revenue compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  as well as insurance  investor relations  and it infrastructure costs related to our enterprise resource planning erp system 
further  our general and administrative expenses include professional services consisting of outside legal  audit  sarbanes oxley and it consulting costs 
we have incurred in the past  and may continue to incur  significant legal costs defending ourselves against claims made by third parties 
these expenses are expected to continue as part of our ongoing operations and  depending on the timing and outcome of lawsuits and the legal process  could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
for fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal however  third party professional services are subject to material fluctuations given the needs of the business  which may cause our expected expenditures in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue to differ from our forecasted expectations 
other income  net other income  net includes interest income on cash balances  accretion of discount or amortization of premium on short term investments  losses or gains from foreign exchange rate changes  and in connection with our acquisition of azalea networks azalea from september  to december   changes in the fair value or gains from the release of our contingent rights liability 
see note  business combinations of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the azalea acquisition and the contingent rights liability 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  share based compensation  inventory valuation  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition total revenue is derived primarily from the sale of products and services  including professional services and support 
the following revenue recognition policies define the manner in which we account for our sales transactions 
we recognize revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred or the title and risk of loss has passed  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the customer has accepted  or once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments are received  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction to revenue upon shipment based on our contractual obligations and historical returns experience 
in cases 
table of contents where we are aware of circumstances that will likely result in a specific customer request to return purchased equipment  we record a specific sales returns reserve 
our revenue recognition policies provide that  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available  third party evidence tpe of selling price  if vsoe is not available  or best estimated selling price besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
in multiple element arrangements where non essential software deliverables are included  revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverable and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the hierarchy in the applicable accounting guidance 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices when sold separately 
vsoe for support services is measured by the stand alone renewal rate offered to the customer 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for an element falls within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates 
in addition  we consider major service groups  geographies  customer classifications  and other variables in determining vsoe 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine selling prices of competitor products and services on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the selling price of our non software elements using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost of products  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we regularly review estimated selling price of the product offerings and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
we currently do not expect a material impact in the near term from changes in estimated selling prices  including vsoe of selling price 
products product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our hardware appliances and perpetual software licenses 
the majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  our hardware appliances are considered non software elements and are not subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
for these appliances  delivery occurs upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to ensure an end user has been identified by the channel partner prior to shipment to a channel partner 
for end users and channel partners  we generally have no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
for sales to direct end users and certain channel partners  including value added resellers vars  and original equipment manufacturers oems  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we also sell through value added distributors vads 
a significant portion of our sales are made through vads under agreements allowing for stocking of our products in their inventory  pricing credits and limited rights of return for stock rotation 
product revenue on sales made through these vads is initially deferred and revenue is recognized upon sell through as reported by the vads to us 
our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software products may operate on our hardware appliance but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware 
sales of stand alone software generally include a perpetual license to our software 
for sales of stand alone software  we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when only the 
table of contents undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of selling price is support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
services service revenue consists of revenue from support agreements  professional services  and training 
support services include repair and replacement of defective hardware appliances  software updates and access to technical support personnel 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
revenue for support services is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one to five years 
revenue for professional services is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within days from the start of service 
revenue for training services is recognized upon delivery of the training 
costs associated with these service offerings are expensed as incurred 
post contractual services pcs that we provide to our channel partners differ from pcs that we provide to our end customers in that we are only obligated to provide support services to the channel partner directly  while the channel partner is obligated to provide support services directly to the end customer 
the channel partner is obligated to provide to the end customer first level troubleshooting assistance as well as second level support for high level technical and product diagnosis which might include returned merchandise fulfillment 
our obligations are only to provide software upgrades and  in the unusual scenario in which the channel partner is unable to provide the technical support that the end customer requires  a third level technical diagnosis and support 
services revenue also includes certain revenue arrangements prior to the second quarter of fiscal and those acquired through business combinations where we were not able to establish vsoe on prior services and support offerings are recognized ratably over the support period 
as discussed in note  the company and its significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  ratable product and related professional services and support revenue and the related cost of revenue in fiscal years and have been reclassified to professional services and support revenue and related cost of revenue 
shipping and handling shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and non employees under the fair value method 
our stock based payment awards include stock options  restricted stock units and awards  employee stock purchase plan awards and performance based awards 
we calculate the fair value of restricted stock based on the fair market value on the date of grant 
we calculate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
we determine the amount of stock based compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
in addition  compensation expense includes the effects of awards modified  repurchased or cancelled 
inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using the standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory write downs for potentially excess inventory based on forecasted demand  economic trends  technological obsolescence of our products and transition of inventory related to new product releases 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in cost of product revenue in the period the revision is made 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
inventory write downs amounted to million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively with amounts increasing as a result of growth in our business  as well as new product releases and increased diversity of our product offerings 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  our management considers  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  including trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and general economic conditions  especially given the recent financial crisis in today s economic environment 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at july  and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we perform impairment testing on goodwill at least annually  as of june th  and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist at the reporting unit level 
we perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we perform a two step impairment test 
the first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
under the second step  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
there have been no impairments recorded in any of the periods presented 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from one to years 
amortization expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to estimated results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
determination of recoverability of purchased intangible assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
we did not record any impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill and intangible impairment tests 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which zero us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us we plan any remittances of foreign earnings to the us based on projected cash flow  working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the united states and provide us 
table of contents federal taxes on these amounts 
as of july   we estimate that all foreign earnings are permanently reinvested outside the us and therefore have excluded a us tax provision on these earnings 
material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the united states or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the us could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate 
we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  historical earnings  taxable income in prior years  if carryback is permitted under the law  carry forward periods  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we were to determine that not all or part of our net deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination  or goodwill would be adjusted if the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets acquired in a business combination and the adjustment is within the measurement period 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time 
based on an evaluation of the above factors  we recorded a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize certain california research credit carryforwards 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
our evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change  which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to recent accounting pronouncements  under note  the company and its significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us

provision for income taxes years ended july  in thousands income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss effective tax rate our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the us federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to fixed amortization of tax capitalized in connection with an international restructuring in fiscal  state taxes  nondeductible stock based compensation  research and development tax credits  difference between foreign tax rates and us tax rate  and an increase in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation 
our effective tax rate for fiscal differed from the effective tax rate for fiscal primarily due to an increase in non deductible stock based compensation  an increase in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a change in the mix of our earnings or loss to jurisdictions with different tax rates  partially offset by an increase in our federal research credit benefit of approximately million recorded in fiscal due to the retroactive extension of the credit to fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal differed from the effective tax rate for fiscal primarily due to the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal in fiscal  we implemented a new structure of our corporate organization to more closely align our corporate organization with the international nature of our business activities and to reduce our overall effective tax rate through changes in how we develop and use our intellectual property and the structure of our international procurement and sales  including transfer price arrangements for intercompany transactions 
we recorded a deferred charge during the first quarter of fiscal related to the deferral of income tax expense on intercompany profits that resulted from the sale of our intellectual property rights outside of north and south america to our irish subsidiary 
the deferred charge is included in prepaid and other assets and other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of july   the balance in prepaid and other assets was million  and million in other non current assets 
the deferred charge is amortized on a straight line basis as a component of income tax expense over three to five years  based on the economic life of the intellectual property and will increase our effective tax rate during the amortization period 
the deferred charge resulted in a point increase to our effective tax rate for the year ending july  from to 
while we have yet to realize any tax savings to date  we expect to realize a reduction in our effective tax rate as a result of our corporate reorganization after the deferred charges have been fully amortized

liquidity and capital resources july july in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments years ended july  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities as of july   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash  sweep funds and money market funds with an original maturity of days or less at the time of purchase 
short term investments include corporate bonds  us government agency securities  us treasury bills  commercial paper  and certificates of deposit 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million during fiscal from million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of july  to million as of july  as of july   we had million of cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states  the significant majority of which can be repatriated without adverse tax consequences 
historically  we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs and acquisition activities 
it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital  provides liquidity and maintains appropriate diversification and optimizes current income within our policy s framework 
we are averse to principal loss and attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
our investment policy is designed to prevent fluctuations in market value which materially affect our financial results 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by our profitability  working capital requirements  the extent to which we increase spending on personnel and the continued growth in revenue and cash collections 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and cash flows from sales personnel 
in the future  we anticipate achieving cash tax savings and a reduction in our overall tax rate as a result of the new structure of our corporate organization implemented in fiscal offset by increases in our cash tax obligations after our tax loss and credit carryforwards have been utilized 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  purchases of inventory  and rent payments 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million compared to fiscal the additional cash flows generated from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash flows of million from operations after adjusting for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation  and an 
table of contents increase of million from the change in operating assets and liabilities 
these additional cash flows were partially offset by an increase in our net loss of million 
the million change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in other current and non current accrued liabilities 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million compared to fiscal the additional cash flow generated from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash flow of million from operations after adjusting for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation  and an increase of million from the change in operating assets and liabilities 
these additional cash flows were partially offset by a decrease in net income of million in fiscal compared to the million change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in deferred revenue and income taxes payable 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal we purchased million more short term investments during fiscal compared to fiscal as we reinvested cash flow from operations 
purchases of property and equipment in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal due to an increase in investments in our research and development infrastructure 
the higher level of direct research and development investment was offset by lower acquisition expenditures 
we completed one acquisition during fiscal for a total cash purchase price consideration of million  net of cash received  compared to two acquisitions in fiscal totaling million  net of cash received 
see note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investing activities increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal we purchased million more short term investments during fiscal compared to fiscal as we reinvested cash flow from operations 
purchases of property and equipment in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal due to an increase in headcount 
further  we completed two acquisitions during fiscal for a total of million of cash used  net of cash received  compared to two acquisitions in fiscal totaling million  net of cash received 
see note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities cash provided by used in financing activities changed by million during fiscal compared to fiscal and primarily consisted of the increase of cash used in our stock repurchase program of million compared to fiscal  combined with a change in the excess tax benefit associated with stock based compensation of million and by a decrease from cash provided from issuance of common stock of million 
cash provided by financing activities was essentially flat in fiscal compared to fiscal and primarily consisted of the cash proceeds of million we received from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our equity plans 
in addition  during fiscal  we started receiving tax benefits associated with stock based compensation of million 
this tax benefit was slightly offset by million of cash used to repurchase our common stock 
based on our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we expect that we will have sufficient resources to fund our operations for the next months 
however  we may  in the future  need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations or support acquisition activity 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the continuing market acceptance of our products and potential future business acquisitions 
contractual obligations commitments operating leases and purchase obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents purchase obligations represent contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and exclude contractual amounts that are cancelable without penalty 
these contractual amounts are related principally to inventory  information technology and marketing related purchase agreements 
uncertain tax positions other long term liabilities on our balance sheet include million of long term income taxes payable for uncertain tax positions 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and therefore have excluded them from the preceding table 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies  which we review annually to determine if they should be accounted for as variable interest entities 
for the year ended july   we evaluated our investments in these privately held companies and concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest from investment entities 
as a result  we account for these investments on a cost basis and do not consolidate the activity of these investee entities 
certain events can require a reassessment of our investments in privately held companies to determine if they meet the criteria for variable interest entities and to determine which stakeholders in such entities will be the primary beneficiary 
in the event of a reassessment  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities in future periods 
as of july   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk as of july   foreign currency cash accounts totaled million  primarily in euros  british pounds  and indian rupees 
nearly all of our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  our revenue is not subject to significant foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro  indian rupee  and chinese yuan 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts because expenses in foreign currencies have been insignificant  and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for foreign currency exchange rate risk  a increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a million change in the value of our foreign currency cash accounts 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and million as of july   and july   respectively 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
if overall interest rates had fallen by during fiscal  our interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments would have declined by million assuming consistent investment levels
