when used in this discussion  the terms avon  company  we  our or us mean  unless the context otherwise indicates  avon products  inc and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries 
refer to the non gaap financial measures section on pages through of this annual report for a description of how constant dollar constant growth rates a non gaap financial measure are determined 
overview we are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products 
our business is conducted worldwide  primarily in the direct selling channel 
we presently have sales operations in countries and territories  including the united states us  and distribute products in more 
our reportable segments are based on geographic operations and include commercial business units in latin america  europe  middle east africa  north america  and asia pacific 
our product categories are beauty  fashion and home 
beauty consists of color cosmetics  fragrances  skin care and personal care 
fashion consists of jewelry  watches  apparel  footwear  accessories and children s products 
home consists of gift and decorative products  housewares  entertainment and leisure products  children s products and nutritional products 
sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by more than million active independent representatives  who are independent contractors and not our employees 
the success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting  retaining and servicing our representatives 
during  approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside the us total revenue in declined due to unfavorable foreign exchange 
constant revenue was relatively unchanged  as a increase in average order was offset by a decline in active representatives 
sales of products in the beauty category decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange  and increased on a constant basis 
sales of products in the fashion category decreased  or on a constant basis 
sales of products in the home category decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange  and increased on a constant basis 
our constant revenue was impacted by improvements in latin america  particularly in brazil  mexico  and venezuela  however  these improvements were offset by net declines in other regions 
in europe  middle east africa we saw a revenue decline in the united kingdom that partially reflects a continued weak macroeconomic environment  competition  and executional challenges 
in addition  north america experienced challenging financial results  partially as a result of the ongoing impact of field transformation and redistricting in the us asia pacific revenue decline was primarily due to continuing weak performance of our china operations 
see the segment review section of this md a for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment 
we recently outlined initial steps toward achieving a cost savings target of before taxes by the end of in connection with this cost savings target  on december   we announced initial steps of a cost savings initiative the m cost savings initiative  in an effort to stabilize the business and return avon to sustainable growth 
the m cost savings initiative includes a global headcount reduction and related actions  as well as our exit from the south korea and vietnam markets 
as part of the m cost savings initiative  we identified certain actions in the fourth quarter of  the majority of which are expected to take effect in  that we believe will accelerate top line growth and reduce costs 
as a result of these actions  we recorded total costs to implement these various restructuring initiatives of before taxes associated with approved initiatives 
for the initiatives approved to date  we expect our total costs to implement to be in the range of to before taxes 
at this time we are unable to quantify the total costs when the initiative is fully implemented 
in connection with the initial steps of the m cost savings initiative  we expect to realize annualized savings of approximately before taxes 
in an effort to improve operating performance  we identified certain actions in  not associated with the m cost savings initiative and and restructuring programs  that we believe will enhance our operating model  reduce costs  and improve efficiencies 
as a result of the analysis and the actions taken  we recorded total costs to implement of before taxes in in connection with these actions  effective in the second quarter of  central eastern europe and western europe  middle east africa are being managed as a single operating segment 
accordingly  europe  middle east africa amounts include the results of central eastern europe and western europe  middle east africa for all periods presented 
in connection with these actions  we expect to realize operating profit benefits of approximately annually and cash flow benefits of approximately after taxes annually beginning in  which will likely be a mitigating factor against inflationary cost pressures 
refer to note  restructuring initiatives on pages f through f of our annual report for further information 
in conjunction with organizational changes  effective in the second quarter of  the dominican republic was included in latin america whereas in prior periods it had been included in north america 
the impact was not material to either segment 
accordingly  the results of the dominican republic are included in latin america and excluded from north america for all periods presented 
as part of an overall review of our capital structure  on november   we announced a decrease in our quarterly cash dividend to 
per share from 
per share  for the fourth quarter dividend paid in december we have maintained the dividend of 
for the first quarter of as a result of the devaluation of the venezuelan currency in february  our operating margin will be negatively impacted 
as a result  we expect the company operating profit to be negatively impacted primarily in the first half of by approximately of costs associated with the historical cost in us dollars of nonmonetary assets 
in addition to the negative impact to operating margin  as a result of the devaluation of the venezuelan currency  during the first quarter of we expect to record net charges of approximately in other expense  net and approximately in income taxes  reflecting the write down of monetary assets and liabilities and deferred tax benefits

new accounting standards information relating to new accounting standards is included in note  new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
performance metrics within this md a  in addition to our key financial metrics of revenue  operating profit and operating margin  we utilize the performance metrics defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business 
performance metrics definition growth in active representatives this metric is based on the number of orders in a campaign  totaled for all campaigns in the related period 
this amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period  to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days for example  holiday schedules 
to determine the growth in active representatives  this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year 
change in units this metric is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period  as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year 
units sold include samples sold and products contingent upon the purchase of another product for example  gift with purchase or discount purchase with purchase  but exclude free samples 
inventory days this metric is equal to the number of days of cost of sales  based on the average of the preceding months  covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period 
non gaap financial measures to supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars  including changes in revenue  operating profit  adjusted non gaap operating profit  operating margin  and adjusted non gaap operating margin 
we refer to these adjusted financial measures as constant items  which are non gaap financial measures 
we believe these measures provide investors an additional perspective on trends 
to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars  we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate 
currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates 
we also present gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  net global expenses  operating profit  operating margin and effective tax rate on a non gaap basis 
the discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a non gaap basis 
we have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non gaap financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with gaap 
the company uses the non gaap financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of  on a period to period basis  the impacts of costs to implement cti restructuring initiatives  the goodwill and intangible assets charges related to silpada and the goodwill charge related to china each an impairment charge  and collectively  impairment charges  costs and charges related to venezuela being designated as a highly inflationary economy and the subsequent devaluation of its currency in january  as well as the benefit related to the release of a provision associated with the excess cost of acquiring us dollars in venezuela venezuelan special items  and the additional provision for income taxes as we are no longer asserting that the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested special tax items 
the company believes investors find the non gaap information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the company financial results in any particular period 
the impairment charges include the impact on the statement of income caused by the goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges related to silpada in and and the goodwill impairment charge related to china in the venezuelan special items include the impact on the statement of income caused by the devaluation of the venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities  such as cash  receivables and payables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and nonmonetary assets  such as inventory and prepaid expenses 
for nonmonetary assets  the venezuelan special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical cost of the assets at the previous official exchange rate of and the revised official exchange rate of 
the venezuelan special items also include the impact on the statement of income caused by the release of a provision associated with the excess cost of acquiring us dollars in venezuela at the regulated market rate as compared to the official exchange rate 
the special tax items include the impact on the statement of income in caused by an additional provision for income taxes as we are no longer asserting that the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the company may repatriate offshore cash to meet certain domestic funding needs 
see note  restructuring initiatives on pages f through f of our annual report  note  goodwill and intangible assets on pages f through f of our annual report  the segment review latin america section below  and note  income taxes on pages f through f of our annual report for more information on these items 
these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting estimates we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
see note  description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies  on pages f through f of our annual report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
restructuring reserves we record the estimated expense for our restructuring initiatives when such costs are deemed probable and estimable  when approved by the appropriate corporate authority and by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans 
these expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits  impairment or accelerated depreciation of property  plant and equipment  and any other qualifying exit costs 
these estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel 
such costs represent our best estimate  but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time  including attrition rates 
estimates are evaluated periodically to determine whether an adjustment is required 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable representatives contact their customers  selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign 
sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the us and a two to four week duration outside the us the representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user 
in general  the representative  an independent contractor  remits a payment to us during each sales campaign  which relates to the prior campaign cycle 
the representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid  however  there are circumstances where the representative fails to make the required payment 
we record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances  including selling schedules  business operations  seasonality and changing trends 
over the past three years  annual bad debt expense was in  in  and in  or approximately of total revenue in each year 
bad debt expense as a percent of revenue increased by approximately 
point in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in europe  middle east africa 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy  at a minimum  on a quarterly basis 
we generally have no detailed information concerning  or any communication with  any end user of our products beyond the representative 
we have no legal recourse against the end user for the collection of any accounts receivable balances due from the representative to us 
if the financial condition of our representatives were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowances for sales returns policies and practices for product returns vary by jurisdiction  but within many jurisdictions  we generally allow an unlimited right of return 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
over the past three years  annual sales returns were for  for  and for  or approximately of total revenue in each year  which has been generally in line with our expectations 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns  due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies  or for other reasons  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence  we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle  future marketing sales plans and the disposition process 
we assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision 
if actual sales are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence 
annual obsolescence expense was for  for  and for pension  postretirement and postemployment expense we maintain defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all employees in the us and a portion of employees in international locations 
additionally  we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care and life insurance benefits through the end of only subject to certain limitations to the majority of retired employees in the us and certain foreign countries 
see note  employee benefit plans  on pages f through f of our annual report for further information on our benefit plans 
pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  the interest crediting rate for hybrid plans and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations 
for  the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets  including the us and us plans was  compared to for in determining the long term rates of return  we consider the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies  historical rates of return and current economic forecasts 
we evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary 
the majority of our pension plan assets relate to the us pension plan 
the assumed rate of return for for the us plan was  which was based on an asset allocation of approximately in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term and approximately in equity securities and high yield securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term 
historical rates of return on the assets of the us plan were approximately for the most recent year period and approximately for the year period 
in the us plan  our asset allocation policy has favored us equity securities  which have returned approximately over the year period and approximately over the year period 
the rate of return on the plan assets in the us was approximately in and approximately in regulations under the pension protection act of  which are finalized but not yet effective  will require that hybrid plans limit the maximum interest crediting rate to one among several choices of crediting rates which are considered market rates of return 
the rate chosen will affect total pension obligations 
the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency 
the discount rates for our more significant plans  including our us plan  were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan 
the weighted average discount rate for us and non us plans determined on this basis was at december   and at december  for the determination of the expected rate of return on assets and the discount rate  we take into consideration external actuarial advice 
our funding requirements may be impacted by regulations or interpretations thereof 
our calculations of pension  postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent on the use of assumptions  including discount rates  hybrid plan maximum interest crediting rates and expected return on plan assets discussed above  rate of compensation increase of plan participants  interest cost  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  mortality rates  the number of associate retirements  the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors 
actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   we had pretax actuarial losses  prior service credits  and transition obligations totaling for the us pension and postretirement plans and for the non us pension and postretirement plans that have not yet been charged to expense 
these actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity 
while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension  postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense 
for  our assumption for the expected rate of return on assets is for our us plans and for our non us plans 
our assumptions are reviewed and determined on an annual basis 
a basis point change in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases  would have had approximately the following effect on pension expense and the pension benefit obligation at december  increase decrease in pension expense increase decrease in pension obligation basis point basis point increase decrease increase decrease rate of return on assets n a n a discount rate rate of compensation increase taxes at december   we recognized net deferred tax assets of  net of a valuation allowance of we have gross deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards of primarily from foreign jurisdictions  for which a valuation allowance of has been provided 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future  in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made 
we have recognized deferred tax assets of relating to foreign tax credit carryforwards that will expire between and to the extent future taxable income is less favorable than currently projected  our ability to utilize these foreign tax credits may be affected and a valuation allowance may be required 
we recognize deferred income taxes with respect to the incremental us taxes that would be incurred when undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary are subsequently repatriated  unless management has determined that those undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested for the foreseeable future 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not recognized a deferred income tax liability related to the incremental us taxes on approximately billion of undistributed foreign earnings  as these earnings were deemed indefinitely reinvested 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of the uncertainty of our financing arrangements and our domestic liquidity profile  we determined that we may repatriate offshore cash to meet certain domestic funding needs 
accordingly  we are no longer asserting that these undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested and have provided us income taxes on such earnings 
at december   we have a deferred income tax liability of for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us we have not recorded a us income tax benefit on of undistributed earnings of our subsidiary in venezuela where local regulations restrict cash distributions 
the actual tax cost of distributing these foreign earnings to the us will depend on the amount and timing of the repatriation and the jurisdictions involved 
we recognize the benefit of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in  a number of open tax years are scheduled to close due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed 
if our tax positions are ultimately upheld or denied  it is possible that the provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments 
share based compensation stock options issued to employees are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair value using an option pricing model at the date of grant 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options 
this model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation may differ materially in the future from historical results 
loss contingencies we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  and more frequently if circumstances warrant  using various fair value methods 
we review finite lived intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment for during the year end close process and determined that the estimated fair values were considered substantially in excess of the carrying values of each of our reporting units  with the exception of our silpada and china reporting units 
our analysis of the silpada business indicated an impairment as the carrying value of the business exceeded the estimated fair value and the finite lived intangible assets were not recoverable 
this was primarily the result of the weaker than expected performance in the fourth quarter of  largely due to lower representative counts and activity rates  and as a result we lowered our revenue and earnings projections for silpada 
accordingly  a non cash impairment charge of was recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of goodwill  an indefinite lived intangible asset  and a finite lived intangible asset 
at december   as a result of the impairment charge recorded  the carrying values of silpada s goodwill  indefinite lived intangible asset  and finite lived intangible asset were   and respectively 
the decline in the fair values of the silpada assets was driven by the reduction in the forecasted growth rates and cash flows used to estimate their respective fair values 
our annual analysis  completed during the year end close process  of the china business indicated that the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
the goodwill associated with china was at december  during the third quarter of  based on the continued decline in revenue performance in china  and a corresponding lowering of our long term growth estimates in china  we completed an interim impairment assessment of the fair value of goodwill related to our operations in china 
the results of our interim impairment test indicated the estimated fair value of our china reporting unit was less than its respective carrying amount 
accordingly  a non cash impairment charge of was recorded to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to its estimated fair value 
the changes to our long term growth estimates were based on the state of our china business  which was predominantly retail at that time 
during the year end close process  our analysis of the silpada business indicated an impairment as the carrying value of the business exceeded the estimated fair value 
accordingly  a non cash impairment charge of was recorded in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying amounts of goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset 
following weaker than expected performance in the fourth quarter of  we lowered our revenue and earnings projections for silpada largely due to the rise in silver prices  which nearly doubled since the acquisition  and the negative impact of pricing on revenues and margins 
the decline in the fair values of the silpada reporting unit and the underlying trademark was driven by the reduction in the forecasted growth rates and cash flows used to estimate their respective fair value 
the impairment analyses performed for goodwill and intangible assets require several estimates in computing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit  an indefinite lived intangible asset  and a finite lived intangible asset 
we use a discounted cash flow dcf approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit  which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of a business  and is most consistent with the approach a market place participant would use 
the estimation of fair value utilizing a dcf approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates  as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions  and the structure that would yield the highest economic value  among other factors 
key assumptions used in measuring the fair values of silpada and china included the discount rate based on the weighted average cost of capital and revenue growth  as well as silver prices and representative growth and activity rates for silpada 
the fair value of silpada indefinite lived trademark was determined using a risk adjusted dcf model under the relief from royalty method 
the royalty rate used was based on a consideration of market rates 
the fair value of the silpada finite lived customer relationships was determined using a dcf model under the multi period excess earnings method 
a significant decline in expected future cash flows and growth rates or a change in the discount rate used to fair value expected future cash flows may result in future impairment charges

on a constant basis  brazil s sales of beauty products increased and sales of non beauty were flat 
constant revenue growth in mexico was driven by an increase in active representatives  as well as higher average order 
revenue growth in venezuela was primarily due to higher average order  benefiting from the inflationary impact on pricing  however  venezuela revenue growth was restrained during the latter half of by slowing economic activity and the impact of lower inflation on pricing

additional information on our venezuela operations is discussed in more detail below 
operating margin was negatively impacted by 
points as compared to the prior year period from higher cti restructuring 
adjusted non gaap operating margin declined points  or points on a constant basis  primarily as a result of a decline of points due to lower gross margin caused primarily by 
points from higher supply chain costs not offset by pricing 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by 
points from foreign exchange and

effective january   we began to account for venezuela as a highly inflationary economy 
effective january   the venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure 
the official exchange rate moved from to for essential goods and to for nonessential goods and services 
effective december   the venezuelan government eliminated the rate which had been available for the import of essential goods 
substantially all of the imports of our subsidiary in venezuela avon venezuela were classified as nonessential 
as a result of the change in the official rate to in conjunction with accounting for our operations in venezuela under highly inflationary accounting guidelines  during the first quarter of  we recorded net charges of in other expense  net and in income taxes  for a total after tax charge of  reflecting the write down of monetary assets and liabilities and deferred tax benefits 
additionally  certain nonmonetary assets must continue to be carried at us historic dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation 
therefore  the historic us dollar costs impacted the income statement during at a disproportionate rate as they had not been devalued based on the new exchange rates 
as a result of using the us historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets  such as inventory  acquired prior to the devaluation  operating profit during was negatively impacted by  for the difference between the historical cost at the previous official exchange rate of and the current official exchange rate of 
as there were no further devaluations during and  there was an immaterial impact on operating profit in and from the venezuelan currency devaluations 
currency restrictions enacted by the venezuelan government in have impacted the ability of avon venezuela to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products 
since  avon venezuela had been obtaining its foreign currency needs beyond the amounts that could be obtained at official rates through non government sources where the exchange rates were less favorable than the official rate parallel market 
in late may  the venezuelan government took control over the previously freely traded parallel market 
trading in the parallel market was suspended for several weeks in may and june and reopened as a regulated sitme market in early june the government has imposed volume restrictions on trading activity  limiting an entity s activity to a maximum of per month 
the current limit is below the monthly foreign exchange requirements of our venezuelan operations and  unless these restrictions are modified  may have a negative impact on avon venezuela s future operations 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to recover the higher cost of obtaining foreign currency in the sitme market as compared to the official rate through operating activities  such as increased pricing or cost reductions in other areas 
refer to the results of continuing operations consolidated section of this md a for discussion of the release of a provision of approximately in the fourth quarter of for the difference between the regulated sitme rate and the official exchange rate  associated with the capitalization of intercompany liabilities 
we account for venezuela as a highly inflationary economy 
at december  we had a net asset position of associated with our operations in venezuela  which included cash balances of approximately of which approximately was denominated in bol vares remeasured at the december  official exchange rate and approximately was denominated in us dollars 
of the net asset position  approximately was associated with bol var denominated monetary net assets and deferred income taxes 
additionally  during avon venezuela represented approximately of avon s consolidated revenue  of avon s consolidated operating profit  and of avon s consolidated adjusted non gaap operating profit 
during and  costs associated with acquiring goods that required settlement in us dollars included within venezuela operating profit were approximately and  respectively 
at december   avon venezuela had pending requests submitted with an agency of the venezuelan government for approximately for remittance of dividends and royalties to its parent company in the us these outstanding requests had been periodically submitted between and effective february   the venezuelan government devalued its currency by approximately 
the official exchange rate moved from to and the regulated sitme market was eliminated 
as a result of the change in the official rate to  based on a preliminary analysis  avon anticipates it will record a one time  after tax loss of approximately approximately in other expense  net and approximately in income taxes in the first quarter of  primarily reflecting the write down of monetary assets and liabilities and deferred tax benefits 
additionally  certain nonmonetary assets are carried at the us historic dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation 
therefore  these costs will impact the income statement during at a disproportionate rate as they will not be devalued based on the new exchange rates  but will be expensed at the historic dollar value 
as a result of using the us historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets  such as inventory  acquired prior to the devaluation  operating profit and net income will be negatively impacted by approximately  primarily during the first half of the year  for the difference between the historical cost at the previous official exchange rate of and the new official exchange rate of 
in addition  revenue and operating profit for avon venezuela operations will be negatively impacted when translated into dollars at the new official exchange rate 
this could be partially offset by the favorable impact of any operating performance improvements

total revenue during increased due to higher average order and growth in active representatives  as well as due to favorable foreign exchange 
average order benefited from the favorable impacts of pricing while active representatives growth benefited from continued investments in rvp

constant revenue during increased  benefiting from continued growth in most markets  particularly from growth of in mexico 
constant revenue in brazil was relatively flat 
in venezuela  revenue and constant revenue during grew 
brazil s performance during continued to be pressured by lower than normal service levels 
in addition  lower than normal service levels were further impacted by the implementation of an erp system during the second half of the year  which in turn has negatively impacted average order  active representatives  and revenue growth 
additionally  slowing beauty category market growth pressured brazil s results in the second half of while the implementation of the erp system and transformation of the related processes may negatively impact service levels in the short term  we expect the erp system to help improve our service reliability over the long term 
constant revenue growth in mexico during  was driven by an increase in active representatives and a higher average order 
revenue growth during in venezuela was the result of a higher average order primarily due to increased prices  primarily as a result of inflation

operating margin benefited 
points as compared to the prior year period from lower cti restructuring 
adjusted non gaap operating margin declined points  or points on a constant basis  primarily as a result of a decline of points due to a sharp decline in brazil s operating margin 
brazil s operating margin was partially unfavorably impacted by inventory related charges primarily due to supply chain challenges  which negatively impacted latin america s operating margin by 
points 
higher distribution costs of 
points primarily due to the transition to the new facility in brazil also contributed to the decline in operating margin 
additionally  brazil s decline in operating margin was further caused by business disruptions and resulting investments in that market  as well as inflationary pressure on costs  a decline of 
points from higher bad debt expense in countries other than brazil  and a decline of 
points from higher distribution costs in countries other than brazil  primarily due to the transition to the new facility in colombia

the table also excludes information on non binding purchase orders of inventory 
the table does not include any reserves for income taxes because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 
at december   our reserves for income taxes  including interest and penalties  totaled at december   long term debt due in excluded of private notes  of which were contractually due in  were contractually due in  and were contractually due in  and are therefore included in those respective maturity categories above 
in february  we issued a notice of prepayment of the entire outstanding principal amount of our private notes plus the make whole premium and accrued interest  which  pursuant to the notice  is required to be prepaid on march  see the capital resources private notes section below for more details 
see note  debt and other financing  and note  leases and commitments  on pages f through f  and on page f  respectively  of our annual report for further information on our debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments 
additionally  as disclosed in note  restructuring initiatives on pages f through f of our annual report  we have a remaining liability of at december   associated with the restructuring charges recorded to date under the and restructuring programs 
we also have a remaining liability of associated with other restructuring initiatives approved during  and associated with our m cost savings initiative  at december  the majority of future cash payments associated with these liabilities are expected to be made during off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
capital resources revolving credit facility we maintain a billion revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  which expires in november as discussed below  the billion available under the revolving credit facility is effectively reduced by the principal amount of any commercial paper outstanding 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate per annum equal to the floating base rate or libor  plus an applicable margin which varies within a specified band based upon our credit ratings 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  incur liens and enter into mergers and consolidations or sales of substantially all our assets  and a financial covenant which requires our interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter to equal or exceed in addition  the revolving credit facility contains customary events of default and cross default provisions 
the interest coverage ratio is determined by dividing our consolidated pre tax income by our consolidated interest expense  in each case for the period of four fiscal quarters ending on the date of determination 
on july   we obtained a waiver from the lenders under our revolving credit facility that allowed us to exclude the non cash impairment charge associated with the silpada business recorded during the fourth quarter of from the interest coverage ratio calculation pursuant to our revolving credit facility for the four fiscal quarters ended september  on december   we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility  primarily relating to the calculation of components of the interest coverage ratio that allows us  subject to certain conditions and limitations  to add back to our consolidated net income i extraordinary and other non cash losses and expenses  ii one time fees  cash charges and other cash expenses  premiums or penalties incurred in connection with any asset sale  equity issuance or incurrence or repayment of debt or refinancing or amendment of any debt instrument and iii cash charges and other cash expenses  premiums or penalties incurred in connection with any restructuring or relating to any legal or regulatory action  settlement  judgment or ruling  in an aggregate amount not to exceed for the period from october  until the termination of commitments under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   and based on then interest rates  approximately of the billion revolving credit facility  less the principal amount of commercial paper outstanding which was zero at december   could have been drawn down without violating any covenant 
if not for the more restrictive interest coverage ratio calculation under our private notes which  pursuant to a notice  is required to be prepaid on march   see below  we would have been able to draw down on the entire billion under our revolving credit facility at december  without violating any covenant 
the interest coverage ratio  under our revolving credit facility  for the four fiscal quarters ended december  was and excludes certain cash and non cash charges pursuant to the december amendment 
term loan agreement on june   we entered into a term loan agreement the term loan agreement 
subsequently on august   we borrowed an incremental of principal from subscriptions by new lenders under the term loan agreement 
at december   remained outstanding under the term loan agreement 
the term loan agreement contains covenants limiting our ability to incur liens and enter into mergers and consolidations or sales of substantially all our assets 
in addition  the term loan agreement contains financial covenants which require our interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter to equal or exceed and our leverage ratio to not be greater than at the end of each fiscal quarter on or prior to march   at the end of each fiscal quarter on or prior to december   and at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter 
the interest coverage ratio is determined by dividing our consolidated ebit as defined in the term loan agreement by our consolidated interest expense  in each case for the period of four fiscal quarters ending on the date of determination 
the leverage ratio is determined by dividing the amount of our consolidated funded debt on the date of determination by our consolidated ebitda as defined in the term loan agreement for the period of four fiscal quarters ending on the date of determination 
for purposes of calculating the ratios  consolidated ebit and consolidated ebitda are adjusted for non cash expenses 
in addition  the term loan agreement contains customary events of default and cross default provisions 
we were in compliance with our interest coverage and leverage ratios under the term loan agreement for the four fiscal quarters ended december  pursuant to the term loan agreement  we are required to repay an amount equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan on june   and the remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan on june  amounts repaid or prepaid under the term loan agreement may not be reborrowed 
borrowings under the term loan agreement bear interest  at our option  at a rate per annum equal to libor plus an applicable margin or a floating base rate plus an applicable margin  in each case subject to adjustment based on our credit ratings 
the term loan agreement also provides for mandatory prepayments and voluntary prepayments 
subject to certain exceptions including the issuance of commercial paper and draw downs on our revolving credit facility  we are required to prepay the term loan in an amount equal to of the net cash proceeds received from any incurrence of debt for borrowed money in excess of private notes on november   we issued  in a private placement exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended  principal amount of senior notes  series a  due november   principal amount of senior notes  series b  due november   and principal amount of senior notes  series c  due november  collectively  the private notes 
the private notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company  rank equal in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness  and are unconditionally guaranteed by one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the proceeds from the sale of the private notes were used to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes 
the total principal amount of the private notes were issued pursuant to a note purchase agreement that contains covenants limiting  among other things  the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness  our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens and our and any subsidiary guarantor s ability to enter into mergers and consolidations or sales of substantially all of our or its assets 
in addition  the note purchase agreement contains a financial covenant which requires our interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter to equal or exceed the interest coverage ratio is determined by dividing our consolidated pre tax income by our consolidated interest expense  in each case for the period of four fiscal quarters ending on the date of determination 
except as set forth below  the note purchase agreement does not provide for adjustments of our consolidated pre tax income for certain one time charges  such as non cash impairments  currency devaluations  or legal or regulatory settlements when calculating the interest coverage ratio 
the note purchase agreement contains customary events of default and cross default provisions and any prepayment of the private note at our option would require payment of a make whole premium 
on july   we obtained a waiver from the holders of the private notes that allowed us to exclude the non cash impairment charge associated with the silpada business recorded during the fourth quarter of from the interest coverage ratio calculation pursuant to our note purchase agreement for the four fiscal quarters ended september  on august   we entered into the first amendment to the note purchase agreement to  among other things  i add a financial covenant requiring our leverage ratio which is calculated in the same manner as in the term loan agreement to not be greater than at the end of each fiscal quarter on or prior to march   and at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter  unless a bank credit agreement or any other principal credit facility contains a leverage ratio more favorable to the holders of the private notes  then such more favorable ratio will apply for the fiscal quarters ended march  and thereafter  ii amend the interest coverage ratio to  subject to the most favored lender provision  add back to our consolidated pre tax income actual non cash impairment charges related solely to the silpada business in an amount not to exceed in the aggregate in addition to the non cash silpada impairment charge already recorded during the year end close process and excluded from the calculation for the four fiscal quarters ended september  during the term of the note purchase agreement  iii add a most favored lender provision with respect to financial covenants in favor of other lenders and iv provide a basis point step up of the applicable interest rate if our unsecured and unsubordinated debt is not rated above investment grade by a certain number of rating agencies 
we were in compliance with our interest coverage and leverage ratios under the note purchase agreement for the four fiscal quarters ended december  the interest coverage ratio under the note purchase agreement for the four fiscal quarters ended december  was and excludes the non cash silpada impairment charges pursuant to the august amendment 
in february  we issued a notice of prepayment of the entire outstanding principal amount of our private notes 
the prepayment price is equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued interest of approximately and a make whole premium estimated to be approximately the estimate of the accrued interest is based on the applicable interest rate on the notes which factors in our long term credit ratings 
the estimate of the make whole premium is based on the applicable interest rate on the notes which factors in our long term credit ratings and the prices of the relevant us treasury securities as of the date of the notice of prepayment 
accordingly  these amounts may change when we make the final calculation of the prepayment price two business days in advance of the prepayment date  which is march  public notes in march  we issued  in a public offering  principal amount of notes  due march  and principal amount of notes  due march  in march  we issued  in a public offering  principal amount of notes  due march  and principal amount of notes  due march  the proceeds from these offerings were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes 
we also have outstanding principal amount of notes  due july  and principal amount of notes  due may  commercial paper program we also maintain a billion commercial paper program  which is supported by the revolving credit facility 
under this program  we may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws  for a cumulative face amount not to exceed billion outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding days from the date of issue 
the commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment 
outstanding commercial paper effectively reduces the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
at december   there was no outstanding commercial paper under this program 
in  the demand for our commercial paper declined  partially impacted by the rating agency action described below 
additional information our long term credit ratings are baa stable outlook with moody and bbb negative outlook with s p  which are on the low end of investment grade  and bb stable outlook with fitch  which is below investment grade 
in february  fitch lowered their long term credit rating from bbb negative outlook to bb stable outlook and moody lowered their long term credit rating from baa negative outlook to baa stable outlook 
additional rating agency reviews could result in a further change in outlook or downgrade  which would likely result in an increase in financing costs  including interest expense under certain of our debt instruments  less favorable covenants and financial terms of our financing arrangements  and reduced access to lending sources  including the commercial paper market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means 
since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a portion of our existing and forecasted transactions  we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by changes in the value of the underlying transactions 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives 
the master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in some circumstances  including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of avon prior to the merger 
interest rate risk we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure 
the interest rate swaps are used to either convert our fixed rate borrowing to a variable interest rate or to unwind an existing variable interest rate swap on a fixed rate borrowing 
at december  and  we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding long term  fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rates based on libor 
our total exposure to floating interest rates was approximately at december   and at december   however  in january  we terminated interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling  our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at december   a hypothetical basis point change either an increase or a decrease in interest rates prevailing at that date  sustained for one year  would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt 
foreign currency risk we conduct business globally  with operations in various locations around the world 
over the past three years  approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the us the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is their local currency 
we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations  primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities 
at december   the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the argentine peso  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  colombian peso  the czech republic koruna  the euro  mexican peso  new zealand dollar  peruvian new sol  philippine peso  polish zloty  russian ruble  south africa rand  turkish lira  ukrainian hryvnia  and venezuelan bol var 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to  and  therefore  cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
based on our foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 
the hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at december   adjusted for an assumed appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against these hedging contracts 
credit risk of financial instruments we attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements with major international financial institutions with a or higher credit ratings as issued by standard poor s corporation 
our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts  swaps or options with major international financial institutions 
although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments  we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses  if any  would not be material 
non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would have resulted in a write off of at december  in addition  in the event of non performance by such counterparties  we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates  however  as mentioned above  in january we terminated interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling  as of the interest rate swap agreements termination date  the aggregate favorable adjustment to the carrying value of our debt was  which will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt obligations
