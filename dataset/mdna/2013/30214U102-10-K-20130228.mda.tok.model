critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements  product sales in our defense technology development practice  fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients 
substantially all of our engagements are service contracts performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
for time and material and fixed price service projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for substantially all of our fixed price service engagements  we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectability and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all contracts are subject to review by management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectability of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which in those situations would generally be upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled but recognized work in process 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions  and aging of amounts due 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues of certain items in our consolidated statements of income and the percentage increase decrease in the dollar amount of such items year to year percentage of revenues period to for fiscal years period change vs

revenues operating expenses compensation and related expenses other operating expenses reimbursable expenses general and administrative expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income executive summary revenues for fiscal increased and revenues before reimbursements increased as compared to the prior year 
this growth was due to solid overall demand for our consulting services from a diverse set of clients for both reactive and proactive projects and elevated levels of activity on a few major assignments 
we continued to work on a steady flow of reactive projects related to litigation  insurance claims and product recalls for a diverse set of clients  with significant projects in the chemical  energy and automotive sectors 
we continued to see an increase in proactive projects related to design consulting  regulatory consulting  and engineering management consulting 
we assisted consumer electronics and medical device clients in their design and manufacturing efforts 
in defense technology development  we continued to work on several projects related to the detection of improvised explosive devices 
as a result  utilization increased to as compared to during prior year 
we made progress during fiscal in several of our strategic growth areas 
in energy consulting  we continued to work on projects for several utilities and oil and gas clients to assist them with understanding why certain pipeline failures have occurred as well as the evaluation of their pipeline risk management programs 
in design consulting  we continued our work in battery consulting for a broad set of industries including consumer electronics  medical devices  automotive  aerospace  and battery suppliers 
in our environmental and health groups  we performed evaluations of the human health exposure from processes and products and environmental risk assessments for historical  existing and future operations 
during fiscal  we assisted clients with several high profile investigations that engaged consultants across many of our practices 
the growth in consulting revenues and the increase in utilization combined with moderate growth in other operating and general and administrative expenses resulted in a increase in net income to  during fiscal as compared to  during the prior year 
diluted earnings per share increased to per share as compared to during the prior year due to the increase in net income and our ongoing share repurchase program 
we were able to improve profitability and margins by effectively managing headcount over the past year to align our resources with demand and benefited from some major investigations which resulted in improved utilization and increased leverage of our cost structure 
we remain focused on selectively adding top talent and developing the skills necessary to expand upon our market position  providing clients with in depth scientific research and analysis to determine what happened and how to prevent failures or exposures in the future  capitalizing on emerging growth areas  managing other operating expenses  generating cash from operations  maintaining a strong balance sheet and undertaking activities such as share repurchases to enhance shareholder value 
we expect some of our major assignments to step down from their elevated levels of activity as they move through their project life cycle 
we also expect a step down in the level of activity in our defense technology development practice due to the constraints on defense spending and reduction of forces in afghanistan by the united states federal government

liquidity and capital resources fiscal years in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    we financed our business in fiscal through available cash and cash flows from operating activities 
we invest our excess cash in cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  compared to  at december  we believe our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  outstanding commitments  stock repurchases  dividends and other liquidity requirements over the next months 
generally  our net cash provided by operating activities is used to fund our day to day operating activities 
first quarter operating cash requirements are generally higher due to payment of our annual bonuses accrued during the prior year 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our clients 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures  leased facilities  taxes  and general operating expenses including marketing and travel 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increases in net cash provided by operating activities was due to increases in net income  increases in accrued bonuses which are paid in the year subsequent to the year accrued  and increases in non cash compensation expense partially offset by higher accounts receivable due to higher revenues 
during fiscal  and  net cash used in provided by investing activities primarily related to the purchase and sale or maturity of short term investments 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 
the increase in cash used in financing activities during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to an increase in the repurchase of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including capital expenditures

as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal

non gaap financial measures regulation g  conditions for use of non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company performance  financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we closely monitor two financial measures  ebitda and ebitdas  which meet the definition of non gaap financial measures 
we define ebitda as net income before income taxes  interest income  depreciation and amortization 
we define ebitdas as ebitda before stock based compensation 
we regard ebitda and ebitdas as useful measures of operating performance and cash flow to complement operating income  net income and other gaap financial performance measures 
additionally  management believes that ebitda and ebitdas provide meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results 
these measures are used to evaluate our financial results  develop budgets and determine employee compensation 
these measures  however  should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute or superior to  operating income  cash flows  or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of the non gaap measures to the nearest comparable gaap measure is set forth below 
the following table shows ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal years  and in thousands  except percentages fiscal years revenues before reimbursements    ebitda    ebitda as a of revenues before reimbursements the increase in ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in utilization  combined with other operating and general and administrative expenses growing at a slower rate than revenues 
utilization during fiscal was strong due to broad based demand for our services and the continuing benefit from a few major assignments 
utilization for fiscal increased to as compared to during fiscal the increase in ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in utilization and our efforts to manage our cost structure 
utilization for fiscal increased to as compared to during fiscal due to elevated levels of activity on a few major assignments 
the following table is a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitdas to the most comparable gaap measure  net income  for fiscal  and in thousands fiscal years net income    add back subtract income taxes    interest income  net depreciation and amortization    ebitda    stock based compensation    ebitdas    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points  the change in the fair value of our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
