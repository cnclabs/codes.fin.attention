item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about fluidigm and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described in risk factors in item a of this form k  in this item  and elsewhere in this form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview we develop  manufacture  and market microfluidic systems for growth markets  such as single cell genomics  applied genotyping  and sample preparation for targeted resequencing  in the life science and agricultural biotechnology  or ag bio  industries 
our proprietary microfluidic systems consist of instruments and consumables  including ifcs  assays  and other reagents 
our systems are designed to significantly simplify experimental workflow  increase throughput and reduce costs  while providing the excellent data quality demanded by our customers 
in addition  our proprietary technology enables genetic analysis that in many instances was previously impractical 
we actively market four microfluidic systems  including different ifcs for nucleic acid analysis  and three families of assay chemistries  to leading academic institutions  clinical laboratories  and pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and ag bio companies 
we have sold approximately systems to customers in over countries worldwide 
we have launched several product lines  including our biomark system for gene expression analysis  genotyping  and digital polymerase chain reaction  or digital pcr  in  our ep system for single nucleotide polymorphism  or snp  genotyping  and digital pcr in  our access array system for target enrichment in  our biomark hd real time pcr system for high throughput gene expression analysis  targeted single cell gene expression analysis  snp genotyping  and digital pcr in  and our c single cell auto prep system for single cell sample preparation for single cell analysis in june in addition  in may  we launched assay products  including our deltagene assays for gene expression  our snptype assays for snp genotyping  and our access array target specific primers for targeted next generation dna sequencing 
our systems utilize one or more ifcs designed for particular applications and include specialized instrumentation and software  as well as assays and other reagents for certain applications 
we distribute our microfluidic systems through our direct sales force and support organizations located in north america  europe  and asia pacific  and through distributors or sales agents in several european  latin american  middle eastern  and asia pacific countries 
our manufacturing operations are primarily located in singapore 
our facility in singapore manufactures our instruments and fabricates all of our ifcs for commercial sale and for our research and development purposes 
our south san francisco facility fabricates ifcs for our research and development purposes  and manufactures our assays and produces other reagents for commercial sale 
from through  we have received revenue from government grants 
our most significant grant relationship has been with the singapore economic development board  or edb 
the edb  an agency of the government of singapore  promotes research  development  and manufacturing activities in singapore and associated employment of singapore nationals by providing incentive grants to companies conducting operations in singapore that satisfy the requirements of edb s government programs 
under our agreements with edb  we were eligible to receive incentive grant payments from edb  provided we satisfied certain agreed upon targets 
our agreements with edb provided for incentive funding eligibility through may from january  through december   we recognized million of grant revenue from edb 

table of contents we have grown our total revenue from million in to million in we have incurred significant net losses since our inception in and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs  and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in accounting estimates may occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of our products  license and collaboration arrangements  and government grants 
our products consist of instruments and consumables  including ifcs  assays and other reagents  related to our microfluidic systems 
product revenue includes services for instrument installation  training  and customer support services 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sales of our products that are not part of multiple element arrangements are recognized when no significant obligation remains undelivered and collection is reasonably assured  which is generally when delivery has occurred 
delivery occurs when there is a transfer of title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are classified as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet 
the evaluation of these revenue recognition criteria requires significant management judgment 
for instance  we use judgment to assess collectability based on factors such as the customer s creditworthiness and past collection history  if applicable 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 
we also use judgment to assess whether a price is fixed or determinable  including  but not limited to  reviewing contractual terms and conditions related to payment 
certain of our sales contracts involve the delivery or performance of multiple products or services 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for revenue from multiple element arrangements  including whether the deliverables should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  how the related sales price should be allocated among the elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract 
for sales contracts that include multiple deliverables  we allocate the contract consideration at the inception of the contract to each unit of accounting based upon their relative selling prices 
we may use our best estimate 
table of contents of selling price for individual deliverables when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is unavailable 
a delivered item is considered to be a separate unit of accounting when it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
our products  other than for service contracts  are delivered within a short time frame  generally within one to three months  of the contract date 
service contracts are entered into for one to two year terms  following the expiration of the warranty period 
for transactions entered into prior to that include multiple elements  we allocated revenue to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value  and recognized revenue for each unit of accounting when the applicable revenue recognition criteria were met 
when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not for the delivered items  the residual method was used to allocate arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
when we were unable to establish stand alone value for delivered items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been established  revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed  or until fair value could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
our products are sold without the right of return 
accruals for estimated warranty expenses are provided at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
we use judgment to estimate these accruals and  if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our products under warranty were greater than our estimates  our cost of product revenue could be adversely affected in future periods 
we have entered into license and collaboration agreements with third parties that generally provide us with up front and periodic milestone payments 
revenue from license agreements is recognized when received  upfront payments are generally recognized over the term of the underlying agreement and milestone payments are generally recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the agreement 
revenue from government grants relates to the achievement of agreed upon milestones and expenditures and is recognized in the period in which the related costs are incurred  provided that the conditions under which the government grants are awarded have been substantially met and only perfunctory obligations remain outstanding 
with respect to the edb grants  upon satisfaction of grant conditions  we received incentive grant payments equal to a portion of qualifying expenses we incurred in singapore 
qualifying expenses included salaries  overhead  outsourcing and subcontracting expenses  operating expenses  and raw material purchases 
royalties paid are not qualifying expenses under the incentive grant program 
we submitted requests to the edb for incentive grant payments on a quarterly basis  which were subject to the edb s review and our satisfaction of the grant conditions 
our first grant agreement with the edb was completed in july  at which time we submitted our final progress report and evidence of achievement of our development targets under the letter agreement 
in october  we received confirmation from edb that all of our obligations under the first grant had been met and  in october  we received our final grant payment relating thereto 
our second grant agreement with the edb was completed in may based on correspondence with edb  we believe we have satisfied our obligations applicable to our edb grant revenue through december  changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines as well as changes in facts and circumstances could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
stock based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and restricted stock units  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of options on the grant date is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of 
table of contents certain subjective assumptions  including expected term  volatility  risk free interest rate and the fair value of our common stock 
these assumptions generally require significant judgment 
our board of directors sets the terms  conditions  and restrictions related to the grant of stock options and restricted stock units  including the number of shares underlying the grants and the vesting criteria 
with respect to performance based stock options  depending on the extent to which the vesting criteria are met  our board of directors determines the number of shares that vest under the grants 
the resulting costs of our equity awards  net of estimated forfeitures  are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually a time based vesting period 
we amortize the fair value of stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods 
for performance based stock options  we recognize stock based compensation over the requisite service periods using the accelerated attribution method 
our common stock has a limited trading history because our common stock was not publicly traded until our initial public offering  or ipo  in february accordingly  the expected volatility of our common stock is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the life science industry 
when selecting our industry peer companies  we consider our stage of development  size  and financial leverage 
these historical volatilities are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon us treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to each grant s expected life 
we estimate the expected lives of employee options using the simplified method as the midpoint of the expected time to vest and the contractual term 
the calculated fair value of our stock options could change significantly if we determine that another method is more reasonable  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance 
higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase in stock based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense affects our cost of product revenue  research and development expense  and selling  general and administrative expense 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover behavior  and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments was insignificant during   and we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rate related to our stock based compensation 
also required to compute the fair value calculation of options is the fair value of the underlying common stock 
we grant stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
prior to our ipo  our board of directors obtained contemporaneous valuations from an unrelated third party valuation firm to determine the estimated fair value of common stock based on an analysis of relevant metrics  such as the price of the most recent convertible preferred stock sales to outside investors  the rights  preferences  and privileges of the convertible preferred stock  our operating and financial performance  the hiring of key personnel  the introduction of new products  the lack of marketability of the common stock  and additional factors relating to our business 
there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we or the valuation firm had made different assumptions  the amount of our stock based compensation expense  net loss  and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different 
following the completion of our ipo in february  
table of contents the fair value of options granted is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as quoted on the nasdaq global market 
historically  certain of our stock options were granted to officers  with vesting acceleration features based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones 
the timing of the attainment of these milestones affected the timing of expense recognition since we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of stock options that are expected to vest 
we recorded stock based compensation of million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation costs  which are expected to be recognized over an average period of three years 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our provision for income taxes generally consists of tax expense benefit related to current period earnings losses 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we continuously monitor the circumstances impacting the expected realization of our deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction 
we consider all available evidence  including historical operating results in each jurisdiction  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
to the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized  a valuation allowance is established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support its reduction 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
changes in these estimates may result in significant increases or decreases to our tax provision in a period in which such estimates are changed  which in turn would affect net income or loss 
we recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax provision 
effective january   we obtained approval for pioneer tax status in singapore 
we do not expect this status to have a material impact on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we cannot predict whether pioneer tax status will have a material impact on our business  operating results  or financial condition in future periods because the availability of the tax incentives will depend entirely on the long term development of our business 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete  slow moving  or impaired goods in order to state inventory at its net realizable value 
the business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and 
table of contents quality issues  historical experience  and our current inventory levels 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
results of operations revenue we generate revenue from sales of our products  license and collaboration agreements  and government grants 
our product revenue consists of sales of instruments and related services  and consumables  including ifcs  assays and other reagents 
we have entered into license and collaboration agreements and have received government grants to conduct research and development activities 
the following table presents our revenue by source for each period presented in thousands year ended december  revenue instruments consumables product revenue license and collaboration revenue grant revenue total revenue the following table presents our product revenue by geography and as a percentage of total product revenue by geography based on the billing address of our customers for each period presented in thousands year ended december  united states europe japan asia pacific other total grant revenue is received from our incentive grants with the edb and the california institute of regenerative medicine  or cirm 
grant revenue from cirm is generated in the united states and grant revenue with the edb was generated in singapore 
license and collaboration revenue is primarily generated in the united states 
our customers include academic research institutions  clinical laboratories  and pharmaceutical  biotechnology and ag bio companies worldwide 
total revenue from our five largest customers in each of the periods presented comprised   and of revenue in   and  respectively 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  total revenue total revenue increased by million  or  to million for as compared to million for 
table of contents product revenue product revenue increased by million  or  to million for as compared to million for  reflecting increased revenue from sales of instruments and consumables 
consumables revenue increased by million  or  primarily due to increased sales of genotyping and gene expression ifcs  and to a lesser extent  access array ifcs and assays 
ifc sales growth was driven by increases in the installed base of our instrument systems  analytical chip pull through  and to a lesser extent  by higher ifc average selling prices 
instrument revenue increased by million  or  primarily due to the launch of our c single cell auto prep system during the third quarter of  and increased sales of our service offerings and aftermarket instruments 
this was partially offset by decreased unit sales of the access array system and  to a much lesser extent  decreased unit sales of our analytical systems 
we expect unit sales of both instruments and consumables to continue to increase in future periods as we continue our efforts to grow our customer base and expand our geographic market coverage 
however  we expect the average selling prices of our instruments to fluctuate over time based on product mix 
license and collaboration revenue license and collaboration revenue decreased by million to million for as compared to million for due to the termination of the collaboration agreement with novartis vaccines diagnostics  inc novartis v d on may  the collaboration agreement with novartis v d was entered into in may to develop a new product and received an up front payment of million 
additionally  the collaboration agreement provided for payments to us upon the achievement of multiple defined milestones related to the design and development of product prototypes 
in march  we entered into an amendment to the collaboration agreement and received an additional million 
under the amendment  certain milestones were modified and payment terms related to this agreement associated with satisfaction of the milestones were revised 
during  we recognized million of milestone revenue related to this agreement 
all our performance obligations under this agreement were satisfied at december  and there were no other agreements with potential future milestones 
grant revenue grant revenue consists of incentive grants from government entities  including edb and cirm 
grant revenue increased million to million for  compared to million for the increase relates to our cirm grant as the grant from the edb was completed in may under our incentive grant agreements with edb  we received incentive grant payments equal to a portion of qualifying expenses we incurred in singapore 
we incurred million of qualifying expenses in our agreements with edb provided that grants extended to us were subject to certain grant conditions and provided edb with the right to demand repayment of a portion of past grants in the event that we did not meet our obligations under the applicable agreements 
based on correspondence with edb  we believe we have satisfied our obligations applicable to our edb grant revenue through december  our first cirm grant was awarded in in the amount of million and was earned over a two year period 
our second cirm grant was awarded in in the amount of million to be earned over a three year period 
the cirm grant revenue is recognized as the related research and development services are performed and costs associated with the grants are recognized as research and development expense during the period incurred 
we expect total grant revenue for to be consistent with as our grant revenue from cirm to design and develop prototype microfluidic systems for use in stem cell research continues 

table of contents cost of product revenue the following table presents our cost of product revenue and product margin for each period presented in thousands 
year ended december  december  cost of product revenue product margin cost of product revenue includes manufacturing costs incurred in the production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  installation  packaging  and delivery costs 
in addition  cost of product revenue includes royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products  warranty  service  provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory  and stock based compensation expense 
costs related to license  collaboration and grant revenue are included in research and development expense 
cost of product revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for due to increased product sales in cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue decreased to for compared to for this improvement was primarily due to a higher product mix of higher margin consumables relative to instruments systems  lower consumables manufacturing costs resulting from higher production volumes and yield improvements  a shift to higher margin instruments within the instrument systems product line  and lower product material costs for analytical systems and the access array system 
these improvements were offset in part by higher freight and distribution costs 
operating expenses the following table presents our operating expenses for each period presented in thousands year ended december  december  research and development selling  general and administrative litigation settlement total operating expenses research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs  independent contractor costs  prototype and material expenses and other allocated facilities and information technology expenses 
we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception 
our research and development efforts have focused primarily on enhancing our technologies and to support development and commercialization of new and existing products and services 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs and related expenses  including stock based compensation  of million  lab supplies and equipment costs of million  and outside services of million 
these increased costs were in support of our development and commercialization of new and existing products and services 
we believe that our continued investment in research and development is essential to our long term competitive position and we expect these expenses to increase in future periods 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing  business development  finance  legal  human resources and general management  as well as professional services  such as legal and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs and related expenses  including stock based compensation  of million  an increase in sales and marketing activities of million  an increase in accounting and outside services of million  and an increase in facility expenses of million 
the increase was primarily driven by expansion of worldwide commercial capabilities to support our growth and compliance costs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expense to increase in future periods as we continue to grow our sales  technical support  marketing  and administrative headcount  support increased product sales  broaden our customer base  and incur additional costs to support our expanding global footprint and the overall growth in our business 
litigation settlement on june   we settled certain litigation and entered into a series of patent license agreements resulting in a net million payment by us to life technologies corporation and its applied biosystems  llc subsidiary  referred to as life 
the payment was recognized as litigation settlement expense in our consolidated statement of operations because the amount paid by us was principally attributable to resolving life s litigation claims against us with respect to a specific expiring us patent and its foreign counterparts 
under the terms of the agreements  each party had the option  exercisable for thirty days from the date of the agreements  to limit or preclude certain patent litigation between the parties over a period of two to four years 
these rights were subject to certain exceptions and required an additional payment by the party exercising the option at the time of exercise 
in july  we exercised our option and paid life million 
as a result  subject to certain exceptions  life may not initiate litigation under its patents existing as of june  against our customers for two years and against us  with respect to our current products and equivalent future products  for four years 
the additional payment was recorded in other assets and is being amortized to selling  general and administrative expense over four years on a straight line basis beginning in july the additional payment is being amortized to selling  general and administrative expense because it precludes life from initiating litigation under its relevant patents for any alleged prior and future infringement by us for four years  and because such preclusion relates to our equivalent future products 
life elected not to exercise its option 
litigation settlement expense was million for as a result of the agreements entered into with life on june  we had no similar agreement in

conversely  we incur  or have incurred  interest expense from our bank line of credit  long term debt  convertible promissory notes and the amortization of debt discounts related to our long term debt and convertible promissory notes 
until the closing of our ipo  we also recognized income or expense as a result of changes in the fair value of outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock

there was no similar transaction or recognition of expense in the decrease also resulted from a reduction in the principal amount of our long term debt beginning in march  when we began making principal and interest payments totaling million per month 
as required under our loan agreement  we made an additional principal payment of million in march in june  we elected to make another principal payment of million using proceeds from our line of credit 
in august and september  we elected to pay the remaining million balance due under the loan agreement 
prior to our ipo  the fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability increased resulting in a loss of million in we did not have any outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants during as all convertible preferred stock warrants were either converted into warrants to purchase common stock  or expired unexercised  or were exercised for shares of our common stock upon the closing of our ipo in february upon the closing of our ipo  liabilities related to the expired warrants were reversed  resulting in a gain of million during liabilities related to the warrants that were converted into warrants to purchase common stock and warrants that were exercised in connection with our ipo were reclassified to additional paid in capital 
deemed dividend in january  we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to decrease the conversion price of our series e convertible preferred stock from to per share 
as a result  we recognized a deemed dividend of million  reflecting the fair value of the additional shares of common stock to be issued as a result of the change in conversion price of the series e convertible preferred stock 
the deemed dividend increased the net loss attributed to common stockholders in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share

under the terms of the agreements  each party had the option  exercisable for thirty days from the date of the agreements  to limit or preclude certain patent litigation between the parties over a period of two to four years 
these rights were subject to certain exceptions and required an additional payment by the party exercising the option at the time of exercise 
in july  we exercised our option and paid life million 
as a result  subject to certain exceptions  life may not initiate litigation under its patents existing as of june  against our customers for two years and against us  with respect to our current products and equivalent future products  for four years 
the additional payment was recorded in other assets and is being amortized to selling  general and administrative expense over four years on a straight line basis beginning in july the additional payment is being amortized to selling  general and administrative expense because it precludes life from initiating litigation under its relevant patents for any alleged prior and future infringement by us for four years  and because such preclusion relates to our equivalent future products 
life elected not to exercise its option

we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
however  we may experience lower than expected cash generated from operating activities or greater than expected capital expenditures  cost of revenue or operating expenses  and we may need to raise additional capital to expand the commercialization of our products  expand and fund our operations  further our research and development activities  or acquire or invest in a business 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including market acceptance of our products  the cost of our research and development activities  the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications  the cost associated with litigation or disputes relating to intellectual property rights  or otherwise  the cost and timing of regulatory clearances or approvals  if any  the cost and timing of establishing additional sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost and timing of establishing additional technical support capabilities  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
in the future  we may acquire businesses or technologies from third parties  and we may decide to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to the extent we believe this is necessary to successfully complete these acquisitions 
we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any such acquisitions 
if we require additional funds in the future  we may not be able to obtain such funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt 
any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are unable to raise adequate funds  we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets  or delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our development programs 
if we do not have  or are not able to obtain  sufficient funds  we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize 
we also may have to reduce marketing  customer support  research and development  or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk as we expand internationally our results of operations and cash flows will become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our revenue is generally denominated in the local currency of the contracting party 
historically  the substantial majority of our revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located  which is primarily in the united states  with a portion of expenses incurred in singapore where our manufacturing facility is located 
our results of operations and cash flows are  therefore  subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
the effect of a adverse change in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated cash  receivables and payables as of december  and december  would not have been material 

table of contents to date  we have not entered into any material foreign currency hedging contracts although we may do so in the future 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  these amounts were held primarily in cash on deposit with banks  money market funds  and us government agency securities  which are short term 
we had million in investments at december  held primarily in us government agency securities 
the contractual maturity periods of million of our investments are within one year from december  the contractual maturity periods of our remaining investments are less than two years 
cash and cash equivalents and investments are held for working capital purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates had decreased by during the periods presented  our interest income would not have been materially affected 
fair value of financial instruments we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we may adopt specific hedging strategies in the future
