item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results  included herein 

table of contents denbury resources inc title to properties customarily in the oil and natural gas industry  only a perfunctory title examination is conducted at the time properties believed to be suitable for drilling operations are first acquired 
prior to commencement of drilling operations  a thorough drill site title examination is normally conducted  and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects 
typically  in connection with acquisitions  title reviews are performed on selected higher value properties 
we believe that we have good title to our oil and natural gas properties  some of which are subject to encumbrances  easements and restrictions which we do not believe are material to our operations 
significant oil and gas purchasers and product marketing oil and gas sales are made on a day to day basis under short term contracts at the current area market price 
the loss of any single purchaser would not be expected to have a material adverse effect upon our operations  however  the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production  which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive 
for the years ended december   and  two purchasers accounted for or more of our oil and natural gas revenues marathon petroleum company llc  and in  and  respectively and plains marketing lp  and in  and  respectively 
our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas  the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines  the available capacity in such pipelines  the demand for oil and natural gas  the effects of weather  and the effects of state and federal regulation 
our production in the gulf coast region is primarily from developed fields close to major pipelines or refineries and established infrastructure 
our production in the rocky mountain region is dependent on  among other factors  limited transportation options caused by oversubscribed pipelines and market centers that are distant from producing properties 
as of december   we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets  however  there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices 
oil marketing over the past couple of years  the oil produced in the gulf coast region has benefited from strong pricing differentials in relation to nymex and  where possible  we have attached our production to louisiana light sweet lls pricing 
during and  our light sweet oil production in this area  on average  sold for more than per bbl over nymex 
the light and medium sour crude production has also benefited from the continued strength of other gulf coast grades relative to nymex  with production in selling at a premium to nymex of per bbl 
historically  lls pricing and nymex pricing have been much closer together than the spread we have experienced over the last two years 
the market dynamics of the region suggest the possibility of divergence from the current premiums currently being realized due to the influx of light sweet crude and condensate from producing regions outside of the gulf coast region by rail and publicly announced major pipeline projects 
our current markets  at various sales points along the gulf coast  have sufficient demand to accommodate our production  but there can be no assurance of future demand  and we are therefore monitoring the marketplace for opportunities to strategically enter into long term marketing arrangements 
the marketing of our rocky mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to market centers in guernsey  wyoming  clearbrook  minnesota  and wood river  illinois 
shipments on some of the pipelines are oversubscribed and subject to apportionment 
we have currently been allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production  however  there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future 
expansion of pipeline and newly built rail infrastructure in the rocky mountain region is ongoing and  we believe  has increased stability of oil differentials in the area  although recent events resulting in wider than usual differentials in the current markets are expected to remain in place until incremental takeaway capacity comes on line 
for the year ended december   the discount for our oil production in the rocky mountain region averaged per bbl  compared to per bbl during excluding the bakken area assets that we sold during the fourth quarter of  our oil production in the rocky mountain region sold at a discount to nymex of per bbl during the year ended december  
table of contents denbury resources inc overall  during  we sold approximately of our crude oil at prices based on the lls index price  approximately at prices partially tied to the lls index price  and the balance at prices based on various other indexes tied to nymex prices  primarily in the rocky mountain region 
on a pro forma basis excluding bakken area assets sold in  we sold approximately of our crude oil at prices based on the lls index price and approximately at prices partially tied to the lls index price 
natural gas marketing virtually all of our natural gas production in the gulf coast region is close to existing pipelines  consequently  we generally have a variety of options to market our natural gas 
our gas production in the rocky mountain region  like our oil production  is dependent on  among other factors  limited transportation options that can affect our ability to find markets for it 
we sell the majority of our natural gas on one year contracts  with prices fluctuating month to month based on published pipeline indices and with slight premiums or discounts to the index 
we currently receive near nymex or henry hub prices for most of our natural gas sales in mississippi 
for the year ended december   the amount received per mcf for our mississippi natural gas production was consistent with nymex prices 
in the texas gulf coast region  due primarily to its location  the price we received for the year ended december  averaged per mcf below nymex prices 
the rocky mountain region natural gas production is sold at the wellhead on a percent of proceeds basis 
we receive a percentage of proceeds on both the residue natural gas volumes and the natural gas liquids volumes 
the natural gas has a significant component of propane  butanes and other higher density hydrocarbons  resulting in a measurable natural gas liquids stream 
for the year ended december   we averaged per mcf over nymex prices for our rocky mountain region natural gas production due primarily to the natural gas liquids extracted from the gas stream  improving the net price we receive 
helium marketing we expect production to commence at riley ridge field in mid  after which we expect to begin to supply helium to a third party purchaser under a year helium supply arrangement 
helium will be sold under the contract at a price that will fluctuate based on helium deliveries  cpi and other factors over the year term 
competition and markets we face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business including acquisition of producing properties  oil and gas leases  and co properties  marketing of oil and natural gas  and obtaining goods  services and labor 
many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources 
factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity  available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments 
gathering systems are the only practical method for the intermediate transportation of natural gas 
therefore  competition for natural gas delivery is presented by other pipelines and gas gathering systems 
competition is also presented to a lesser extent by alternative fuel sources  including heating oil and other fossil fuels 
because of the primary nature of our core assets our tertiary operations and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of co in the gulf coast and rocky mountain regions  we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain aspects of our business 
the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations and for geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices  causing periodic shortages in such personnel 
in recent years  the competition for qualified technical personnel has been extensive and our personnel costs have been escalating at a rate higher than general inflation 
there have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment  as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled 
these factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment  services and personnel 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
we cannot be certain when we will experience these issues  and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin  cash flow and operating results or restrict our ability to drill those wells and conduct those operations that we currently have planned and budgeted 

table of contents denbury resources inc federal and state regulations numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry 
additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this evolving regulatory burden is often difficult and costly  and substantial penalties may be incurred for noncompliance 
the following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us 
we cannot predict the impact of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us 
the future annual cost of complying with the regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be governed by several factors  including future changes to regulatory requirements 
however  management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  although compliance and regulatory approval could cause delays or otherwise impede operations 
regulation of natural gas and oil exploration and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for drilling wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include regulation of the size of drilling  spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units  and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws  which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells  generally prohibit or restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
the effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our costs of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
federal regulation of sales prices and transportation the transportation and certain sales of natural gas in interstate commerce are heavily regulated by agencies of the us federal government and are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
in particular  the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive us federal and state regulation 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting the natural gas industry 
some of ferc s proposals may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines 
while our sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to ferc regulation  our ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on certain pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to ferc regulation 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by congress  ferc  state regulatory bodies and the courts 
we cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective and their effect  if any  on our operations 
federal energy and climate change legislation and regulation in early  the president signed the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty and job creation act of this act  among other things  updates federal pipeline safety standards  increases penalties for violations of such standards  gives the department of transportation the dot authority for new damage prevention and incident notification  and directs the dot to prescribe new minimum safety standards for co pipelines  which safety standards could affect our operations and the costs thereof 
the dot has not yet promulgated any such new minimum safety standards 
in the future  congress may create new incentives for alternative energy sources and may also consider legislation to reduce emissions of co or other greenhouse gases 
if enacted  such legislation could impose a tax or other economic penalty on the production of fossil fuels that  when used  ultimately release co  reduce the demand for  and uses of  oil  gas and other minerals  and or increase the costs incurred by us in our exploration and production activities 
the environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations requiring permitting for certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions  along with requirements for wells used for geologic sequestration 
at 
table of contents denbury resources inc the same time  legislation to reduce the emissions of co or other greenhouse gases could also create economic incentives for technologies and practices that reduce or avoid such emissions  including processes that sequester co in geologic formations such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs 
natural gas gathering regulations state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements 
although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future 
federal  state or indian leases our operations on federal  state or indian oil and gas leases  especially those in the rocky mountains  are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  the bureau of ocean energy management  the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement  the bureau of indian affairs  and other federal and state stakeholder agencies 
environmental regulations public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
our oil and natural gas production  saltwater disposal operations  injection of co  and the processing  handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm are subject to stringent regulation 
we could incur significant costs  including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product  third party claims for property damage and personal injuries  or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental or other laws applicable to our operations 
changes in  or more stringent enforcement of  environmental laws and other laws applicable to our operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures 
various federal  state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment directly impact our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations 
these include  among others  regulations adopted by the epa and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  property contamination including groundwater contamination  and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination  the clean air act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on air emissions from our operations  including those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that  when used  ultimately release co  the oil pollution act of  which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of  and response to  oil spills into waters of the united states  the resource conservation and recovery act  which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes  the endangered species act and counterpart state legislation  which protects endangered and threatened species and their related habitats including certain species  which could be present on our leases  as threatened or endangered  and state regulations and statutes governing the handling  treatment  storage and disposal of norm 
management believes that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  although such laws and regulations  and compliance therewith  could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations  which may cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated 
hydraulic fracturing we previously used a hydraulic fracturing process to stimulate production in our bakken area and selma chalk properties 
we sold our bakken area properties during the fourth quarter of and have no current plans to hydraulically fracture any of our remaining oil and gas wells  including our selma chalk properties  during during  we fracture stimulated operated wells in the bakken utilizing water based fluids with no diesel fuel component 
in these operations  we are cognizant of environmental laws and continually monitor all of our operations for possible environmental impact

oil and natural gas reserves estimates d m prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december   and see the summary of d m s report as of december   included as an exhibit to this form k 
these estimates of reserves were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month within the month period in accordance with rules and regulations of the sec 
these oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist  nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage 
the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 
during  we provided oil and gas reserve estimates for to the united states energy information agency  which were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our form k for the year ended december  our proved nonproducing reserves primarily relate to reserves that are to be recovered from productive zones that are currently behind pipe 
since a majority of our properties are in areas with multiple pay zones  these properties typically have both proved producing and proved nonproducing reserves 
as of december   our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately mmboe  or approximately of our estimated total proved reserves  a decline of mmboe from december  levels 
our proved undeveloped oil reserves primarily relate to our co tertiary operations mmboe and our proved undeveloped natural gas reserves are primarily located in our riley ridge field mmboe acquired in and our december  proved undeveloped reserves also include mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at our cca fields acquired in and mmboe of 
table of contents denbury resources inc proved undeveloped reserves we acquired at thompson field during we consider the co tertiary proved undeveloped reserves to be lower risk than other proved undeveloped reserves that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production  because all of these proved undeveloped reserves are associated with tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production 
during  we spent approximately million to convert mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves were converted primarily through the expansion of our tertiary floods mmboe and through additional drilling in the bakken 
during  proved undeveloped reserve additions of mmboe  primarily related to the initial recognition of reserves associated with new tertiary floods mmboe and the acquisition of thompson field mmboe  were partially offset by the decrease in proved undeveloped reserves resulting from the sale of our bakken area assets mmboe 
as of december   mmboe of our total proved undeveloped reserves are not scheduled to be developed within five years of initial booking  all of which are part of co eor projects 
we believe these reserves satisfy the conditions to be included as proved reserves because we have established and continue to follow the previously adopted development plan for each of these projects  we have significant ongoing development activities in each of these co eor projects and we have an historical record of completing the development of comparable long term projects

pv value is a non gaap measure and is different from the standardized measure in that pv value is a pre tax number and the standardized measure is an after tax number 
the information used to calculate pv value is derived directly from 
table of contents denbury resources inc data determined in accordance with fasc topic the difference between these two amounts  the discounted estimated future income tax in thousands was  at december    at december   and  at december  we believe that pv value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure because the standardized measure can be impacted by a company s unique tax situation  and it is not practical to calculate the standardized measure on a property by property basis 
because of this  pv value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts  banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties 
pv value is commonly used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold and to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and gas properties 
pv value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under gaap  nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure 
our pv value and the standardized measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
see glossary and selected abbreviations for the definition of pv value and see note  supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures unaudited  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures about the standardized measure 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond our control 
see item a  risk factors estimating our reserves  production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty 
see also note  supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures unaudited  to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
risk factors oil and natural gas prices are volatile 
a substantial decrease in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our financial results 
our future financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future  especially given current world geopolitical conditions 
oil and natural gas prices have continued their volatility between year end and year end  with nymex oil prices per bbl decreasing  and nymex natural gas prices per mmbtu increasing by 
future decreases in commodity prices could require us to record full cost ceiling test write downs 
the amount of any future write down is difficult to predict and will depend upon oil and natural gas prices  the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent 
our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas 
this price volatility also affects the amount of our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
oil prices are likely to affect us more than natural gas prices because oil comprised approximately of our production and of our december  proved reserves  with oil being an even larger percentage of our current production and future potential reserves and projects due to our primary focus on tertiary operations 
the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the supply of  and demand for  these commodities  which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors  including the level of worldwide consumer demand for oil and natural gas  the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  domestic governmental regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuel sources  storage levels of oil and natural gas  weather conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the gulf of mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations  and winter conditions and forest fires in the rocky mountains that can delay or impede operations  market uncertainty  worldwide political events and conditions  including actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations  and 
table of contents denbury resources inc worldwide economic conditions 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements 
also  prices for oil and prices for natural gas do not necessarily move in tandem 
declines in oil and natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue  but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
if the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines  we may  among other things  be unable to meet our financial obligations or make planned expenditures 
over the past five years oil prices have fluctuated significantly  reaching record highs of approximately per bbl in july  declining precipitously during the last half of  and ending that year at a nymex price of per bbl 
oil prices then reversed course  generally increasing through the past several years  ending at a nymex price of per bbl and ending at a nymex price of per bbl 
due to the volatility of oil prices  oil prices could decline to a level that makes our tertiary projects uneconomical 
if that were to happen  we may decide to suspend future expansion projects  and if prices were to drop below the cash break even point for an extended period of time  we may decide to shut in existing production  both of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may also be required to reduce our capital expenditures in the event of reduced commodity prices to reflect the reduced cash flow  which could reduce or eliminate our growth 
we have a practice of hedging approximately to months from the current quarter of forecasted production to mitigate the risks associated with price fluctuations see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding our commodity derivative contracts 
as of february   we have oil commodity derivative contracts in place covering approximately  bbls d during and  bbls d during since operating costs do not decrease as quickly as commodity prices  it is difficult to determine a precise break even point for our tertiary projects 
based on prior history  we estimate our economic break even point before corporate overhead  and based on expenses on these projects at current oil prices occurs at per barrel dollar costs in the per barrel range  depending on the specific field and area 
the prices we receive for our crude oil often do not correlate with nymex prices 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production can vary from nymex oil prices depending on  among other factors  the quality of the crude oil we sell  the location of our crude oil production and the related markets to which we sell  variations in prices paid based upon different indices used  and the pricing contracts and indices at which we sell production 
our nymex differentials on a field by field basis over the last few years have ranged from approximately per bbl above nymex to approximately per bbl below nymex 
on a corporate wide basis  our nymex differentials over the last few years have ranged from approximately per bbl above nymex oil prices to approximately per bbl below nymex oil prices 
these variances have been due to various factors and are difficult to forecast or anticipate  but they have a direct impact on the net oil price we receive 
natural gas price volatility has followed a different path during the last few years  with current prices depressed as a result of weak demand and significant natural gas storage in place  leading to excess gas supply 
nymex natural gas prices averaged per mmbtu during  per mmbtu during  and per mmbtu during  and ended at per mmbtu 
as of february   we do not have any natural gas commodity derivative contracts in place 
our production will decline if our access to sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide is limited 
our long term growth strategy is focused on our co tertiary recovery operations 
the crude oil production from our tertiary recovery projects depends on having access to sufficient amounts of co our ability to produce this oil would be hindered if our supply of co were limited due to problems with our current co producing wells and facilities  including compression equipment  or catastrophic pipeline failure 
our anticipated future crude oil production is also dependent on our ability to increase the production volumes of co and inject adequate amounts of co into the proper formation and area within each oil field 
the production of crude oil from tertiary operations is highly dependent on the timing  volumes and location of the co injections 
if our crude oil production were to decline  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our planned tertiary operations and the related construction of necessary co pipelines could be delayed by difficulties in obtaining pipeline rights of way  permits  or by the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered 
the production of crude oil from our planned tertiary operations is also dependent upon having access to pipelines to transport available co to our oil fields at a cost that is economically viable 
our ongoing construction of co pipelines will require us to 
table of contents denbury resources inc obtain rights of way not only from private landowners  but in certain areas  from the federal government if the proposed pipelines cross federal lands 
certain states where we operate are considering the adoption of laws and regulations that would limit or eliminate a state s ability to exercise eminent domain over private property  in addition to possible judicially imposed constraints on  and additional requirements for  the exercise of eminent domain 
we also conduct operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases that have species  such as the sage grouse  that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act  which could lead to material restrictions as to federal land use 
these laws  regulations and court decisions  together with any other changes in law related to the use of eminent domain or the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered  could inhibit our ability to secure rights of way or access land for current or future pipeline construction projects 
as a result  obtaining rights of way may require additional regulatory and environmental compliance and additional expenditures  which could delay our co pipeline construction schedule and initiation of operations of our pipelines  and or increase the costs of constructing our pipelines 
our level of indebtedness may adversely affect operations and limit our growth 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants related to such indebtedness  including covenants in our bank credit facility  we would be in default under our debt instruments 
this default could permit the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under other indebtedness  possibly resulting in our bankruptcy 
our ability to meet our obligations will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions  commodity prices  and financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
as of february   we had outstanding billion principal amount of subordinated notes at interest rates ranging from to at a weighted average interest rate of and no amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility 
we currently have a borrowing base of billion under our bank credit facility  and at february   nearly all of this amount was available on such facility 
the next regularly scheduled semiannual redetermination of the borrowing base for our bank credit facility will be in may our bank borrowing base is adjusted at the banks discretion and is based in part upon external factors  such as commodity prices  over which we have no control 
if our then redetermined borrowing base is less than our outstanding borrowings under the facility  we will be required to repay the deficit over a period not to exceed four months 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under our bank credit facility in connection with our acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration of oil and natural gas producing properties 
further  our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas 
if oil and natural gas prices again decrease and remain at depressed levels for an extended period of time  our degree of leverage could increase substantially 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences  including but not limited to the following a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations may be dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and would not be available for capital expenditures or other purposes  our level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate and other purposes  our interest expense may increase in the event of increases in market interest rates  because bank borrowings are at variable rates of interest  our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions may be greater as a result of our level of indebtedness  and increases in interest rates thereon  potentially restricting us from making acquisitions  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  pay dividends and make certain investments may be limited by the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness  and our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in the economy and in our industry 
our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under such debt instruments which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents denbury resources inc product price derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  we currently  and may in the future  enter into derivative contracts in order to economically hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production 
derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
in addition  these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
information as to these activities is set forth under item market risk management in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements 
a worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity  business and financial condition that we cannot predict 
liquidity is essential to our business 
our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital in the long term or short term debt capital markets or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank financing 
a prolonged credit crisis  including the sovereign debt crisis in europe and related turmoil in the global financial system  could materially affect our liquidity  business and financial condition 
these conditions have adversely impacted financial markets and have created substantial volatility and uncertainty  and may continue to do so  with the related negative impact on global economic activity and the financial markets 
negative credit market conditions could materially affect our liquidity and may inhibit our lenders from fully funding our bank credit facility or cause them to make the terms of our bank credit facility more costly and more restrictive 
we are subject to semiannual reviews  as well as unscheduled reviews  of our borrowing base under our bank credit facility  and we do not know the results of future redeterminations or the effect of then current oil and natural gas prices on that process 
the economic situation could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers and cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection 
additionally  negative economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for oil and natural gas  or lower prices for oil and natural gas  which could have a negative impact on our revenues 
our future performance depends upon our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we can successfully replace the reserves that we produce  our reserves will decline  resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations 
we have historically replaced reserves through both acquisitions and internal organic growth activities 
in the future  we may not be able to continue to replace reserves at acceptable costs 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
we may not be able to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if our cash flows from operations are reduced  due to lower oil or natural gas prices or otherwise  or if external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
further  the process of using co for tertiary recovery and the related infrastructure requires significant capital investment  up to four or five years prior to any resulting production and cash flows from these projects  heightening potential capital constraints 
if we do not continue to make significant capital expenditures  or if outside capital resources become limited  we may not be able to maintain our growth rate or meet expectations 
during the last few years  we have acquired several fields at a significant cost because we believe that they have significant additional potential through tertiary flooding  we paid a premium price for these properties based on that assumption 
in addition  we plan to continue acquiring other oil fields that we believe are tertiary flood candidates 
we are investing significant amounts of capital as part of this strategy 
if we are unable to successfully develop the potential oil in these acquired fields  it would negatively affect the return on our investment on these acquisitions and could severely reduce our ability to obtain additional capital for the future  fund future acquisitions  and negatively affect our financial results to a significant degree 

table of contents denbury resources inc oil and natural gas drilling and producing operations involve various risks 
drilling activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that new wells drilled by us will not discover commercially productive reservoirs or the risk that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 
drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling  operating and other costs 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
further  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the gulf of mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations  and winter conditions and forest fires in the rocky mountain region that can delay or impede operations  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  and cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  equipment  pipelines and services 
our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells  including encountering well blowouts  cratering and explosions  pipe failure  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids  release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks 
the nature of these risks is such that some liabilities could exceed our insurance policy limits  or  as in the case of environmental fines and penalties  cannot be insured 
we could incur significant costs related to these risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our co tertiary recovery projects require a significant amount of electricity to operate the facilities 
if these costs were to increase significantly  it could have an adverse effect upon the profitability of these operations 
additionally  a portion of our production activities involve co injections into fields with wells plugged and abandoned by prior operators 
it is often difficult to determine whether a well has been properly plugged prior to commencing injections and pressuring the oil reservoirs 
if wells have not been properly plugged  we will have to modify the wells  which can increase costs  delay our operations and reduce our production 
certain of our operations may be limited during certain periods due to severe weather conditions and other regulations 
certain of our operations in north dakota  montana and wyoming are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions and often in difficult terrain 
as a result  our operations may be delayed because of cold  snow and wet conditions  and certain operations may be practical only during non winter months 
unusually severe weather could delay certain of these operations  including the construction of co pipelines  the drilling of new wells and production from existing wells  and depending on the severity of the weather  could have a negative effect on our results of operations in this region 
further  certain of our operations are limited to certain time periods due to environmental regulations  which can slow down our operations  cause delays and have a negative effect on our results of operations 
shortages of oil field equipment  services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations 
the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations  geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices  causing periodic shortages in such personnel 
in recent years  the competition for qualified technical personnel has been extensive and our personnel costs have been escalating at a rate higher than general inflation 
during periods of high oil and natural gas prices  we have experienced shortages of equipment used in our tertiary facilities  drilling rigs and other equipment  as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with higher commodity prices 
higher oil and natural gas prices 
table of contents denbury resources inc generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs  crews and associated supplies  oilfield equipment and services  and personnel in our exploration and production operations 
these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin  cash flow and operating results and or restrict or delay our ability to drill those wells and conduct those operations that we currently have planned and budgeted  causing us to miss our forecasts and projections 
governmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection are costly and stringent 
our exploration  production  and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations affect the costs  manner  and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in our efforts to comply 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several  strict liability for contamination resulting from spills  discharges  and releases of substances  including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
under such laws and regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination  including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators 
changes in or additions to environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes or additions that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal  or cleanup or other environmental protection requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 
enactment of legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business 
numerous legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced  are anticipated to be introduced or are otherwise under consideration by congress and various federal agencies 
among these proposals are climate change carbon tax legislation introduced in congress and epa regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  including an epa proposal to apply new source performance standards for petroleum refineries expected in  proposals contained in the president budget  along with legislation introduced in congress  none of which have passed congress  to impose new taxes on  or repeal various tax deductions available to  oil and gas producers  such as the current tax deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and qualified tertiary injectant expenses which  if eliminated  could raise the cost of energy production  reduce energy investment and affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production activities  legislation previously considered by congress but not adopted that would subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the safe drinking water act and new or anticipated department of interior and epa regulations to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process  and the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty  and job creation act enacted in  which increases penalties  grants new authority to impose damage prevention and incident notification requirements  and directs the department of transportation to prescribe minimum safety standards for co pipelines  any of which could affect our operations  and the costs thereof 
generally  any future laws and regulations could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions and could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold 
however  until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and implemented  it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition 
certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated  and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed  as a result of future legislation 
in recent years  legislation has been proposed that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to us federal income tax laws  including the elimination of certain us federal income tax benefits and deductions currently available to oil and gas companies 
such changes include  but are not limited to  the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties  the increase of the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses  the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and qualified tertiary injectant expenses  and the elimination of the deduction for certain us production activities 
it is unclear whether any such proposals will be enacted into law and  if so  what form such laws might possibly take 
the passage of such legislation or any other similar change in us federal income tax law could eliminate  reduce or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents denbury resources inc the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
the dodd frank act requires the commodities futures trading commission  and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market 
these new rules and regulations could significantly increase the cost or decrease the liquidity of energy related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity price fluctuations 
although we believe the derivative contracts that we enter into should not be materially impacted by these new statutory and regulatory requirements  because derivatives regulations have not been finalized  final regulations could negatively affect to our detriment the economics and terms of derivative instruments available from counterparties in the marketplace 
the loss of more than one of our large oil and natural gas purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
for the year ended december   two purchasers individually accounted for or more of our oil and natural gas revenues and  in the aggregate  for of such revenues 
the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production  which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive 
estimating our reserves  production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty 
estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors such as future commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs  and the assumed effect of governmental regulation 
there are numerous uncertainties about when a property may have proved reserves as compared to potential or probable reserves  particularly relating to our tertiary recovery operations 
forecasting the amount of oil reserves recoverable from tertiary operations and the production rates anticipated therefrom requires estimates  one of the most significant being the oil recovery factor 
actual results most likely will vary from our estimates 
also  the use of a discount factor for reporting purposes  as prescribed by the sec  may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor  given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes of conditions could result in a reduction of the quantities and net present value of our reserves 
the reserve data included in documents incorporated by reference represent only estimates 
quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions  including first day of the month average oil and natural gas prices for the month period preceding the date of the assessment 
our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic conditions  including oil and natural gas prices  as well as due to production results  results of future development  operating and development costs  and other factors 
downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and cost used in the estimate 
as of december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and may require successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully  but these assumptions may not be accurate  and these expenditures and operations may not occur 
significant acquisitions or other transactions could require substantial external capital and could change our risk and property profile 
to finance acquisitions  we may need to substantially alter or increase our capitalization through the use of our bank credit facility  the issuance of debt or equity securities  the sale of production payments  or by other means 
such changes in capitalization could significantly affect our risk profile 
additionally  significant acquisitions or other transactions can change the character of our operations and business 
the character of the new properties may be substantially different in operating or geological characteristics or geographic location from that of our existing properties 

table of contents denbury resources inc our results of operations could be negatively affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of a business 
at december   the company goodwill balance totaled billion and represented approximately of our total assets 
goodwill is not amortized  rather it is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the company goodwill may be impaired  requiring an estimate of the fair values of the reporting unit assets and liabilities 
an impairment of goodwill could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and equity 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates impairment assessment of goodwill 
we may lose executive officers or other key management personnel  which could endanger the future success of our operations 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management personnel 
our employees  including our executive officers  are employed at will and do not have employment agreements 
if one or more members of our management team dies  becomes disabled or voluntarily terminates employment with us  there is no assurance that we will find a suitable or comparable substitute 
we believe that our future success depends  in large part  upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial personnel 
competition for persons with these skills is intense  and we cannot assure that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel 
the loss of any of our management personnel could adversely affect our operations 
a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft  data corruption  operational disruption  and or financial loss 
our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day to day operations  including certain of our exploration  development and production activities 
we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves  process and record financial and operating data  analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business 
our technologies  systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations 
for example  unauthorized access to our seismic data  reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption  communication interruption  or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations 
to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks  however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future 
as cyber threats continue to evolve  we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities
