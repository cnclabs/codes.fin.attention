item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our revenues are derived from sales of floorcovering products  primarily modular carpet we sold our broadloom carpet operations in august 
our business  as well as the commercial interiors industry in general  is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic conditions and trends that affect the markets for commercial and institutional business space 
the commercial interiors industry  including the market for floorcovering products  is largely driven by reinvestment by corporations into their existing businesses in the form of new fixtures and furnishings for their workplaces 
in significant part  the timing and amount of such reinvestments are impacted by the profitability of those corporations 
as a result  macroeconomic factors such as employment rates  office vacancy rates  capital spending  productivity and efficiency gains that impact corporate profitability in general  also affect our business 
during the past several years  we have successfully focused more of our marketing and sales efforts on non corporate office segments to reduce somewhat our exposure to economic cycles that affect the corporate office market segment more adversely  as well as to capture additional market share 
our mix of corporate office versus non corporate office modular carpet sales in the americas has shifted over the past several years to and  respectively  for compared with and  respectively  in company wide  our mix of corporate office versus non corporate office sales was and  respectively  in we expect a further shift in the future as we continue to implement our market diversification strategy

fire at australia facility in july  a fire occurred at our manufacturing facility in picton  australia 
the fire caused extensive damage to the facility  as well as disruption to business activity in the region 
we have taken steps towards re adapting our supply chain with product from our facilities in china  thailand  the us and europe 
while this is being executed with success  there were  as expected  delays in shipments that affected sales following the fire 
at this time  it is difficult to quantify the financial impacts of the fire  but we believe it negatively affected net sales by approximately million during the balance of for additional information on the fire  please see the note entitled fire at australian manufacturing facility in item of this report 
discontinued operations in the third quarter of  we sold our bentley prince street business segment 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we have reported the results of operations for the former bentley prince street business segment as discontinued operations  where applicable

the remainder of the charge million relates to contract termination and fixed asset impairment costs 
approximately million of this charge will result in cash expenditures  primarily severance expenses 
actions and expense related to this plan were substantially completed by the end of restructuring plan in  we adopted a restructuring plan primarily related to workforce reduction in our european modular carpet operations 
this reduction was in response to the continued challenging economic climate in that region 
smaller amounts were incurred in connection with restructuring activities in the americas 
a total of approximately employees were affected by this restructuring plan 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
substantially all of this charge involved cash expenditures  primarily severance expenses 
actions and expenses related to this plan were substantially completed in senior notes on december   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on june and december the first payment was on june  
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes plus cash on hand in connection with the repurchase of approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes  pursuant to a tender offer we conducted in we incurred million of bond retirement expenses in in connection with these repurchases pursuant to the tender offer

in april  we redeemed the balance of the senior subordinated notes at a price equal to of the face value of the notes  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
analysis of results of operations the following discussion and analyses reflect the factors and trends discussed in the preceding sections 
our net sales that were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar were approximately in  in  and in because we have such substantial international operations  we are impacted  from time to time  by international developments that affect foreign currency transactions 
for example  the performance of the euro against the us dollar  for purposes of the translation of european revenues into us dollars  favorably affected our reported results during  when the euro was strengthening relative to the us dollar 
during the years and  the dollar strengthened versus the euro  having the opposite effect on our reported results 
the following table presents the amount in us dollars by which the exchange rates for converting euros into us dollars have affected our net sales and operating income during the past three years in millions net sales operating income the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations during the past three years fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit on sales selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges expenses related to australia fire operating income interest other expense bond retirement expenses income from continuing operations before tax income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income net income attributable to interface  inc net sales below we provide information regarding our net sales and analyze those results for each of the last three fiscal years 
fiscal years  and were week periods 
as a result of the sale of our bentley prince street segment in  we currently have only one segment for segment reporting purposes 
fiscal year percentage change in thousands compared compared with with net sales for  net sales decreased million versus on a worldwide basis  the general economic uncertainty has had an impact on buyers of our product  as we experienced declines in almost all market segments with the exception of the residential market 
on a geographic basis  we experienced a sales increase in the americas up  which was offset by decreases in europe down and asia pacific down 
in the americas  the increase in sales was due to the continued rebound of the corporate office market up  as well as increases in the residential up and education up market segments 
the increase in residential was largely as a result of the continuing roll out of our flor stores  which now comprises locations across the united states and one store in canada 
these increases in the americas were somewhat offset by decreases in the government down and healthcare down market segments 
the weighted average selling price per square yard in the americas saw an increase of approximately in in europe  currency translation was the driving factor behind the decrease  as we experienced a decline of as reported in us dollars  but in local currency the sales were essentially even with the prior year 
all market segments in europe experienced a decline as reported in us dollars  with corporate office being the most significant down 
on a local currency basis  however  the corporate office segment saw a increase  which was mitigated by smaller decreases in the retail down and government down market segments 
the weighted average selling price per square yard in europe was down approximately in us dollars  but up approximately in local currency 
due largely to both the fire in our plant in australia in july of  as well as the lack of government stimulus funds in versus  we experienced a sales decline in the asia pacific region of versus while it is difficult to quantify  we believe that the fire at our australia facility and the related delays in shipments while we worked to stabilize our supply chain led to a reduction of million in net sales for the most significant decline was in the education market down due to the curtailment of government stimulus in the region  particularly in australia 
the decline in asia pacific was also fueled by lower sales in the hospitality down and corporate office down market segments 
the weighted average selling price in the asia pacific region was essentially even compared with we have begun building a new facility in australia which we hope to have completed by the fourth quarter of we believe this new facility  coupled with the stabilization of our supply chain from other facilities  will help improve performance in asia pacific in for  net sales increased million versus the weighted average selling price per square yard increased approximately in versus on a geographic basis  we experienced increases in net sales in all regions for versus  with our americas  europe and asia pacific regions experiencing sales growth of  and  respectively europe experienced sales growth in local currency 
the recovery of the corporate office market was the largest factor in this increase in sales  although smaller increases occurred in certain non office commercial market segments 
in the americas  the corporate office market segment saw an increase of during success in certain non office commercial markets also fueled the sales increase  particularly in the education up  healthcare up and retail up market segments 
sales in the residential market segment  helped by the opening of new flor stores during the year  showed an improvement of during these increases were offset somewhat by sales decreases in the government down and hospitality down market segments 
sales growth in europe was also due to the strength of the corporate office market segment up in us dollars  in local currency  as well as success in the government up in us dollars  in local currency and education up in us dollars  in local currency market segments 
these gains were somewhat offset by a decline in the residential market segment down in us dollars  in local currency in europe 
as in our other geographic areas  the increased sales in asia pacific were due to the strength of the corporate office market segment up 
asia pacific also saw increases in the healthcare up and hospitality up market segments 
these increases were partially offset by sales decreases in the education down and government down market segments 
cost and expenses the following table presents our overall cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses during the past three years fiscal year percentage change compared with compared with cost and expenses in thousands cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses total for  our cost of sales decreased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates resulted in approximately million of decrease in cost of sales  so absent currency translation effects  there was an increase in the cost of sales in versus the increase absent currency translation effects is primarily attributable to a increase in raw material prices in versus  lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs associated with lower production volumes in versus  and supply chain disruption in the second half of as a result of the fire at our facility in picton  australia 
due to these factors  we saw in increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales to in versus in we did see improvement in gross margin in the fourth quarter of versus the comparable period in due to higher absorption of fixed costs due to higher production volumes  as well as the beginning of realization of savings from our restructuring plans 
however  this quarterly improvement was not substantial enough to counteract the above factors in the earlier parts of the year 
for  our cost of sales increased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million approximately of the increase 
the primary components of this increase in cost of sales were the increases in raw materials costs approximately million and labor costs approximately million associated with higher production volumes  particularly in the first six months of  compared with in addition  our raw materials costs during were approximately higher than raw materials costs in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to for  versus in this percentage increase is primarily due to the significant increase in raw materials costs we experienced during reduced absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production volumes during the fourth quarter of also negatively impacted gross profit margins as well 
for  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
the largest component of the change in selling  general and administrative expense was a decrease in administrative costs of approximately million  which is due primarily to lower stock compensation expense of million during the first six months of  particularly in the americas  as a result of performance goals not being obtained to the same degree as in there also was a decrease in administrative expenses due to the significant restructuring actions which took place in and  particularly in our european operations 
we also experienced a decrease of million in marketing expense  particularly in the americas  due to lower catalog circulation in our flor business approximately million  as well as reduced marketing programs as we evaluate the cost effectiveness of our marketing platform in light of market requirements 
these decreases were offset somewhat by increased selling costs of million  primarily in the americas  due to both the flor store rollout approximately million as well as sales personnel additions in the americas in response to positive market conditions in that region  and increased selling costs due to increased sales in the americas approximately million increase 
due to the above factors  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative costs declined to in versus in for  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the primary components of this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were a million increase in selling expense  commensurate with the increase in sales as well as selected investments made in our consumer market and diversification strategies  an million increase in overall administrative costs due  in part  to increases in non cash incentive based pay during  particularly in the first six months of the year 
due to these increases  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for  versus for interest expense for interest expense decreased million versus this decrease was primarily due to the redemption of the remaining million our senior subordinated notes due in april of for interest expense decreased million versus this decrease was due to the issuance of our senior notes in the fourth quarter of  the proceeds of which we used to complete the repurchase of substantially all of our senior secured notes and our outstanding senior subordinated notes pursuant to the tender offer discussed above 
our use of the proceeds from our senior notes to retire higher interest debt led to a significant reduction in our interest expense  as compared to tax our effective tax rate in was  compared with an effective rate of in this increase in effective rate was primarily attributable to nondeductible business expenses associated with the fire at the australia plant  and a nondeductible reserve on capital assets associated with our restructuring plan 
in addition  there were decreases in the effective rate attributable to the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and tax effects of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested  which were offset by increases in the effective rate for foreign and u 
s tax effects attributable to foreign operations 
for additional information on taxes and a reconciliation of effective tax rates to statutory tax rates  see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report 
our effective tax rate in was  compared with an effective rate of in this increase in effective rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies associated with the funding of our nonqualified savings plan and salary continuation plan resulting in nondeductible losses in as compared with an increase in  which resulted in nontaxable gains  a decrease in state tax benefits due to less state net operating losses in as compared with  and less of a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in as compared with the increase in effective rate was partially offset by a decrease in valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards and a decrease in the us tax effects attributable to foreign operations related to subpart f income 
for additional information on taxes and a reconciliation of effective tax rates to statutory tax rates  see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources general in our business  we require cash and other liquid assets primarily to purchase raw materials and to pay other manufacturing costs  in addition to funding normal course selling  general and administrative expenses  anticipated capital expenditures  interest expense and potential special projects 
we generate our cash and other liquidity requirements primarily from our operations and from borrowings or letters of credit under our domestic revolving credit facility with a banking syndicate 
we believe that we will be able to continue to enhance the generation of free cash flow through the following initiatives improving our inventory turns by continuing to implement a made to order model throughout our organization  reducing our average days sales outstanding through improved credit and collection practices  and limiting the amount of our capital expenditures generally to those projects that have a short term payback period 
historically  we use more cash in the first half of the fiscal year  as we fund insurance premiums  tax payments  incentive compensation and inventory build up in preparation for the holiday vacation season of our international operations 
in addition  we have a high contribution margin business with low capital expenditure requirements 
contribution margin represents variable gross profit margin less the variable component of selling  general and administrative expenses  and for us is an indicator of profit on incremental sales after the fixed components of cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses have been recovered 
while contribution margin should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin  which is determined in accordance with gaap  it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to our potential for profitability 
in addition  we believe that investors find contribution margin to be a useful tool for measuring our profitability on an operating basis 
at december   we had million in cash 
approximately million of this cash was located in the unites states  and the remaining million was located at our international locations 
our position is that the cash located outside of the united states is permanently reinvested in the respective jurisdictions except as identified below 
we believe that our strategic plans and business needs support the status of our cash in foreign locations particularly as we build our new facility in minto  australia and review other international investment opportunities 
of the million in cash in foreign jurisdictions  approximately million represents earnings which we have determined are not permanently reinvested  and as such we have provided for us federal and state income taxes on these amounts in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
as of december   we had no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under our domestic revolving credit facility  and no borrowings outstanding under our european credit facility 
as of december   we could have incurred million of additional borrowings under our domestic revolving credit facility and million approximately million of additional borrowings under our european credit facility 
in addition  we could have incurred the equivalent of million of borrowings under our other credit facilities in place at other non us subsidiaries 
we have approximately million in contractual cash obligations due by the end of fiscal year  which includes  among other things  pension cash contributions  interest payments on our debt and capital expenditure commitments 
based on current interest rate and debt levels  we expect our aggregate interest expense for to be between million and million 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures in to be between million and million  although we are not committed to these amounts 
on december   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on june and december the first payment was made on june  
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes plus cash on hand in connection with the repurchase of approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes and approximately million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes  pursuant to a tender offer we conducted 
we also have million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior secured notes 
it is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our outstanding million of senior secured notes mature in november  our domestic revolving credit facility matures in june  and our outstanding million of senior notes mature in we cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing  we would have to consider other options  such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs  or using cash  if available  that would have been used for other business purposes

analysis of cash flows our primary sources of cash during were million of net proceeds from the sale of our bentley prince street business segment  million as a result of reduction of accounts receivable  and million of proceeds from the insurance company with regard to the fire at our australian facility 
our primary uses of cash during were million of capital expenditures  an increase of prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  primarily related to the insurance receivable for our fire claim in australia  and million for the redemption of the remainder of our senior subordinated notes 
our primary sources of cash during were million of cash received as a result of exercises of employee stock options  and million received due to a reduction of prepaid expenses 
our primary uses of cash during were million for capital expenditures  million due to increased inventory levels  and million due to decreases in accounts payable and accruals 
our primary sources of cash during were million of gross proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes  million due to an increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses  and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
our primary uses of cash during were million used to repurchase a portion of our senior secured notes and former senior subordinated notes  million for premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of these senior and senior subordinated notes  million for capital expenditures  and million due to an increase in inventory 
we believe that our liquidity position will provide sufficient funds to meet our current commitments and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
funding obligations we have various contractual obligations that we must fund as part of our normal operations 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations including the remaining contractual obligations related to our discontinued operations and the periods in which payments are due 
the amounts and time periods are measured from december  payments due by period total payments due less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations expected interest payments unconditional purchase obligations pension cash obligations total contractual cash obligations our capital lease obligations are insignificant 
expected interest payments to be made in future periods reflect anticipated interest payments related to the million of our senior notes  and the million of outstanding senior secured notes 
we have also assumed in the presentation above that these notes will remain outstanding until maturity 
we have excluded from the presentation interest payments and fees related to our revolving credit facilities discussed above  because of the variability and timing of advances and repayments thereunder 
unconditional purchase obligations do not include unconditional purchase obligations that are included as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our capital expenditure commitments are not significant 
we have two foreign defined benefit plans and a domestic salary continuation plan 
we have presented above the estimated cash obligations that will be paid under these plans over the next ten years 
such amounts are based on several estimates and assumptions and could differ materially should the underlying estimates and assumptions change 
our domestic salary continuation plan is an unfunded plan  and we do not currently have any commitments to make contributions to this plan 
however  we do use insurance instruments to hedge our exposure under the salary continuation plan 
contributions to our other employee benefit plans are at our discretion 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which payments are uncertain 
see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report for further information 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimations about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events may not develop as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally on the date of shipment 
provisions for discounts  sales returns and allowances are estimated using historical experience  current economic trends  and the company s quality performance 
the related provision is recorded as a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of net sales for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred are classified in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment is indicated 
a loss is then recognized for the difference  if any  between the fair value of the asset as estimated by management using its best judgment and the carrying value of the asset 
if actual market value is less favorable than that estimated by management  additional write downs may be required 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards  and are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income  as well as management s judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards 
the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management s interpretations of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations 
we evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and our short and long term business forecasts to provide insight 
further  our global business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
as of december   and january   we had approximately million and million of us federal net operating loss carryforwards  respectively 
in addition  as of december   and january   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
as of december   and january   we had approximately million and million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  respectively 
certain of these carryforwards are reserved with a valuation allowance because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future 
the remaining year end amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
if the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted goodwill 
pursuant to applicable accounting standards  we test goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step approach 
in the first step of this approach  we prepare valuations of reporting units  using both a market comparable approach and an income approach  and those valuations are compared with the respective book values of the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment exists 
in preparing the valuations  past  present and expected future performance is considered 
if impairment is indicated in this first step of the test  a step two valuation approach is performed 
the step two valuation approach compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the book value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets  in the same manner as goodwill is determined in a business combination under applicable accounting standards 
after completion of this step two test  a loss is recognized for the difference  if any  between the fair value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit and the book value of that goodwill 
if the actual fair value of the goodwill is determined to be less than that estimated  an additional write down may be required 
during the fourth quarters of  and  we performed the annual goodwill impairment test 
we perform this test at the reporting unit level 
for our reporting units which carried a goodwill balance as of december   no impairment of goodwill was indicated 
as of december   if our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units were lower  we believe no additional goodwill impairment would have existed 
inventories 
we determine the value of inventories using the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventories for the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and their net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
we estimate our reserves for inventory obsolescence by continuously examining our inventories to determine if there are indicators that carrying values exceed net realizable values 
experience has shown that significant indicators that could require the need for additional inventory write downs are the age of the inventory  the length of its product life cycles  anticipated demand for our products and current economic conditions 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
our inventory reserve on december   and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent that actual obsolescence of our inventory differs from our estimate by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis 
pension benefits 
net pension expense recorded is based on  among other things  assumptions about the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets and salary increases 
while management believes these assumptions are reasonable  changes in these and other factors and differences between actual and assumed changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of our plans above certain thresholds could cause net annual expense to increase or decrease materially from year to year 
the actuarial assumptions used in our salary continuation plan and our foreign defined benefit plans reporting are reviewed periodically and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class 
expected returns reflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets  and include input from actuaries  investment service firms and investment managers 
the table below represents the changes to the projected benefit obligation as a result of changes in discount rates assumptions increase decrease in projected benefit obligation foreign defined benefit plans in millions increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate increase decrease in projected benefit obligation domestic salary continuation plan in millions increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate environmental remediation 
we provide for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
we regularly monitor the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made 
as of december   and january   no significant amounts were provided for remediation liabilities 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strengths of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective  and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
our allowance for doubtful accounts on december   and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent the actual collectability of our accounts receivable differs from our estimates by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis  depending on whether the actual collectability was better or worse  respectively  than the estimated allowance 
product warranties 
we typically provide limited warranties with respect to certain attributes of our carpet products for example  warranties regarding excessive surface wear  edge ravel and static electricity for periods ranging from ten to twenty years  depending on the particular carpet product and the environment in which the product is to be installed 
we typically warrant that any services performed will be free from defects in workmanship for a period of one year following completion 
in the event of a breach of warranty  the remedy typically is limited to repair of the problem or replacement of the affected product 
we record a provision related to warranty costs based on historical experience and periodically adjust these provisions to reflect changes in actual experience 
our warranty reserve on december   and january   was million and million  respectively 
actual warranty expense incurred could vary significantly from amounts that we estimate 
to the extent the actual warranty expense differs from our estimates by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis  depending on whether the actual expense is lower or higher  respectively  than the estimated provision 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard regarding the performance of a company s annual goodwill impairment evaluation 
this standard allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended an accounting standard regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
this amendment will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the amended guidance  which must be applied retroactively  was to be effective for interim and annual periods ending after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
in december of  the fasb issued an amendment to this statement which defers the requirements of this standard 
as this amendment only effects presentation  there is not expected to be any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk as a result of the scope of our global operations  we are exposed to an element of market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted by this risk 
we manage our exposure to market risk through our regular operating and financial activities and  to the extent we deem appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we employ derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
we monitor the use of derivative financial instruments through objective measurable systems  well defined market and credit risk limits  and timely reports to senior management according to prescribed guidelines 
we have established strict counter party credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions with a rating of investment grade or better 
as a result  we consider the risk of counter party default to be minimal 
interest rate market risk exposure changes in interest rates affect the interest paid on certain of our debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  our management has developed and implemented a policy to maintain the percentage of fixed and variable rate debt within certain parameters 
in the past  we have maintained a fixed variable rate mix within these parameters either by borrowing on a fixed rate basis or entering into interest rate swap transactions 
in the interest rate swaps  we agree to exchange  at specified levels  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal linked to libor 
as of december   and january   no such interest rate swaps were in place 
foreign currency exchange market risk exposure a significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  northern ireland  the netherlands  china and thailand  and sell our products in more than countries 
in  we ceased manufacturing operations at our facility in england 
in addition  manufacturing in australia has been suspended temporarily as we rebuild following a fire 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and many other currencies  including the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  thai baht and japanese yen 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of anticipated sales in those currencies decreases  and vice versa 
additionally  to the extent our foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar transact business in countries other than the united states  exchange rate changes between two foreign currencies could ultimately impact us 
finally  because we report in us dollars on a consolidated basis  foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have a translation impact on our financial position 
at december   we recognized an million increase in our foreign currency translation adjustment account compared with january   because of the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies during sensitivity analysis for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact that market risk may have on the fair values of our market sensitive instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values associated with the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
the market value of instruments affected by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk is computed based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
the discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at december  the values that result from these computations are then compared with the market values of the financial instruments 
the differences are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
interest rate risk based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates  with all other variables held constant  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would be impacted by a net decrease of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as of december   a decrease or increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in a decrease in the fair value of our short term financial instruments primarily cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable of million or an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of million  respectively 
as the impact of offsetting changes in the fair market value of our net foreign investments is not included in the sensitivity model  these results are not indicative of our actual exposure to foreign currency exchange risk
