item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our international markets are not successful  our business could suffer 
we currently sell our products in the international markets of canada  mexico  austria  the czech republic  denmark  estonia  finland  germany  the republic of ireland  namibia  netherlands  norway  south africa  sweden  the united kingdom  australia  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  singapore and taiwan and ship our products to the ukraine and hong kong through existing distribution channels 
our international operations could experience changes in legal and regulatory requirements  as well as difficulties in adapting to new foreign cultures and business customs 
if we do not adequately address such issues  our international markets may not meet growth expectations 
our international operations and future expansion plans are subject to political  economic  and social uncertainties  including inflation  the renegotiation or modification of various agreements  increases in custom duties and tariffs  changes and limits in export controls  government regulations and laws  trademark availability and registration issues  changes in exchange rates  changes in taxation  wars and other hostilities  and changes in the perception of network marketing 
any negative changes related to these factors could adversely affect our business  profitability  and growth prospects 
furthermore  any negative changes in our distribution channels may force us to invest significant time and money related to our distribution and sales to maintain our position in certain international markets 
adverse or negative publicity could cause our business to suffer 
our business depends  in part  on the public s perception of our integrity and the safety and quality of our products 
any adverse publicity could negatively affect the public s perception about our industry  our products  or our reputation and could result in a significant decline in our operations and or the number of our independent associates 
specifically  we are susceptible to adverse or negative publicity regarding the nutritional supplements industry  skeptical consumers  
table of contents competitors  the safety and quality of our products and or our ingredients  regulatory investigations of our products or our competitors products  the actions of our independent associates  the direct selling network marketing industry  and scandals within the industries in which we operate 
for instance  on july   the texas attorney general filed suit against us  mannarelief ministries  samuel l 
caster  the fisher institute  and h 
reginald mcdaniel alleging violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act and the texas food  drug and cosmetic act 
we subsequently reached an agreement with the texas attorney general s office settling an enforcement action against us  our former chief executive officer and chairman of the board  samuel l 
caster  and others 
without admitting any wrongdoing  we agreed to refund up to million to certain members and pay million to cover fees and expenses of texas regulators 
the settlement did not include any fine or penalty against the company 
we have also taken a number of actions to address concerns raised by the texas attorney general s action 
although the matter has been resolved  the lawsuit created a substantial amount of adverse publicity that may have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business 
if our information technology system fails  our operations could suffer 
like many companies  our business is heavily dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage and operate many of our key business functions  including order processing  supply chain management  customer service  product distribution  commission processing  cash receipts and payments  and financial reporting 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage and interruption from fires  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  and other events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
although we maintain an extensive security system and disaster recovery program that was developed under the guidelines published by the national institute of standards of technology  a long term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day to day business 
taxation and transfer pricing affect our operations and we could be subjected to additional taxes  duties  interest  and penalties in material amounts  which could harm our business 
as a multinational corporation  in many countries  including the united states  we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that our intercompany transactions are consummated at prices that have not been manipulated to produce a desired tax result  that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by the local entities  and that we are taxed appropriately on such transactions 
regulators closely monitor our corporate structure  intercompany transactions  and how we effectuate intercompany fund transfers 
if regulators challenge our corporate structure  transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers  our operations may be harmed and our effective tax rate may increase 
a change in applicable tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results 
in the event any audit or assessments are concluded adversely to us  these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits 
in and  we recognized and  respectively  of net sales in markets outside of the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the united states dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted average exchange rate 
if the united states dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies  there is a risk our reported sales  operating expenses  and net income could significantly fluctuate 
we are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations  nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities 

table of contents our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate significantly 
the price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases 
decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock 
the price of our common stock and the price at which we could sell securities in the future could significantly fluctuate in response to broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions  fluctuations in our financial results  future securities offerings  changes in the market s perception of our products or our business  including false or negative publicity  governmental regulatory actions  the outcome of any lawsuits  financial and business announcements made by us or our competitors  the general condition of the industry  and the sale of large amounts of stock by insiders 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies 
the changes sometimes appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock in the open market could fluctuate based on factors that have little or nothing to do with us or that are outside of our control 
certain shareholders  directors  and officers own a significant amount of our stock  which could allow them to influence corporate transactions and other matters 
as of december   our directors  executive officers  and a major shareholder  collectively with their families and affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our total outstanding common stock 
as a result  if two or more of these shareholders choose to act together based on their current share ownership  they may be able to control a significant percentage of the total outstanding shares of our common stock  which could affect the outcome of a shareholder vote on the election of directors  the adoption of stock option plans  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  or the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that may help discourage a change of control 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws  and the texas business organizations code help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our company  even if the proposal may benefit our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval 
our board of directors has the power to determine the price and terms of any preferred stock 
the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholders approval could deter or delay unsolicited changes of control by discouraging open market purchases of our common stock or a non negotiated tender or exchange offer for our common stock 
discouraging open market purchases may be disadvantageous to our shareholders who may otherwise desire to participate in a transaction in which they would receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  other provisions may also discourage a change of control by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
our charter documents provide for three classes of directors on our board of directors with members of each class serving staggered three year terms 
in addition  the texas business organization code restricts  subject to exceptions  business combinations with any affiliated shareholder 
any or all of these provisions could delay  deter or help prevent a takeover of our company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

table of contents our failure to comply with the nasdaq global select market continued listing standards may adversely affect the price and liquidity of our shares of common stock as well as our ability to raise capital in the future 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global select market 
continued listing of a security on nasdaq is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the requirements for maintaining listing on nasdaq 
if we are unsuccessful in maintaining compliance with the continued listing requirements of nasdaq  then our common stock could be delisted 
if our common stock is delisted and we cannot obtain listing on another major market or exchange  our common stock s liquidity would suffer  and we would likely experience reduced investor interest 
such factors may result in a decrease in our common stock s trading price 
delisting may also restrict us from issuing additional securities or securing financing 
to continue to have our common stock eligible for continued listing on nasdaq  we would need to satisfy criteria under at least one of the three standards set forth by the nasdaq stock market 
under equity standard listing rules a and b  these criteria require that we have shareholders equity of at least million  our common stock has at least minimum bid for consecutive business days  our public float must consist of at least  shares with a market value of at least million public float is defined under nasdaq s rules as the shares held by persons other than officers  directors and beneficial owners of greater than of our total outstanding shares  there be at least shareholders  there be at least two market makers for our common stock  and we comply with certain corporate governance requirements 
as of the date of issuance of this report  we were in compliance with these continued listing requirements 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to meet all requisite continued listing criteria 
we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors may decide not to declare dividends in the future 
the declaration of dividends on our common stock is solely within the discretion of our board of directors  subject to limitations under texas law stipulating that dividends may not be paid if payment therefore would cause the corporation to be insolvent or if the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation 
our board of directors may decide not to declare dividends or we could be prevented from declaring a dividend because of legal or contractual restrictions 
the failure to pay dividends could reduce our stock price 
our board of directors suspended dividends in august we may not resume payment of dividends in the future 
we rely upon our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations to fund our business 
in the event that we do not generate adequate cash flow from operations  we will need to raise money through a debt or equity financing  if available  or curtail operations 
the adequacy of our cash resources to continue to meet our future operational needs depends  in large part  on our ability to increase product sales and or reduce operating costs 
if we are unsuccessful in generating positive cash flow from operations  we could exhaust our available cash resources and be required to secure additional funding through a debt or equity financing  significantly scale back our operations  and or discontinue many of our activities which could negatively affect our business and prospects 
additional funding may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our equity line with dutchess may not be available to us if we elect to make a draw down 
on september   we entered into an investment agreement the investment agreement with dutchess opportunity fund ii  lp  a delaware limited partnership dutchess 
pursuant to the investment agreement  dutchess committed to purchase  subject to certain restrictions and conditions  up to  of our common stock  over a period of months from the first trading day following the effectiveness of the registration statement registering the resale of shares purchased by dutchess pursuant to the investment agreement the equity line 
dutchess will not be obligated to purchase shares under the equity line unless certain conditions are met  which include effectiveness of the registration statement  the continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq global select market  our compliance with our obligations under the investment agreement and registration rights agreement entered into with dutchess  the absence of injunctions or other governmental actions prohibiting the issuance of common stock to dutchess  the absence of violations of shareholder approval requirements with respect to such issuance of our common stock to dutchess  the accuracy of representations and warranties made to dutchess  and approval of the equity line transaction by our board of directors 
if we are unable to access funds through the equity line  we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents any draw downs under our equity line with dutchess may result in dilution to our shareholders 
if we sell shares to dutchess under the equity line  it will have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our current shareholders  and may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
if we draw down amounts under the equity line  we will issue shares to dutchess at a discount of up to from the average price of our common stock 
if we draw down amounts under the equity line when our share price is decreasing  we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was higher 
issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if our share price were stable or increasing and may further decrease our share price 
the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us as a smaller reporting company may make our common stock less attractive to investors 
we are a smaller reporting company as defined in rule b of the exchange act 
as a smaller reporting company we prepare and file sec forms similar to other sec reporting companies  however  the information disclosed may differ and be less comprehensive 
if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of less comprehensive information we may disclose pursuant to the exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company  there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile than that of an otherwise comparable company that does not avail itself of the same or similar exemptions 
circumstances and conditions may change 
accordingly  additional risks and uncertainties not currently known  or that we currently deem not material  may also adversely affect our business operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial position and our results of operations for each of the two years ended december  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with item consolidated financial statements and related notes  beginning on page f of this report and with other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
unless stated otherwise  all financial information presented below  throughout this report  and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes includes mannatech and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
company overview since november  we have continued to develop innovative  high quality  proprietary nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products that are sold through a global network marketing system 
we operate in three regions i north america the united states  canada and mexico  ii emea austria  the czech republic  denmark  estonia  finland  germany  the republic of ireland  namibia  the netherlands  norway  south africa  sweden  and the united kingdom  iii asia pacific australia  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  singapore and taiwan 
in november  the company commenced the shipment of its products to the ukraine and in december  the company commenced the shipment of its products to hong kong 
our switzerland office was created to manage certain day to day business needs of non north american markets 
we conduct our business as a single operating segment and primarily sell our products through a network of approximately  active independent associates and members who had purchased our products and or packs during the last months  who we refer to as current independent associates and members 
new recruits and pack sales are leading indicators for the long term success of our business 
new recruits include new independent associates and members purchasing our packs and products for the first time 
we operate as a seller of nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products through our network marketing distribution channels operating in twenty one countries 
we review and analyze net sales by geographical location and by packs and products on a consolidated basis 
each of our subsidiaries sells similar products and exhibits similar economic characteristics  such as selling prices and gross margins 
because we sell our products through network marketing distribution channels  the opportunities and challenges that affect us most are recruitment of new and retention of independent associates and members  entry into new markets and growth of existing markets  niche market development  new product introduction  and investment in our infrastructure 
current economic conditions and recent developments we identified restoring sales volume  profitability and generating positive cash flow as goals for in an effort to achieve these goals  the company i launched a new product during the second quarter of  ii introduced a new sales system to our independent associates intended to allow world wide recruitment of both consumers and business builders  and iii aggressively reduced operational expenses to maximize the effects of incremental revenue growth on profitability and cash flow 
we introduced nutriverus powder for sale on a global basis starting with the united states in the second quarter of and expanding globally during the third and fourth quarters 
also during the second quarter  we introduced our free discount program in the united states and canada 
we believe the introduction of nutriverus powder and the discount program were instrumental to the increase in the number of new independent associates and members during as compared to although we had an increase in the number of new independent associates and members  we continued to experience a decline in overall sales during due to the reduction in the number of existing independent associates  which resulted in a decline in the number of orders processed during during  sales declined primarily due to the reduction in the number of new independent associates and the loss of existing independent associates  which resulted in a decline in the number of orders processed during during  we outsourced our company operated warehouses in the netherlands and the united states to third party logistics companies 
we believe this will decrease shipping time to our independent associates and members  decrease operational expenses and allow us to concentrate on our core competencies 

table of contents we continued our aggressive reduction of operational expenses that started in the second quarter of as compared to expense levels  we were able to reduce our selling administrative expenses by over million and reduce our other operating expenses by over million 
our operating results have continued to improve on a quarterly basis during  and we expect this trend to continue into in  we believe our continued aggressive pursuit of profitability will be realized on a full year basis  as we realized in the third and fourth quarters of in order to achieve full year profitability  we are planning to launch formal operations in two new countries  hong kong and the ukraine  revise our global compensation strategy for our independent associates  and continue to increase our operational efficiencies 
we believe these strategies will allow the company to operate profitably and provide an opportunity to reverse a declining sales trend in order to achive incremental growth in cash flow

we also sell our products to independent members at discounted published retail prices 
product sales for the year ended december  decreased by million  or to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease in product sales was primarily due to the reduction in the number of existing associates  which resulted in a decline in the number of orders processed during the average order value for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the same period in the increase in average order value resulted in approximately million in additional revenue  which partially offset the overall decline in product sales

table of contents provision for income taxes provision for income taxes include current and deferred income taxes for both our domestic and foreign operations 
our statutory income tax rates by jurisdiction are as follows  for the years ended december country australia canada denmark japan mexico norway republic of korea singapore south africa sweden switzerland taiwan united kingdom united states income from our international operations is subject to taxation in the countries in which we operate 
although we may receive foreign income tax credits that would reduce the total amount of income taxes owed in the united states  we may not be able to utilize our foreign income tax credits in the united states 
we use the recognition and measurement provisions of fasb asc topic  income taxes topic to account for income taxes 
the provisions of topic require a company to record a valuation allowance when the more likely than not criterion for realizing a deferred tax asset cannot be met 
a company is to use judgment in reviewing both positive and negative evidence of realizing a deferred tax asset 
furthermore  the weight given to the potential effect of such evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence can be objectively verified 
as a result  we reviewed the operating results  as well as all of the positive and negative evidence related to realization of such deferred tax assets to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in each tax jurisdiction 
as of december  and  we maintained our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the following table in millions  as we believe the more likely than not criterion for recognition and realization purposes  as defined in topic  cannot be met 
country mexico norway sweden switzerland taiwan united states total the dollar amount of the provisions for income taxes is directly related to our results of operations and changes in taxable income among countries 
for the years ended december  and  our effective tax rate was and  respectively 
for and  we had a provision for income tax despite the pre tax losses primarily because of increases in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  increases in uncertain income tax positions  and differences from foreign operations 

table of contents seasonality we believe the impact of seasonality on our consolidated results of operations is minimal 
we have experienced and believe we will continue to experience variations on our quarterly results of operations in response to  among other things the timing of the introduction of new products and incentives  our ability to attract and retain associates and members  the timing of our incentives and contests  the general overall economic outlook  government regulations  the outcome of certain lawsuits  the perception and acceptance of network marketing  and the consumer perception of our products and overall operations 
as a result of these and other factors  our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future 
period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance since we can give no assurances that revenue trends in new markets  as well as in existing markets  will follow our historical patterns 
the market price of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the above factors 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents as of december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  or million  to million from million as of december  the majority of the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to million associated with the settlement of litigation in the first quarter of our principal operating use of cash is to pay for operating expenses  including commissions and incentives  capital assets  inventory purchases  and international expansion  and to pay quarterly cash dividends 
in august  the quarterly cash dividend was suspended and remained suspended as of december  we fund our business objectives  operations  and expansion of our operations through net cash flows from operations rather than incurring long term debt 
working capital working capital represents total current assets less total current liabilities 
at december   our working capital decreased by million  or  to million from million at december  the decrease in working capital primarily related to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash flows our net consolidated cash flows consisted of the following  for the years ended december in millions used in operating activities investing activities financing activities our operating  investing  and financing activities are described in more detail below 
operating activities for the years ended december  and  our net operating activities used cash of million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  net earnings adjusted for noncash activities generated cash of million  and used cash million  respectively  and our working capital accounts used cash of million  and provided cash of million  respectively 
we will continue to aggressively identify opportunities and reduce operational expenses 
we expect that our net operating cash flows in will be sufficient to fund our current operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 
certain events  such as the uncertainty of the worldwide economic environment  could impact our available cash or our ability to generate cash flows from operations 
investing activities for the years ended december  and  our net investing activities used cash of million for each year  respectively 
we had a net use of cash of million and million in and  respectively  for the purchase and sale of capital assets 
we had an increase in restricted cash of million and a decline of restricted cash of million in and  respectively 
financing activities in and  we used cash of million and million respectively  mainly attributable to the repayment of capital lease obligations 
no dividends were declared to shareholders for and 
table of contents general liquidity and cash flows short term liquidity we believe our existing liquidity and anticipated return to positive cash flows from operations are adequate to fund our normal expected future business operations and possible international expansion costs for the next months 
as our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations  this will be dependent on our ability to reverse the declining revenue trend and or continue to reduce operational expenses 
however  if our existing capital resources or cash flows become insufficient to meet current business plans  projections  and existing capital requirements  we may be required to raise additional funds  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we entered into an investment agreement with dutchess opportunity fund  ii  lp  a delaware limited partnership on september  dutchess committed to purchase  subject to certain restrictions and conditions  up to million of our common stock  over a period of months from the first trading following the effectiveness of the registration statement  which was october  we may draw funds from the equity line by selling shares of common stock to dutchess from time to time 
we will not receive any proceeds from the resale of these shares of common stock offered by dutchess 
we will however  receive proceeds from the sale of shares to dutchess pursuant to the equity line 
the proceeds will be used for general working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes 
for more information on the equity line  see note shareholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   no shares of common stock have been issued pursuant to the investment agreement 
we are engaged in ongoing audits in various tax jurisdictions and other disputes in the normal course of business 
it is impossible at this time to predict whether we will incur any liability  or to estimate the ranges of damages  if any  in connection with these matters 
adverse outcomes on these uncertainties may lead to substantial liability or enforcement actions that could adversely affect our cash position 
for more information  see note income taxes and note litigation  to our consolidated financial statements 
long term liquidity we believe our anticipated return to positive cash flows from operations should be adequate to fund our normal expected future business operations and possible international expansion costs for the long term 
as our primary source of liquidity is from our cash flow from operations  this will be dependent on our ability to reverse the declining revenue trend and or continue to reduce operational expenses 
however  if our existing capital resources or cash flows become insufficient to meet anticipated business plans and existing capital requirements  we may be required to raise additional funds  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our future access to the capital markets may be adversely impacted if we fail to maintain compliance with the nasdaq marketplace rules for the continued listing of our stock 
we continuously monitor our compliance with the nasdaq continued listing rules and as of the date of the issuance of this report  we are in compliance with the nasdaq marketplace rules 

table of contents contractual obligations the following summarizes our future commitments and obligations associated with various agreements and contracts as of december   for the years ending december in thousands thereafter total capital lease obligations purchase obligations operating leases post employment royalty employment agreements royalty agreement tax liability other long term obligations total commitments and obligations for purposes of the table  a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is non cancelable  enforceable and legally binding on the company that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
excludes approximately million of finished product purchase orders that may be cancelled or delivery dates changed as of december  represents the tax liability associated with uncertain tax positions  see note to our consolidated financial statements  income taxes 
we have maintained purchase commitments with certain raw material suppliers to purchase minimum quantities and to ensure exclusivity of our raw materials and the proprietary nature of our products 
currently  we have two supply agreements that require minimum purchase commitments 
we also maintain other supply agreements and manufacturing agreements to protect our products  regulate product costs  and help ensure quality control standards 
these agreements do not require us to purchase any set minimums 
we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to acquisitions or purchases of any manufacturing facilities  however  management from time to time explores the possibility of the benefits of purchasing a raw material manufacturing facility to help control costs of our raw materials and help ensure quality control standards 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entity arrangements  nor do we have any off balance sheet arrangements 
market risks please see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk under item a of this form k for additional information about our market risks 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates throughout our financial statements  which are influenced by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates are based on historical trends  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are applicable and reasonable under the circumstances at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our audit committee reviews our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we continually evaluate and review our policies related to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations that require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we also analyze the need for certain estimates  including the need for such items as allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  long lived fixed assets and capitalization of internal use software development costs  reserve for uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances  revenue recognition  sales returns  and deferred revenues  accounting for stock based compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
historically  actual results have not materially deviated from our estimates 
however  we caution readers that actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if circumstances change relating to the various assumptions or conditions used in our estimates  we could experience an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have identified the following applicable critical accounting policies and estimates as of december  
table of contents inventory reserves inventory consists of raw materials  finished goods  and promotional materials that are stated at the lower of cost using standard costs that approximate average costs or market 
we record the amounts charged by the vendors as the costs of inventory 
typically  the net realizable value of our inventory is higher than the aggregate cost 
determination of net realizable value can be complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of net realizable value  the following items are considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer demand  regulatory changes  competitive pricing  and performance of similar products 
if we determine the carrying value of inventory is in excess of estimated net realizable value  we write down the value of inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
we also review inventory for obsolescence in a similar manner and any inventory identified as obsolete is reserved or written off 
our determination of obsolescence is based on assumptions about the demand for our products  product expiration dates  estimated future sales  and general future plans 
we monitor actual sales compared to original projections  and if actual sales are less favorable than those originally projected by us  we record an additional inventory reserve or write down 
historically  our estimates have been close to our actual reported amounts 
however  if our estimates regarding inventory obsolescence are inaccurate or consumer demand for our products changes in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional material losses or gains in excess of our established estimated inventory reserves 
at december  and  our inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
long lived fixed assets and capitalization of software development costs in addition to capitalizing long lived fixed asset costs  we also capitalize costs associated with internally developed software projects collectively fixed assets and amortize such costs over the estimated useful lives of such fixed assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation computed using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
if a fixed asset is sold or otherwise retired or disposed of  the cost of the fixed asset and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is written off and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in other operating costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
we review our fixed assets for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable  such as plans to dispose of an asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
our impairment review includes a comparison of future projected cash flows generated by the asset  or group of assets  with its associated net carrying value 
if the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the fair value is determined by calculating the discounted expected future cash flows using an estimated risk free rate of interest 
any identified impairment losses are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the fixed asset is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value of the fixed asset are not recorded 
in addition  if we determine the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be reduced from our original estimate  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively  based on the new remaining useful life of the fixed asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives  and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge  which could be material to our results of operations 
in addition  if accounting standards change  or if fixed assets become obsolete  we may be required to write off any unamortized costs of fixed assets  or if estimated useful lives change  we would be required to accelerate depreciation or amortization periods and recognize additional depreciation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents historically  our estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets have not materially deviated from actual results 
as of december   the estimated useful lives and net carrying values of fixed assets are as follows estimated useful life net carrying value at december  office furniture and equipment to years million computer hardware and software to years million automobiles to years million leasehold improvements to years million total net carrying value at december  million we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful estimated life of the leased asset or the lease term 
the net carrying costs of fixed assets and construction in progress are exposed to impairment losses if our assumptions and estimates of their carrying values change  there is a change in estimated future cash flow  or there is a change in the estimated useful life of the fixed asset 
based on management s analysis  no impairment existed during the years ended december  and uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances as of december   we recorded million in current liabilities and million in other long term liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions 
the decrease in other long term liabilities as of december  is based on the outcome of the hearing with the appeals division of the irs concerning the thru tax years  allowing for a reduction in our tax positions of approximately million for tax years after as required by topic  we use judgments and make estimates and assumptions related to evaluating the probability of uncertain income tax positions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the potential liability related to an assessment of whether the income tax position will more likely than not be sustained in an income tax audit 
we are also subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years 
therefore  our estimated reserve balances and liability related to uncertain income tax positions may exist for multiple years before the applicable statute of limitations expires or before the taxing authority resolves an issue 
additionally  we may be requested to extend the statute of limitations for tax years under audit 
the majority of current liability related to uncertain income tax positions is associated with an ongoing internal revenue service irs audit 
it is reasonably possible the tax jurisdiction may request that the statute of limitations be extended  which may cause the classification between current and long term to change 
we believe that our tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions are based upon reasonable judgment and estimates  however  if actual results materially differ  our effective income tax rate and cash flows could be affected in the period of discovery or resolution 
we also review the estimates and assumptions used in evaluating the probability of realizing the future benefits of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance when we believe that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
if we are unable to realize the expected future benefits of our deferred tax assets  we are required to provide a valuation allowance 
we use our history and experience  overall profitability  future management plans  and current economic information to evaluate the amount of valuation allowance to record 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from our operations of million because they did not meet the more likely than not criteria as defined by the recognition and measurement provisions of topic in addition  as of december   we had deferred tax assets  after valuation allowance  totaling million  which may not be realized if our assumptions and estimates change  which would affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in the period of discovery or resolution 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue we derive revenue from sales of individual products  sales of starter and renewal packs  and shipping fees 
substantially all product and pack sales are made to independent associates at published wholesale prices and to members at discounted published retail prices 
we record revenue net of any sales taxes and records a reserve for expected sales returns based on its historical experience 

table of contents we recognize revenue from shipped packs and products upon receipt by the customer 
we recognize corporate sponsored event revenue when the event is held 
we defer certain components of our revenue 
at december  and december   deferred revenue was million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of revenue received from i sales of packs and products shipped but not received by the customers by period end  and ii prepaid registration fees from customers planning to attend a future corporate sponsored event 
we estimate a sales return reserve for expected sales refunds based on historical experience over a rolling six month period 
if actual results differ from our estimated sales return reserve due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded each period could be materially affected 
historically  sales returns have not materially changed through the years  as the majority of our customers who return their merchandise do so within the first days after the original sale 
sales returns have averaged or less of our gross sales 
for the year ended december  our sales return reserve was composed of the following in thousands sales reserve as of january  provision related to sales made in provision related to sales made prior to actual returns or credits in related to actual returns or credits in related to prior periods sales reserve as of december  accounting for stock based compensation we grant stock options to our employees  board members  and consultants 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of a stock option award and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period  or the vesting period of such stock option award  which is two to four years 
the fair value of the stock option award is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model the calculated fair value 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock option life  expected volatility  expected average risk free interest rates  and expected forfeiture rates 
for the year ended december   our assumptions and estimates used for the calculated fair value of stock options granted in were as follows january grant may grant estimated fair value per share of options granted assumptions annualized dividend yield risk free rate of return common stock price volatility expected average life of stock options in years historically  our estimates and underlying assumptions have not materially deviated from our actual reported results and rates 
however  we base assumptions we use on our best estimates  which involves inherent uncertainties based on market conditions that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions we use  the stock based compensation expense reported in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of stock based compensation 
for example  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may be required to adjust our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
as of december   using our current assumptions and estimates  we anticipate recognizing million in gross compensation expense through related to unvested stock options outstanding 
if we grant additional stock options in the future  we would be required to recognize additional compensation expense over the vesting period of such stock options in our consolidated statement of operations 
gross compensation expense would equal the calculated fair value of such stock options  which is dependent on the assumptions used to calculate such fair value  but ranges from to of the exercise price multiplied by the number of stock options awarded 
as of december   we had  shares available for grant in the future 

table of contents contingencies and litigation each quarter  we evaluate the need to establish a reserve for any legal claims or assessments 
we base our evaluation on our best estimates of the potential liability in such matters 
the legal reserve includes an estimated amount for any damages and the probability of losing any threatened legal claims or assessments 
the legal reserve is developed in consultation with our general and outside counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our legal reserves and accruals are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
if actual results differ  if circumstances change  or if we experience an unanticipated adverse outcome of any legal action  including any claim or assessment  we would be required to recognize the estimated amount that could reduce net income  earnings per share  and cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase investments as hedges or for purposes other than trading that are likely to expose us to certain types of market risk  including interest rate  commodity price  or equity price risk 
although we have investments  we believe there has been no material change in our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have not issued any debt instruments  entered into any forward or futures contracts  purchased any options  or entered into any swap agreements 
we are exposed  however  to other market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
because the change in value of the united states dollar measured against foreign currency may affect our consolidated financial results  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could positively or negatively affect our results as expressed in the united states dollars 
for example  when the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies in which our products are sold or weakens against foreign currencies in which we may incur costs  our consolidated net sales or related costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our consolidated operations or profitability 
we expanded into canada in  into australia in  into the united kingdom in  into japan in  into new zealand in  into the republic of korea in  into taiwan and denmark in  into germany in  into south africa and singapore in  into austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden in  into mexico  the czech republic  estonia  finland  namibia and the republic of ireland in and into hong kong and the ukraine in we translate our revenues and expenses in foreign markets using an average rate 
we maintain policies  procedures  and internal processes in an effort to help monitor any significant market risks and we do not use any financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we assess the anticipated foreign currency working capital requirements of our foreign operations and maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies sufficient to satisfy most of these anticipated requirements 
we caution that we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to such currency exchange rate fluctuations or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  operating expenses  and on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  to combat such market risk  we closely monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
the regions and countries in which we currently have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk include i north america canada and mexico  ii emea austria  the czech republic  denmark  estonia  finland  germany  the republic of ireland  the netherlands  norway  south africa  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom  iii asia pacific australia  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  singapore  and taiwan 
the current spot rate  average currency exchange rates  and the low and high of such currency exchange rates as compared to the united states dollar  for each of these countries as of and for the year ended december  were as follows year ended december  as of december  country foreign currency name low high average spot australia dollar austria  germany  the netherlands  estonia  finland  and the republic of ireland euro canada dollar czech republic koruna denmark krone japan yen mexico peso new zealand dollar norway krone republic of korea won singapore dollar south africa rand sweden krona switzerland franc taiwan dollar united kingdom british pound
