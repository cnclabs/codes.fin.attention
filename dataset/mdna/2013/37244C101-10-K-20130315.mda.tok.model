item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this report 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
business overview we are a global healthcare company that provides actionable genomic information to personalize cancer treatment decisions 
we offer our oncotype dx tests as a clinical laboratory service  where we analyze the expression levels of genes in tumor tissue samples and provide physicians with a quantitative gene expression profile expressed as a single quantitative score  which we call a recurrence score for invasive breast cancer and colon cancer  and a dcis score for ductal carcinoma in situ  or dcis 
in january  we launched our first oncotype dx test  which is used to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit in early stage invasive breast cancer patients 
in january  we launched our second oncotype dx test  the first multigene expression test developed to assess risk of recurrence in stage ii colon cancer patients 
in late december  we made oncotype dx available for patients with dcis  a pre invasive form of breast cancer 
in june  we extended our offering of the oncotype dx colon cancer test to patients with stage iii disease treated with oxaliplatin containing adjuvant therapy 
as discussed in greater detail below  we currently intend to launch a test for prostate cancer in effective july   the list price of our oncotype dx breast cancer test increased from  to  and the list price of our oncotype dx colon cancer test increased from  to  the majority of our historical revenues have been derived from the sale of oncotype dx breast cancer tests ordered by physicians in the united states 
for the year ended december   more than  oncotype dx test reports were delivered for use in treatment planning  compared to more than  and  test reports delivered for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all of our tests are conducted at our clinical reference laboratory in redwood city  california 
our clinical reference laboratory processing capacity is currently approximately  tests per calendar quarter 
as test processing for our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests is essentially the same  except that the tests use different rna extraction methods and analyze different genes  we believe that we currently have sufficient capacity to process both of our tests 
in connection with the planned launch of our prostate cancer test  we will be expanding our clinical laboratory processing capacity 
we expect our initial commercialization efforts of our prostate cancer test will result in increased costs for laboratory testing  including staffing related costs  incremental sales and marketing staffing to introduce our product to a new group of physicians and costs associated with obtaining reimbursement coverage 
we depend upon third party payors to provide reimbursement for our tests 
accordingly  we have and expect to continue to focus substantial resources on obtaining reimbursement coverage from third party payors 

table of contents we have continued to expand our business  both in the united states and internationally 
we plan to continue to use essentially the same business model internationally as we use in the united states  however  there are significant differences between countries that need to be considered 
for example  different countries may have a public healthcare system  a combination of public and private healthcare system or a cash based payment system 
we have a direct commercial presence with employees and consultants in some countries  including canada  germany  ireland  japan  switzerland and the united kingdom 
additionally  we have entered into exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of our tests with approximately distributors covering more than countries outside of the united states 
we expect that international sales of our oncotype dx tests will be heavily dependent on the availability of reimbursement and sample access 
in many countries  governments are primarily responsible for reimbursing diagnostic tests 
governments often have significant discretion in determining whether a test will be reimbursed at all  and if so  how much will be paid 
in addition  certain countries  such as china  have prohibitions against exporting tissue samples which will limit our ability to offer our tests in those countries without local facilities or a method of test delivery which does not require samples to be transported to our us facility 
the majority of our international oncotype dx breast and colon cancer test revenues come from direct payor reimbursement  payments from our distributors  patient self pay  and clinical collaborations in various countries 
we have obtained some coverage for our breast cancer test outside of the united states  including in canada  germany  greece  ireland  israel  saudi arabia  spain and the united kingdom 
we expect that it will take several years to establish broad coverage and reimbursement for our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests with payors in countries outside of the united states and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
oncotype dx breast cancer test we expect to continue to focus substantial resources on pursuing global adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx breast cancer test 
we believe increased demand for our oncotype dx breast cancer test resulted from our ongoing commercial efforts  expanded utility for new breast cancer patient groups  continued publication of peer reviewed articles on studies we sponsored  conducted or collaborated on that support the use of and reimbursement for the test  clinical presentations at major symposia  and the inclusion of our breast cancer test in clinical practice guidelines for node negative  or n  estrogen receptor positive  or er  invasive disease 
however  this increased demand is not necessarily indicative of future growth rates  and we cannot provide assurance that this level of increased demand can be sustained or that publication of articles  future appearances or presentations at medical conferences  increased commercial efforts or expansion of utility to new breast cancer patient groups will have a similar impact on demand for our breast cancer test in the future 
sequential quarterly demand for our breast cancer test may also be impacted by other factors  including the economic environment and continued high unemployment levels  seasonal variations that have historically impacted physician office visits  our shift in commercial focus to our various oncotype dx cancer tests or any future products we may develop  patient enrollment in oncotype dx clinical studies and the number of clinical trials in process by cooperative groups or makers of other tests conducting experience studies 
most national and regional third party payors in the united states  along with the designated national medicare contractor for our tests  have issued positive coverage determinations for our oncotype dx breast cancer test for patients with node negative  or n  estrogen receptor positive  or er  invasive disease through contracts  agreements or policy decisions 
the local carrier with jurisdiction for claims submitted by us for medicare patients also provides coverage for our breast cancer test for er patients with node positive  or n  disease up to three positive lymph nodes and invasive breast cancer patients where a lymph node status is unknown or not accessible due to a prior surgical procedure  or when the test is used to guide a neoadjuvant treatment decision 
additionally  some payors provide policy coverage for the use of our test in er patients with n disease  including lymph node micro metastasis greater than 
table of contents mm  but not greater than mm in size 
in july  the american journal of managed care published results of an economic assessment suggesting use of oncotype dx in breast cancer patients with positive nodes may improve health outcomes without adding incremental cost 
however  we may not be able to obtain reimbursement coverage from other payors for our test for breast cancer patients with n  er disease 
in late december  we made oncotype dx available for patients with dcis  a pre invasive form of breast cancer 
the launch of oncotype dx for dcis patients was based upon presented positive results from a clinical validation study of oncotype dx breast cancer test in patients with dcis  conducted by the eastern cooperative oncology group  or ecog  a clinical trials cooperative group supported by the national cancer institute 
the study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that a pre specified oncotype dx dcis score derived from the oncotype dx breast cancer test outperforms traditional clinical and pathologic measures to predict the risk of local recurrence  defined as either the development of a new invasive breast cancer or the recurrence of dcis in the same breast 
we expect that it may take several years to establish coverage with a majority of public and private payors for use of our test in dcis patients and we may not be able to obtain such coverage 
oncotype dx colon cancer test we expect to continue to focus substantial resources on pursuing global adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test 
we believe the key factors that will drive further adoption of this test include results from additional studies we sponsor  conduct or collaborate on that support the use of and increased coverage and reimbursement for the test  clinical presentations at major symposia  publications and our ongoing commercial efforts 
in june  at the american society of clinical oncology  or asco  annual meeting  a second large study confirming that the oncotype dx colon cancer test independently predicts individualized recurrence risk for stage ii colon cancer was presented 
in november  positive results from the quasar clinical validation study were published online by the journal of clinical oncology 
current or future studies of our colon cancer test may lead to inclusion of the test in clinical guidelines and as standard of care for indicated patients 
effective september   the designated national medicare contractor for our tests established a formal coverage policy for our oncotype dx colon cancer test for patients with stage ii colon cancer 
we are working with additional public and private payors and health plans to secure coverage for our colon cancer test based upon clinical evidence showing the utility of the test  and we have obtained reimbursement coverage for our oncotype dx colon cancer test from certain other third party payors 
as a relatively new test  our colon cancer test may be considered investigational by payors and therefore may not be covered under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we intend to pursue case by case reimbursement and expect that this test will continue to be reviewed on this basis until policy decisions have been made by individual payors 
we believe it may take several years to achieve reimbursement with a majority of third party payors for our colon cancer test 
however  we cannot predict whether  at what rate  or under what circumstances  payors will reimburse for this test 
based upon our experience in obtaining adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx breast cancer test  we do not expect product revenues from our colon cancer test to comprise more than of our total revenues for at least the next year or more 
in june  based on the positive results of the nsabp c validation study  which we presented in september at the european society for medical oncology congress  we began offering the oncotype dx colon cancer test for use in patients with stage iii disease treated with oxaliplatin containing adjuvant therapy 
in an exploratory component of the nsabp c clinical trial  researchers analyzed over new genes and identified genes as being predictive of oxaliplatin benefit when added to adjuvant therapy for 
table of contents use in patients with stage iii colon cancer 
we plan to utilize these results and initiate a validation study in oncotype dx prostate cancer test in february  at the asco genitourinary cancer symposium and the united states and canadian academy of pathology meeting  we presented positive full results from our prostate cancer gene identification study 
the study  which applied the same reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  or rt pcr  technology used in our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests  identified genes strongly associated with clinical recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy 
in june  we presented results of our first development study in prostate tissue obtained from needle biopsies 
the study  an analysis of biopsy samples from men with conventionally defined low intermediate risk prostate cancer  showed that genes and biological pathways associated with clinically aggressive prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens can be reliably measured by quantitative rt pcr from fixed prostate needle biopsies 
based on the results of this and multiple prior studies  we initiated a large clinical validation study in early in september  we announced positive topline results from this clinical validation study of our biopsy based prostate cancer test 
as a result of this clinical validation study meeting its primary end point  we are completing the necessary work in our clinical reference laboratory in order to proceed with a worldwide commercial launch of our prostate cancer test in we expect to incur additional expenses related to the planned commercial launch of our prostate cancer test  such as infrastructure costs  information technology costs  and selling and marketing costs 
based upon our experience in obtaining adoption and reimbursement for our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests  we do not expect product revenues from our prostate cancer test to comprise more than of our total revenues for at least a year or more following our launch 
product development opportunities in addition to developing products to address new cancer areas  we continually look to expand the clinical utility and addressable patient populations for our existing cancer tests 
these developments efforts may lead to a wide variety of possible new products covering various treatment decisions  including risk assessment  screening and prevention  early disease diagnosis  adjuvant disease diagnosis  metatastic treatment selection  and treatment monitoring 
future products may address a specific clinical need or guide a targeted therapy decision and may also leverage our ngs capabilities to expand our product opportunities 
technology in our oncotype dx platform we utilize existing technologies  such as rt pcr  and information technologies and optimize and integrate them into new processes 
we are also incorporating new technologies  such as high throughput next generation sequencing  or ngs  in our research and development laboratory 
ngs technologies parallelize the sequencing process  producing millions of sequences at once 
these technologies are intended to provide dna and rna sequence information in greater amounts and at lower cost than standard methods 
we have created proprietary methods for ngs 
table of contents analysis of fixed paraffin embedded  or fpe  tissue nucleic acids  created bioinformatics programs and infrastructure for data storage and analysis  and plan to rely on ngs as the technological source of new biomarkers in the future 
we expect to continue to develop the capabilities of various technologies to create new products 
economic environment continuing concerns over prolonged high unemployment levels  the availability and cost of credit  the us real estate market  federal budget negotiations  proposed regulatory changes and taxation issues  inflation  deflation  energy costs and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and uncertain expectations both for the us and global economies 
these factors  combined with uncertainties in business and consumer confidence  a volatile stock market  the european sovereign debt crisis  continued concerns regarding the stability of the euro currency and some european union member countries and slowing growth in china  have precipitated an economic slowdown and expectations of slower global economic growth and possibly another recession going forward 
we periodically evaluate the impact of this environment on our cash management  cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments  and we expect that we will continue to be able to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities 
we periodically monitor the financial position of our significant third party payors  which include medicare and managed care companies 
as of the date of this report  we do not expect the current economic environment to have a material negative impact on our ability to collect payments from third party payors in the foreseeable future 
the economic environment continued to impact growth in tests delivered and revenue generated during the year ended december  we intend to continue to assess the impact of the economic environment on our business activities 
if the economic environment does not improve or deteriorates  our business including our patient population  government and third party payors and our distributors and suppliers could be negatively affected  resulting in a negative impact on our product revenues 
us healthcare environment the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or  collectively  the ppaca  enacted in march  makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and clinical laboratories 
the ppaca contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund expanded health insurance coverage  including new fees or taxes on certain health related industries  including medical device manufacturers 
beginning in  each medical device manufacturer will have to pay sales tax in an amount equal to of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices that are listed with the fda 
although the food and drug administration  or fda  has contended that clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use  referred to as ldts  such as our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests  are medical devices  none of our products are currently listed with the fda 
we cannot assure you that the tax will not be extended to services such as ours in the future 
the ppaca also mandates a reduction in payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule  or clfs  of through and a productivity adjustment to the clfs 
in addition  the ppaca establishes a board that is charged with reducing the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending 
we are monitoring the impact of the ppaca in order to enable us to determine the trends and changes that may be necessitated by the legislation that may potentially impact on our business over time 

table of contents in february  congress passed the middle class tax relief and job creation act of which in part reduced the potential future cost based increases to the medicare clfs by 
overall  the total fee cut to the clfs for is not including a further reduction of anticipated from implementation of the automatic expense reductions sequester under the budget control act of which will go into effect for dates of service on or after april  unless congress acts to modify the automatic cuts 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms  sought public input through the notice and comment period for the proposed medicare physician fee schedule  on whether all new ama molecular diagnostic codes be placed on either the medicare physician fee schedule  which would likely require a patient co payment for such services  or remain on the clfs 
on november   cms issued a final rule on the physican fee schedule which stated that these new codes would be placed on the clfs 
on august   cms also issued a preliminary determination for the clfs which proposed not to recognize multi analyte codes with algorithmic analyses  or maaa  and questioned whether algorithm based tests are covered benefits for medicare beneficiaries 
however  in its final determination released on november   cms deleted the statement about not covering algorithmic analysis  and stated that laboratories performing maaa tests for medicare beneficiaries should continue to bill for these tests in as they are currently billed under the clfs 
cms intends to consider its payment policy for maaas again in and may issue a determination to pay or not pay for these tests beginning in our current medicare reimbursement determination was set by a local coverage decision and not set nationally by cms 
these or any future changes in covered benefit determination  proposed fees or mandated reductions in payments may apply to some or all of our clinical laboratory tests delivered to medicare beneficiaries 
changes in medicare administrative contractor mac services on a five year rotational basis  medicare requests bids for its regional mac services 
in  we were notified of the transition from our initial mac to palmetto gba as a result of this bidding process 
palmetto gba has issued coverage and payment determinations on our oncotype dx tests since that transition 
in september  medicare notified us that the next successor mac for our region will be noridian administrative services 
we have been informed that a transition will not take place before june but we have not been advised of the specific timing of the transition 
a change in the mac processing medicare claims for our oncotype dx tests could impact the coverage or payment rates for our current tests and our ability to obtain medicare coverage for products for which we do not yet have coverage or any products we may launch in the future 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we determine whether revenue is recognized on an accrual basis when test results are delivered or on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor 
our revenues for tests performed are recognized on an accrual basis when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the nature of the fee charged for the products or services delivered and existing contractual arrangements 
when evaluating collectability  we consider whether we have sufficient history to reliably estimate a payor individual payment patterns 
based upon at least several months of payment history  we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed and the payor outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the contracted payment amount 
to the extent all criteria set forth above are not met  including where there is no evidence of payment history at the time test results are delivered  product revenues are recognized on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor 
we enter into exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of one or more of our oncotype dx tests with distributors outside of the united states 
in these countries  the distributor generally provides us with certain marketing and administrative services within its territory 
as a condition of these agreements  the distributor generally pays us an agreed upon fee per test and we process the tests 
the same revenue recognition criteria described above generally apply to tests received through distributors 
to the extent all criteria set forth above are not met when test results are delivered  product revenues are generally recognized when cash is received from the distributor 
test revenue recognized on an accrual basis is recorded upon delivery of each test performed  net of any contractual discount at the amount that we expect to collect 
we determine the amount we expect to collect on a per payor  per contract or arrangement basis  based on our analysis of historical average payments 
this average amount is typically lower than the agreed upon amount due to several factors  such as the amount of patient co payments  the existence of secondary payors and claim denials 
we typically review our analysis annually  or at the time a contractual price change is implemented or when information comes to our attention that leads us to believe an adjustment may be warranted 
as of december   amounts outstanding for tests delivered  net of write downs and adjustments  which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and which had not been collected  totaled approximately million 
we cannot provide any assurance as to when  if ever  and to what extent these amounts will be collected 
from time to time  we receive requests for refunds of payments  generally due to overpayments made by third party payors 
upon becoming aware of a refund request  we establish an accrued liability for tests covered by the refund request until such time as we determine whether or not a refund is due 
if we determine that a refund is due  we credit cash and reduce the accrued liability 
accrued refunds were  and  at december  and  respectively 
contract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract specific basis 
under certain contracts  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed 
we may exercise judgment when estimating full time equivalent level of effort  costs incurred and time to project completion 
for certain contracts  we utilize the performance based method of revenue recognition  which requires that we estimate the total amount of costs to be expended for a project and recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs expended to date 
the estimated total costs to be expended are necessarily subject to revision from time to time as the underlying facts and circumstances change 

table of contents accounts receivable we accrue an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable based on estimates consistent with historical payment experience 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated quarterly and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
historically  the amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable that have been written off have been consistent with management expectations 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience higher than expected write offs in the future 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information  including a summary of accounts receivable aging by payor mix 
research and development expenses we enter into collaboration and clinical trial agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses 
we record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  may vary from contract to contract  and may result in uneven payment flows 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical development personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services provided and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
all potential future product programs outside of breast and colon cancer  and our prostate cancer test expected to launch in  are in the research or development phase 
although we have estimated the time frame in which some of these products may be brought to market  the timing is uncertain given the technical challenges and clinical variables that exist between different types of cancers 
we maintain information regarding costs incurred for activities performed under certain contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
however  we do not generally record or maintain information regarding costs incurred in research and development on a program specific basis 
our research and development staff and associated infrastructure resources are deployed across several programs 
many of our costs are thus not attributable to individual programs 
as a result  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development programs or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
stock based compensation expense we measure all stock based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  based on their relative fair values 
fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan  or espp  were estimated at grant or purchase rights offering dates using a black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense related to stock option grants is estimated at the date of grant and stock based compensation expense related to espp purchases is estimated at the beginning of each offering period based on these fair value calculations 
the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
the application of option valuation models requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions used in determining fair value 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of estimates such as stock price volatility and expected option lives to value stock based compensation 
our assumptions regarding expected volatility are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected life of options is estimated based on historical option exercise data and assumptions related to unsettled options 
the expected life of stock issuable pursuant to the espp is six months  or the duration of the purchase period 
expected forfeiture rates for stock option grants are based on historical data  and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results 
we do not include expected forfeiture rates when calculating stock based 
table of contents compensation expense for stock issuable pursuant to the espp due to the short duration of the purchase period  however  we do adjust the expense for actual results 
stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock unit  or rsu  awards is based on the market value of our common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
expected forfeiture rates for rsus are based on historical data  and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results 
we review our valuation assumptions on an ongoing basis  and  as a result  our assumptions used to value stock awards granted in future periods may change 
see note  stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for more information 
deferred tax assets we are required to reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must use judgment in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance  which requires an evaluation of both negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance  if any  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income  estimates of future income and tax planning strategies 
as a result of historical cumulative losses and  based on all available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that our recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets at both december  and december  we will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a basic per share basis  net income was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a diluted per share basis  net income was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we may incur net losses in future periods due to future spending and fluctuations in our business  and we may not maintain profit levels in the future 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from product sales and  to a lesser extent  from contract research arrangements 
we operate in one industry segment 
as of december   substantially all of our product revenues have been derived from the sale of our oncotype dx invasive breast cancer test 
payors are billed upon generation and delivery of test results to the physician 
product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or arrangement to pay is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectability is reasonably assured 
contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with 
table of contents biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded as revenue when contractual obligations are completed 
year ended december  in thousands product revenues contract revenues total revenues year over year dollar increase in product revenues year over year percentage increase in product revenues the year over year increases in product revenues resulted from increased adoption  as primarily evidenced by a increase in test volume for the year ended december  and a increase in test volume for the year ended december  we also experienced and increases in international revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately million  or  of product revenues for the year ended december   was recorded on an accrual basis and recognized at the time the test results were delivered  compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for all periods  the balance of product revenues was recognized upon cash collection as payments were received 
product revenues related to medicare patients for the year ended december  were million  or  of product revenues  compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no other third party payors comprising product revenues of or more for those years 
international product revenues were million  or of product revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product revenues for the year ended december  were affected by delayed receipt of approximately million in payments from two third party payors 
the delays  which adversely impacted revenues for  resulted from interruptions in payments due to contract and documentation requirements  which were resolved and recorded in the first half of the timing of recognition of revenue related to these and other third party payments may cause fluctuations in product revenues from period to period 
contract revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract revenues represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners 
the decrease in contract revenues for compared to was due primarily to a million decrease in ongoing activities related to our collaboration with pfizer inc we expect that our contract revenues will continue to fluctuate based on the number and timing of studies being conducted 

table of contents cost of product revenues year ended december  in thousands tissue sample processing costs stock based compensation total tissue sample processing costs license fees total cost of product revenues year over year dollar increase decrease year over year percentage increase decrease cost of product revenues represents the cost of materials  direct labor  equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing tissue samples including sample accessioning  histopathology  anatomical pathology  paraffin extraction  rt pcr  quality control analyses and shipping charges to transport tissue samples and license fees 
infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
costs associated with performing our test are recorded as tests are processed 
costs recorded for tissue sample processing represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test 
royalties for licensed technology calculated as a percentage of product revenues and fixed annual payments relating to the launch and commercialization of oncotype dx tests are recorded as license fees in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations 
while license fees are generally calculated as a percentage of product revenues  the percentage increase in license fees does not correlate exactly to the percentage increase in product revenues because certain agreements contain provisions for fixed annual payments and other agreements have tiered rates and payments that may be capped at annual minimum or maximum amounts 
license fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
tissue sample processing costs increased million  or  in compared to  and million  or  in compared to  driven by increases in test volume of and in and  respectively  which were partially offset by cost controls and efficiency gains 
license fees decreased  or  in compared to and million  or  in compared to license fees for the year ended december  included an  reduction from a payment received under a legal settlement related to the abandonment of a patent and a million reduction in license fees from the execution of an amendment to our pcr license agreement that reduces the rate paid on pcr based product revenues recorded after july  license fees for the year ended december included the full year effect of the amendment to our pcr license agreement  partially offset by an increase in license fees resulting from increased year over year product revenues 
we expect the cost of product revenues to increase in future periods to the extent we process more tests 

table of contents research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses stock based compensation collaboration expenses reagents and laboratory supplies allocated information technology  facilities and other costs other costs total research and development expenses year over year dollar increase decrease year over year percentage increase decrease research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology  such as ngs and continuous process improvement  and carry out clinical studies  primarily related to our ongoing work in breast  colon and prostate cancer 
research and development expenses include personnel related expenses  reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work  infrastructure expenses  including allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs  contract services and other outside costs 
research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
the million  or  increase in research and development expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in allocated information technology  facilities and other costs  a  increase in stock based compensation  a  increase in reagents and laboratory supplies and a  increase in other costs  partially offset by a decrease in collaboration expenses of  of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to increases in salaries  benefits and related expenses  and  was related to higher bonus payments 
the million  or  increase in research and development expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in allocated information technology  facilities and other costs  a  increase in collaboration expense  a  increase in other costs  a  increase in reagents and laboratory supplies expense  and a  increase in stock based compensation 
of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to increases in salaries  benefits and related expenses  and  was related to higher bonus payments 
the increase in personnel related expenses for both and were primarily attributable to increased headcount to support projects related to our pipeline and ongoing work in next generation sequencing  or ngs 
the decrease in collaboration expenses for compared to was primarily due to the completion of several domestic collaboration studies in or early focusing on dcis  prostate and colon cancers  partially offset by new studies launching in the second half of focusing on breast and renal cancers

we also lease  square feet of space in geneva  switzerland

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we achieved positive operating cash flow for the years ended december   and we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with payments for our oncotype dx tests  will be sufficient to fund our operations and facilities expansion plans for at least the next months  including the expansion of our research and development programs  our ngs development efforts  our efforts to expand adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer and dcis tests  the planned launch of our oncotype dx prostate cancer test and our international expansion efforts

we expect that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will also be used to fund working capital and for other general 
table of contents corporate purposes  such as licensing technology rights  distribution arrangements for our tests both within and outside of the united states or expanding our direct sales capabilities outside of the us the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the amount of cash provided by our operations  the progress of our commercialization efforts  product development  regulatory requirements  progress in reimbursement for our tests and available strategic opportunities for acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
we cannot be certain that our international expansion plans  efforts to expand adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon and dcis cancer tests or the development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these activities through to a successful result 
it may take years to move any one of a number of product candidates in research through development and validation to commercialization 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the rate of progress in establishing and maintaining reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international third party payors  the cost of expanding our commercial and laboratory operations  including our selling and marketing efforts  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of our oncotype dx breast  colon and prostate cancer tests  the rate of progress and cost of selling and marketing activities associated with expanding adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon and dcis cancer tests  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with products in research and development focused on cancers other than breast and colon cancer  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with next generation sequencing  the cost of acquiring  licensing or investing in technologies  including next generation sequencing  the cost of acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or assets  costs related to the planned launch of our oncotype dx prostate cancer test and other future product launches  the cost of acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  costs related to international expansion  costs and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products or operations  the impact of changes in federal  state and international taxation  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaborations  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter or investments or acquisitions we might seek to effect 
if we are not able to generate and maintain sustained product revenues to finance our cash requirements  we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity 
table of contents offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may result 
any equity securities issued may also provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds by issuing debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
the terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
the credit market and financial services industry have in the past  and may in the future  experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  on acceptable terms  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives 
in addition  we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our product or market development programs  which could lower the economic value of those programs to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance requiring companies to present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two consecutive statements 
this guidance eliminates the option for companies to present other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
we were required to adopt this guidance in as this guidance provides only presentation requirements  the adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to authoritative guidance for measuring fair value when required or permitted by other accounting standards 
the amendments are intended to result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and international financial reporting standards 
some of the amendments clarify the fasb intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
we were required to adopt this guidance in as this guidance provides only presentation requirements  the adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
our investment policy provides for investments in short term  low risk  investment grade debt instruments 
our investments in marketable securities  which are comprised primarily of money market funds  obligations of us government agencies and government sponsored entities  commercial paper and corporate bonds  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  totaling million at december   did not include any auction preferred stock  auction rate securities or mortgage backed investments 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  and we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
the securities in our investment portfolio are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
to date  we have not experienced a 
table of contents loss of principal on any of our investments 
although we currently expect that our ability to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities will continue  we cannot ensure that this will not change 
we believe that  if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the impact on the fair value of these securities or our cash flows or income would not be material 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our revenues are recognized in us dollars 
certain expenses related to our international activities are payable in foreign currencies 
as a result  factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets will affect our financial results 
we recognized net foreign exchange transaction losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the us dollar  so we are not currently subject to gains and losses from foreign currency translation of the subsidiary financial statements 
we currently do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has been immaterial in the past  there can be no guarantee the impact of currency fluctuations related to our international activities will not be material in the future
