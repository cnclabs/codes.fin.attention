item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald s restaurants 
of the  restaurants in countries at year end   were franchised or licensed including  franchised to conventional franchisees   licensed to developmental licensees and  licensed to foreign affiliates affiliates primarily japan and  were operated by the company 
under our conventional franchise arrangement  franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment  signs  seating and d cor of their restaurant business  and by reinvesting in the business over time 
the company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites 
this maintains long term occupancy rights  helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees 
in certain circumstances  the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants 
under our developmental license arrangement  licensees provide capital for the entire business  including the real estate interest  and the company has no capital invested 
in addition  the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market 
we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great  locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability 
however  directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience 
in our company operated restaurants  and in collaboration with franchisees  we further develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants 
we continually review  and as appropriate adjust  our mix of company operated and franchised or licensed conventional franchised  developmental licensed and foreign affiliated restaurants to help optimize overall performance 
the company s revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees 
revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments  and initial fees 
revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales  and generally include initial fees 
fees vary by type of site  amount of company investment  if any  and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise license agreements that generally have year terms 
the business is managed as distinct geographic segments 
significant reportable segments include the united states us  europe  and asia pacific  middle east and africa apmea 
in addition  throughout this report we present other countries corporate that includes operations in canada and latin america  as well as corporate activities 
the us  europe and apmea segments account for  and of total revenues  respectively 
the united kingdom uk  france and germany  collectively  account for of europe s revenues  and china  australia and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  collectively  account for of apmea s revenues 
these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise of total revenues 
in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures  including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth  systemwide sales growth and returns 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the company s underlying business trends 
comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions  respectively  from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants  whether operated by the company or franchisees  in operation at least thirteen months  including those temporarily closed 
some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling  rebuilding  road construction and natural disasters 
comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation 
comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check  which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix 
generally  the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check 
mcdonald s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month  quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days 
the number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts 
the company refers to these impacts as calendar shift trading day adjustments 
in addition  the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts 
these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal 
systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants 
while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company  management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base 
return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization numerator by the cash used for investing activities denominator  primarily capital expenditures 
the calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation 
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment between the company  its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald success 
this business model enables mcdonald to consistently deliver locally relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve 
in addition  it facilitates our ability to identify  implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences 
mcdonald corporation annual report mcdonald customer focused plan to win plan provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation 
through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five pillars of our plan people  products  place  price and promotion we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown global comparable sales and guest counts in each of the last nine years 
this plan  combined with financial discipline  has delivered strong results for our shareholders since its inception 
to measure our performance as we continue to build the business  we have the following long term  average annual constant currency financial targets systemwide sales growth of to  operating income growth of to  roiic in the high teens 
prior to  we exceeded each of these financial targets every year since the plan implementation in  after adjusting for the loss in from the latin america developmental license transaction 
these targets have enabled us to make the best decisions for the long term benefit of our shareholders  and we believe they remain realistic and sustainable for a company of our size 
in  systemwide sales growth was in constant currencies  operating income growth was in constant currencies  one year roiic was and three year roiic was see reconciliation on page 
persistent global economic headwinds  heightened competitive activity and inflationary costs impacted results 
in addition  planned strategic decisions  such as the london olympics sponsorship  investing in technology and the biennial worldwide owner operator convention  also impacted results 
in  we continued to focus on customers needs and remained aligned on our plan and the three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu  modernizing the customer experience  and broadening accessibility to our brand 
we believe these priorities are relevant and actionable  and combined with our competitive advantages  will drive long term sustainable growth 
initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with customers and drove increases in global comparable sales and guest counts of and  respectively  despite challenging economies and a relatively flat or declining informal eating out ieo segment in most markets 
in  we continued to grow market share in the us  europe and apmea  amid a more competitive global environment and a slight decline in our fourth quarter comparable guest counts 
comparable sales are impacted by guest counts  product mix shifts and menu pricing 
specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors  notably food away from home and food at home inflation indices 
in our company operated restaurants  we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points  increase profitability and mitigate inflation  all while trying to grow guest counts 
in order to accomplish these objectives  we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price and product mix 
franchisees also have access to  and many utilize  this strategic pricing tool 
in general  we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy 
we look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entry point value  core  premium and promotional offerings 
we also introduce new products to meet customers needs  which can expand average check and increase guest counts 
in  average prices increased at company operated restaurants in each area of the world  although increases varied by market and region 
us in the us  comparable sales increased for the tenth consecutive year  rising in  while comparable guest counts rose 
these results were achieved despite only modest growth in the ieo segment and heightened competitive activity 
in the second half of the year  we experienced softer performance  therefore  we adjusted our plans to re energize our all day everyday value offerings while providing the menu variety customers expect from mcdonald 
in  we continued to highlight beverages  value  breakfast  and our classic core favorites 
we expanded our mccaf beverage offerings with the chocolate chip frapp and cherry berry chiller 
limited time offers  such as chicken mcbites and the cheddar bacon onion premium sandwiches  complemented our core menu offerings 
modernizing the customer experience continued through our major remodeling initiative  which provides contemporary restaurant designs and retailing efforts 
the enhanced appearance and functionality of our restaurants deliver a more relevant experience for our customers 
over existing restaurants were remodeled during with the majority adding drive thru capacity to capture additional guest counts 
we broadened the accessibility of our convenient locations through extended hours and efficient drive thru service 
more than half of our restaurants use some form of multiple order points to maximize drive thru capacity  including  with hand held order takers to help improve customer service times 
to further build on our competitive advantage  we focused on operations excellence initiatives to drive customer satisfaction as we strive to deliver fast  accurate and friendly service with every order 
europe in europe  comparable sales rose  marking the ninth consecutive year of comparable sales increases  while guest counts declined 
while low consumer confidence continues to negatively affect overall retail sales and the ieo segment  we outperformed the market and grew market share 
major contributors to comparable sales were the uk and russia 
despite ongoing economic challenges  the segment priority remains growing the overall business by balancing a strong focus on our unique value offerings  ongoing premium product innovation  and new products 
europe continued to see the benefit of providing a relevant  contemporary customer experience and completed almost restaurant reimages 
by the end of  over of restaurant interiors and approximately of exteriors had been reimaged 
europe also invested in a roll out of a new point of sale system  which allows us to continue to expand our menu offerings and improve order accuracy 
by the end of  over  restaurants had deployed this system 
we expanded our coffee business and have over  mccaf locations  which in europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees  desserts and snacks 
in addition  we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours  self order kiosks  optimized drive thrus  and opened over new restaurants 
apmea in apmea  comparable sales rose and comparable guest counts rose  despite a challenging year of economic pressures  partly due to japan uneven recovery and china slower economic growth 
positive performance was driven by china  australia and many other markets 
unique value platforms  great tasting premium menu selections  locally relevant menu variety  and convenience and service enhancements differentiated the mcdonald experience 
australia launched the loose change menu  which is a branded affordability menu  while china focused on breakfast  lunch  and dinner value platforms 
value initiatives were balanced with mid tier offers  such as bubble tea in china  and premium limited time offers  such as the serious lamb burger and wrap in australia 
mcdonald corporation annual report our breakfast business has expanded and is offered in approximately of apmea restaurants 
desserts continued to play a meaningful role  particularly in china  where we remain one of the largest ice cream retailers 
we opened over new restaurants in apmea  of which over were in china  where we have made significant progress toward our goal of  restaurants by the end of nearly two thirds of apmea restaurants are offering some form of extended operating hours and over  restaurants are open hours 
delivery is offered in many apmea markets and is now available in over  restaurants  including nearly in china 
since japan natural disaster in march of  the economy remains a challenge 
despite a declining ieo segment  mcdonald is gaining market share through a value platform of   and yen offerings  and family sharing boxes  such as piece chicken mcnuggets 
japan augmented its value platform with strategic couponing to encourage add on and extra value meal purchases 
consolidated globally  our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and leveraging our scale  supply chain infrastructure and our suppliers risk management practices to manage costs 
we were able to execute our strategies in every area of the world  grow comparable sales and control selling  general and administrative expenses 
however  in we faced top and bottom line pressures  some a result of planned strategic decisions  and others driven by the external environment 
as a result  combined operating margin operating income as a percent of total revenues was in  down percentage points as compared to in  cash from operations was nearly billion 
our substantial cash flow  strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders 
capital expenditures of approximately billion were invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and open new restaurants 
across the system  over  restaurants were opened and about  existing locations were reimaged 
in addition  we returned billion to shareholders consisting of billion in dividends and billion in share repurchases 
cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner operators is a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs 
in addition  the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the company owned model 
we believe locally owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages  making mcdonald not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one 
highlights from the year included comparable sales grew and guest counts rose  building on increases of and  respectively 
revenues increased in constant currencies 
operating income increased in constant currencies 
diluted earnings per share was  an increase of in constant currencies 
cash provided by operations was nearly billion 
one year roiic was and three year roiic was for the period ended december  the company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share to for the fourth quarter bringing our current annual dividend to per share 
the company returned billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
outlook for we will continue to build the business in and beyond by enhancing the customer experience across all pillars of our plan and our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu  modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to our brand

our number one priority continues to be satisfying our customers needs by serving great tasting  high quality food in contemporary restaurants

europe in europe  we see growth opportunities in breakfast  core menu items  beverages  and extended hours 
our business plans are focused on building market share by emphasizing value across all dayparts and new restaurant growth 
in some markets  our value offerings will evolve from a low end entry price to multiple entry prices across our menu

in  we will reimage approximately restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having of our interiors and over of our exteriors reimaged by the end of we will also open nearly restaurants 
we will leverage production and service enhancements by optimizing kitchen platforms and accelerating the deployment of technologies  such as updating the point of sale system and rolling out multiple order points via self order kiosks  hand held order devices and side by side drive thrus 
these initiatives will enhance the customer experience  help drive guest counts and improve labor efficiency 
we will also continue to reduce our impact on the environment with energy management tools

supplemental information regarding company operated restaurants we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance  profits and returns 
in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve these goals  but as previously stated  company operated restaurants are also important to our success 
we report results for company operated restaurants based on their sales  less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs 
we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues  less associated occupancy costs 
for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure  we do not specifically allocate selling  general and administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to company operated or franchised restaurants 
other operating items that relate to the company operated restaurants generally include gains losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we believe the following information about company operated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business 
management of the company considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix  subject to other relevant considerations 
the following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our company operated margins 
the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations  which we refer to as store operating margin 
the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties 
we refer to this component as brand real estate margin 
both company operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties  although rent and royalties for company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation 
rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales  and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald s investment in the restaurant 
royalty rates may also vary by market 
as shown in the following table  in disaggregating the components of our company operated margins  certain costs with respect to company operated restaurants are reflected in brand real estate margin 
those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses  and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brand real estate margin 
while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our company operated business  it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular  as noted previously  we do not allocate selling  general and administrative expenses to our company operated business 
however  we believe that about  per restaurant  on average  is the typical cost to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market 
these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

the company uses major capital markets  bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense

the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all swaps are over the counter instruments 
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated 
the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties  intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates

the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments  but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues  local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 
liquidity the company has significant operations outside the united states where we earn over of our operating income 
a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company mcdonald corporation annual report has made  and will continue to make  substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations 
accordingly  no us federal or state income taxes have been provided on the undistributed foreign earnings 
the company cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately billion as of december  we do not intend  nor do we foresee a need  to repatriate these funds 
consistent with prior years  we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents  domestic cash flows from operations  annual repatriation of a portion of the current period foreign earnings  and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating  investing  and financing activities 
we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating  investing  and financing activities 
in the future  should we require more capital to fund activities in the united states than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt  we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions 
this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future 
while the likelihood is remote  to the extent foreign cash is available  the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  the company may be subject to additional us income taxes net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits which could result in a use of cash 
this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings

the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make tax deferred contributions and ii receive company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of irs limitations 
at december   total liabilities for the supplemental plans were million  and total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were million 
there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction  inventory  energy  marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business 
the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company s financial position 
such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows 
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment  or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
share based compensation the company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions  which impact the assumed fair value  including the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate  expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected mcdonald corporation annual report life and the expected dividend yield 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 
long lived assets impairment review long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of its operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
based on the annual goodwill impairment test  conducted in the fourth quarter  the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 
litigation accruals in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors  customers  employees  franchisees  government agencies  intellectual property  shareholders and suppliers 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies  including the sale of appreciated assets  in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
in  the internal revenue service irs completed its examination of the company us federal income tax returns for and the company and the irs reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the irs 
the agreement did not have a material impact on the company cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
the company and us federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates 
the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management intentions change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided 
effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust menu prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings  many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 
reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
the numerator is the company s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 
the denominator is the weighted average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period 
the weighted average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis 
these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter s investing activities to incremental operating income 
for example  fourth quarter investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations 
in contrast  fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than months ago  and therefore have a full year impact on operating income  with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations  respectively 
management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 
the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year roiic are as follows mcdonald corporation annual report one year roiic calculation dollars in millions years ended december  incremental change numerator operating income depreciation and amortization currency translation incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization at constant foreign exchange rates denominator weighted average cash used for investing activities currency translation weighted average cash used for investing activities at constant foreign exchange rates one year roiic represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured
