item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a reit  for federal income tax purposes  in the business of acquiring  investing in  financing and managing primarily mortgage related assets and  to a lesser extent  financial assets 
our objective is to manage a portfolio of investments that will deliver stable distributions to our stockholders over diverse economic conditions 
we intend to achieve this objective through a combination of net interest margin and net realized capital gains from our investment portfolio 
our portfolio includes  among other things  certain credit sensitive assets and investments in mortgage related and financial assets and agency rmbs  consisting of fixed rate  adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate rmbs  agency ios consisting of interest only and inverse interest only rmbs that represent the right to the interest component of the cash flow from a pool of mortgage loans  multi family cmbs and residential mortgage loans  including loans sourced from distressed markets 
we have endeavored to build in recent years a diversified investment portfolio that includes elements of interest rate and credit risk  as we believe a portfolio diversified among interest rate and credit risks are best suited to delivering stable cash flows over various economic cycles 
under our investment strategy  our targeted assets currently include agency arms  agency fixed rate rmbs  agency ios  multi family cmbs and residential mortgage loans  including loans sourced from distressed markets 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit  we also may opportunistically acquire and manage various other types of mortgage related assets and financial assets that we believe will compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them  including  without limitation  non agency rmbs which may include ios and pos  collateralized mortgage obligations and securities issued by newly originated residential securitizations  including credit sensitive securities from these securitizations 
we strive to maintain and achieve a balanced and diverse funding mix to finance our assets and operations 
to this end  we rely primarily on a combination of short term borrowings  such as repurchase agreements with terms typically of days  and longer term structured financings  such as securitization and re securitization transactions  with terms longer than one year 
we internally manage a certain portion of our portfolio  including agency arms  fixed rate agency rmbs  non agency rmbs  clos and certain residential mortgage loans held in securitization trusts 
in addition  as part of our investment strategy  we also contract with certain external investment managers to manage specific asset types targeted by us 
we are a party to separate investment management agreements with midway  riverbanc and headlands  with midway providing investment management services with respect to our investments in agency ios  riverbanc providing investment management services with respect to our investments in multi family cmbs and certain commercial real estate related debt investments  and headlands providing investment management services with respect to our investments in certain distressed residential mortgage loans

key fourth quarter activity completion of distressed residential mortgage loans securitization transaction on december   through a wholly owned subsidiary  we entered into a securitization transaction with a three year term for the purpose of financing distressed residential mortgage loans owned by us 
as part of the transaction  we transferred the distressed residential mortgage loans having a carrying value of million at december  to a special purpose entity of which we own the equity certificate in exchange for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds of the transaction were generated from the special purpose entity s concurrent private placement of million of notes pursuant to an indenture 
the notes bear interest that is payable monthly at a per annum rate equal to and are scheduled to mature in december  at which time the distressed residential mortgage loans serving as collateral will be transferred back to the company 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the distressed residential mortgage loans serving as collateral for the notes are performing and re performing  fixed and adjustable rate  fully amortizing  interest only and balloon  seasoned mortgage loans secured by first liens on one to four family properties 
headlands has been engaged to serve as external manager of this investment and will receive a base management and incentive fees that will be calculated in a manner similar to the company s other investment management agreements for its management of such assets 
completion of multi family cmbs collateralized recourse financing transaction in november  through a wholly owned subsidiary  we entered into a master repurchase agreement the cmbs master repurchase agreement with a three year term for the purpose of financing certain multi family cmbs owned by us 
pursuant to the terms of the cmbs master repurchase agreement  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company transferred multi family cmbs having an estimated carrying value of approximately million at december  to a trust in exchange for net proceeds to us of million 
the proceeds of the transaction to us were generated from the concurrent private placement of million of notes by the trust pursuant to an indenture 
the notes bear interest that is payable monthly at a per annum rate equal to one month libor plus 
the notes and the financing under the cmbs master repurchase agreement are scheduled to mature in november in connection with the transaction  we agreed to guarantee the due and punctual payment of our subsidiary s obligations under the cmbs master repurchase agreement 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the multi family cmbs serving as collateral under the cmbs master repurchase agreement are comprised of securities issued from four separate freddie mac sponsored multi family k series cmbs securitizations  including the multi family cmbs discussed below in multi family cmbs investments 
multi family cmbs investments on october   we completed the purchase of the first loss floating rate security issued by a freddie mac sponsored multi family loan securitization for approximately million 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from our october public stock offering to fund the purchase price of this security 
in addition  during the quarter ended december   we purchased first loss po securities and certain io securities from two additional freddie mac sponsored multi family loan securitizations for approximately million 
we financed our purchases of these multi family cmbs with proceeds from working capital and or available short term or longer term structured financings

current market conditions and commentary general 
the us economy showed modest signs of growth and improvements in labor markets in fiscal year  with real gross domestic product gdp expanding by in the fiscal year and the unemployment rate declining to 
however  data for the fourth quarter of suggest that economic activity paused during the quarter with gdp actually contracting by  due  in part  to weather related disruptions and other transitory factors 
meanwhile  the labor markets remain substantially unchanged  with the unemployment rate declining slightly to as of the end of february in a statement released on january   the federal reserve commented that while household spending and business fixed investment have advanced some recently and the housing sector has exhibited further signs of improvement  employment continues to only expand moderately with the unemployment rate remaining at an elevated level 
in the same announcement  the federal reserve also commented that it expects  with appropriate policy accommodation  economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and unemployment should gradually decline  though cautioning that strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook for the us recent data also suggest that inflation has been running somewhat below the federal reserve s longer run objective 
in its january  statement  the federal reserve stated that to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation  over time  is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate  the committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of billion per month and longer term us treasury securities at a pace of billion per month and that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction 
the policy to purchase us treasury securities at a pace of billion per month replaces operation twist  which terminated at the end of in the federal reserve s view  these policy actions should put downward pressure on longer term interest rates  support mortgage markets  and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative 
further  the federal reserve also announced a policy modification in december when it announced its determination to tie the end date of exceptionally low interest rates to specific macroeconomic targets 
in doing so  the federal reserve stated its intent to keep the target range for the federal funds rate below until either the unemployment rate drops below or the projected inflation rate over the next one to two years increases above and longer term inflation outlook changes 
upon satisfaction of either of these macroeconomic targets  the federal reserve intends to return to monetary policy goals of maximum employment and long term inflation of  which is consistent with the previously announced target end date of mid for a target federal funds rate below 
on january   the federal reserve affirmed its intent to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at these levels 
this environment coupled with the federal reserve s policy actions have fostered continued strong demand for agency rmbs backed by arms and fixed rate mortgages while also helping to keep the costs of financing and hedging at or near historical lows 
finally  continued difficulties in european financial markets and a contracting european economy served as a drag on the us and global economies in and  as noted above  continue to pose downside risks to the us economic outlook 
although volatility and uncertainty relating to the solvency of certain european financial institutions and sovereign governments stabilized during the second half of  we anticipate that economic news emanating from europe will continue to show signs of difficult conditions in the region  and as a result  may continue to create volatility and uncertainty in global financial and credit markets 
single family homes and residential mortgage market 
the residential real estate and mortgage market have shown signs of further improvement in data released by s p indices for its s p case shiller home price indices for november showed that  on average  home prices increased for its city composite and by for the city composite as compared to november in addition  data suggests that new and existing home sales in also improved as compared to  although the figures are still well below the peak numbers from prior to the financial crisis 
multi family housing 
apartments and other residential rental properties remain one of the better performing segments of the commercial real estate market 
as a result  pricing on new issuances of multi family cmbs has increased and is expected to continue to increase in the near future 
in  the gses have funded large numbers of new loans on multi family properties 
we believe this is due  in part  to low levels of new construction and increased demand from former homeowners  which has driven stronger rental income growth across the country 
in turn  these two factors have led to recent valuation recovery for multi family properties and negligible delinquencies on new multi family loans originated by freddie mac and fannie mae 
recent government actions 
in recent years  the us government and the federal reserve and other governmental regulatory bodies have taken numerous actions to stabilize or improve market and economic conditions in the us or to assist homeowners and may in the future take additional significant actions that may impact our portfolio and our business 
however  markets continue to remain uncertain over the us government s ability and will to address the country s budget deficits and other fiscal issues 
a description of recent government actions that we believe are most relevant to our operations and business is included below on october   the federal housing finance authority the fhfa released a white paper entitled building a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market 
the october white paper describes a proposed framework for both a new securitization platform and a model pooling and servicing agreement as set forth in an fhfa white paper issued in february the framework described in the october white paper sets forth three strategic goals for the next phase of the fannie mae and freddie mac conservatorships as follows i to build a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market  ii to gradually contract fannie mae and freddie mac presence in the marketplace while simplifying and shrinking their operations  and iii to maintain foreclosure prevention activities and credit availability for new and refinanced mortgages 
the october white paper  which was intended to establish an open exchange of ideas within the mortgage industry that will foster the further development of the above stated goals  is a proposed framework only 
as a result  it is currently unclear whether the proposals set forth in the october white paper will be enacted  or if enacted  what the effects of the enactment will be 
the policies and actions of the federal reserve as described above under general  including the implementation and expansion of operation twist and its successor policy 
pursuant to operation twist  the federal reserve sold more than billion of shorter term us treasury securities through the end of and used the proceeds to buy longer term us treasury securities 
operation twist and its successor program are intended to extend the average maturity of the securities in the federal reserve s portfolio 
by reducing the supply of longer term us treasury securities in the market  the action has created downward pressure on longer term interest rates  including rates on financial assets that investors consider to be close substitutes for longer term us treasury securities  like certain types of agency rmbs 
the reduction in longer term interest rates  in turn  may contribute to a broad easing in financial market conditions that the federal reserve hopes will provide additional stimulus to support economic recovery 
while longer term interest rates have fallen significantly since operation twist was first implemented  the federal reserve s ability to stimulate economic recovery through operation twist and its successor program remains uncertain 
on october   the fhfa  along with fannie mae and freddie mac  announced several changes to be made to harp 
among those changes to harp  which as modified  we refer to as harp ii  are the reduction or elimination in certain cases  of many risk based fees charged to borrowers when refinancing  the expansion of the previous loan to value ceiling to allow all underwater borrowers those borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than the value of their homes to participate in the program  regardless of the size of their loan versus the value of their home and the removal of certain representations and warranties made on behalf of lenders for loans owned or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac  among other changes 
the provisions of harp ii are only available to borrowers with loans originated prior to june  that are owned or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac 
aside from the expansion of harp as described above  borrowers attempting to utilize the provisions of harp ii are subject to the restrictions originally put in place for harp i 
harp ii  which is expected to run through the end of  presents the opportunity for many borrowers to take advantage of the ability to refinance their mortgages into lower interest rates  possibly resulting in higher prepayment speeds 
according to the fhfa  fannie mae and freddie mac refinanced more loans in the first seven months of under harp ii than all harp refinances in not surprisingly  prepayment spreads have generally trended higher during as compared to harp ii may negatively impact our agency rmbs  particularly the performance of our agency ios 
on august   the sec published a concept release no 
ic  file no 
sw  companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage related instruments pursuant to which it is reviewing whether certain companies that invest in mortgage backed securities and rely on the exemption from registration under section c c of the investment company act should continue to be allowed to rely on such exemption from registration 
this release suggests that the sec may modify the exemption relied upon by companies similar to us that invest in mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the comment period relating to the concept release concluded during the fourth quarter of the sec has yet to provide additional information on its position relating to this exception and timing of any future changes to the exemption remains unknown 
developments at fannie mae and freddie mac 
payments on the agency arms and fixed rate agency rmbs in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac 
as broadly publicized  fannie mae and freddie mac have experienced significant losses in recent years  and are presently under federal conservatorship as the us government continues to evaluate the futures of these entities and what role the us government should continue to play in the housing markets in the future 
while the exact scope and nature of the actions that the us government will ultimately undertake with respect to the future of fannie mae and freddie mac are unknown and will continue to evolve  it is probable that they each will continue to shrink in size 
new regulations and programs related to fannie mae and freddie mac may adversely affect the pricing  supply  liquidity and value of rmbs and otherwise materially harm our business and operations 
see recent government actions above 
credit spreads 
over the past few years  the credit markets generally experienced tightening credit spreads specifically  spreads between us treasury securities and other securities 
however  during the last six months of  the credit markets experienced significant spread widening due to a series of factors  including concerns related to a possible global economic slowdown  the european sovereign debt crisis and continued concern with respect to certain us domestic economic policies 
although credit spreads in the residential and commercial markets have generally tightened during  they continued to experience significant fluctuations due  in part  to continued concerns noted in the immediately preceding sentence 
typically when credit spreads widen  credit sensitive assets such as clos and multi family cmbs  as well as agency ios are negatively impacted  while tightening credit spreads typically have a positive impact on the value of such assets 
financing markets and liquidity 
the availability of repurchase agreement financing for our agency rmbs portfolio remains stable with interest rates between and for day repurchase agreements for agency arms and agency fixed rate rmbs 
the day london interbank offered rate libor was at december   marking a decrease of approximately basis point from september   and a decrease of basis points from the previous year end 
longer term interest rates also decreased during the year ended december   with the year us treasury rate decreasing by basis points to at december  we expect interest rates to rise over the longer term as the us and global economic outlook improves 
however  given the global economic headwinds and expected modest economic growth  we believe that interest rates  and thus our short term financing costs  are likely to remain at very low levels until such time as the economic data begin to confirm an acceleration of overall economic recovery 
these lower interest rates may contribute to higher prepayment experience for our portfolio while the conditions persist 
while the financing markets for agency rmbs remain favorable  financing and liquidity for commercial real estate securities and other credit sensitive assets have shown signs of improvement  as evidenced by the three longer terms structured financings we completed in prepayment rates 
as a result of various government initiatives  particularly harp ii  and relatively low intermediate and longer term treasury yields  rates on conforming mortgages during touched and have remained near historical lows and that same trend has continued during the first quarter of this has resulted in elevated prepayment rates during  as indicated in the table set forth under the caption results of operations prepayment experience 
significant estimates and critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap  which requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates are based  in part  on our judgment and assumptions regarding various economic conditions that we believe are reasonable based on facts and circumstances existing at the time of reporting 
the results of these estimates affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income  expenses and other comprehensive income during the periods presented 
changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on these financial statements 
accounting policies and estimates related to specific components of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sec guidance  those material accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and which require complex management judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
interest income on our investment securities and on our mortgage loans is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with investment securities and mortgage loans at the time of purchase or origination are amortized into interest income over the life of such securities using the effective yield method 
adjustments to premium amortization are made for actual prepayment activity 
interest income on our credit sensitive securities  such as our non agency rmbs and certain of our cmbs that were purchased at a discount to par value  is recognized based on the security s effective interest rate 
the effective interest rate on these securities is based on management s estimate from each security of the projected cash flows  which are estimated based on the company s assumptions related to fluctuations in interest rates  prepayment speeds and the timing and amount of credit losses 
on at least a quarterly basis  the company reviews and  if appropriate  makes adjustments to its cash flow projections based on input and analysis received from external sources  internal models  and its judgment about interest rates  prepayment rates  the timing and amount of credit losses  and other factors 
changes in cash flows from those originally projected  or from those estimated at the last evaluation  may result in a prospective change in the yield interest income recognized on these securities 
based on the projected cash flows from the company s first loss po cmbs purchased at a discount to par value  a portion of the purchase discount is designated as non accretable purchase discount or credit reserve  which partially mitigates the company s risk of loss on the mortgages collateralizing such cmbs  and is not expected to be accreted into interest income 
the amount designated as a credit reserve may be adjusted over time  based on the actual performance of the security  its underlying collateral  actual and projected cash flow from such collateral  economic conditions and other factors 
if the performance of a security with a credit reserve is more favorable than forecasted  a portion of the amount designated as credit reserve may be accreted into interest income over time 
conversely  if the performance of a security with a credit reserve is less favorable than forecasted  the amount designated as credit reserve may be increased  or impairment charges and write downs of such securities to a new cost basis could result 
with respect to interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedges  any net payments under  or fluctuations in the fair value of  such swaps will be recognized in current earnings 
fair value 
the company has established and documented processes for determining fair values 
fair value is based upon quoted market prices  where available 
if listed prices or quotes are not available  then fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use inputs that are market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves 
such inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
the company s ios pos  multi family loans held in securitization trusts and multi family cdos are considered to be the most significant of its fair value estimates 
the company s valuation methodologies are described in note fair value of financial instruments included in item of this annual report on form k 
mortgage loans held in securitization trusts impaired loans net 
impaired mortgage loans held in the securitization trusts are recorded at amortized cost less specific loan loss reserves 
impaired loan value is based on management s estimate of the net realizable value taking into consideration local market conditions of the distressed property  updated appraisal values of the property and estimated expenses required to remediate the impaired loan 
variable interest entities an entity is referred to as a variable interest entity vie if it meets at least one of the following criteria the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support of other parties  or as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk lack a the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns  or have disproportional voting rights and the entity s activities are conducted on behalf of the investor that has disproportionally few voting rights 
the company consolidates a vie when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and a right to receive benefits or absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the vie 
the company is required to reconsider its evaluation of whether to consolidate a vie each reporting period  based upon changes in the facts and circumstances pertaining to the vie

we determined that the consolidated k series were vies and that we are the primary beneficiary of the consolidated k series 
as a result  we are required to consolidate the consolidated k series underlying multi family loans including their liabilities  interest income and expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we have elected the fair value option on the assets and liabilities held within the consolidated k series  which requires that changes in valuations in the assets and liabilities of the consolidated k series will be reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
fair value option the fair value option provides an election that allows companies to irrevocably elect fair value for financial assets and liabilities on an instrument by instrument basis at initial recognition 
changes in fair value for assets and liabilities for which the election is made will be recognized in earnings as they occur

these securities are classified as subordinated debentures in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
derivative assets and liabilities 
we generally hedge the risks related to changes in interest rates related to our borrowings as well as market values of our overall portfolio 
in order to reduce our interest rate risk related to our borrowings  we may utilize various hedging instruments  such as interest rate swap agreement contracts whereby we receive floating rate payments in exchange for fixed rate payments  effectively converting our short term repurchase agreement borrowings or residential cdos to a fixed rate 
at december   the company had million of notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding with a fair market liability value of million 
the interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes 
in addition to utilizing interest rate swaps  we may purchase or sell short us treasury securities or enter into eurodollar or other futures contracts  options on futures and interest rate swaptions to help mitigate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the performance of our agency rmbs 
we may borrow securities to cover short sales of us treasury securities under reverse repurchase agreements 
realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with purchases and short sales of us treasury securities  eurodollar or other futures  options on futures and swaptions are recognized through earnings in our consolidated statements of operations 
the company uses to be announced securities  or tbas  to hedge market risk  as well as spread risk associated with its investments in agency ios 
in a tba transaction  we would agree to purchase or sell  for future delivery  agency rmbs with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of underlying collateral  but the particular agency rmbs to be delivered is not identified until shortly before the tba settlement date 
the company typically does not take delivery of tbas  but rather settles with its trading counterparties on a net basis 
tbas are liquid and have quoted market prices and represent the most actively traded class of rmbs 
for tba contracts that we have entered into  we have not asserted that physical settlement is probable 
because we have not designated these forward commitments associated with our agency ios as hedging instruments  realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these tbas are recognized through earnings in the consolidated statements of operations 
the use of tbas exposes the company to market value risk  as the market value of the securities that the company is required to purchase pursuant to a tba transaction may decline below the agreed upon purchase price 
conversely  the market value of the securities that the company is required to sell pursuant to a tba transaction may increase above the agreed upon sale price 
the use of tbas associated with our agency io investments creates significant short term payables and or receivables on our balance sheet 
derivative financial instruments may contain credit risk to the extent that the institutional counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with good credit ratings 
in addition  we regularly monitor the potential risk of loss with any one party resulting from this type of credit risk 
accordingly  we do not expect any material losses as a result of default by other parties  but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience counterparty failures in the future 
our investments in agency ios involve several types of derivative instruments used to hedge the overall risk profile of our investments in agency ios 
this hedging technique is dynamic in nature and requires frequent adjustments  which accordingly makes it very difficult to qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
hedge accounting treatment requires specific identification of a risk or group of risks and then requires that we designate a particular trade to that risk with no minimal ability to adjust over the life of the transaction 
because we and midway are frequently adjusting these derivative instruments in response to current market conditions  we have determined to account for all the derivative instruments related to our agency io investments as derivatives not designated as hedging instruments

results of operations comparison of the quarter ended december  to the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended december   the company reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  as compared to consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  for the same period in the increase is primarily due to an increase in net interest margin of million  an increase in realized gain on investment securities and related hedges of million  an increase in unrealized gain on multi family loans and debt held in securitization trusts of million  a decrease in general  administrative and other expense of million  and a decrease in impairment loss on investment securities of million  partially offset by an increase in unrealized loss on investment securities and related hedges of million  and a decrease in income from investments in limited partnership and limited liability company of million 
the increase in net interest margin of million is primarily due to an increase of million in average interest earning assets at december  as compared to december   which was mainly driven by the company s additional investments in agency rmbs and multi family cmbs during  achieved largely as a result of cash proceeds received from public stock offerings during the year ended december  the million increase in realized gain on investment securities and related hedges is primarily due to the performance of our agency io portfolio  which had a million realized gain for the quarter ended december  as compared to a million loss in the quarter ended december  the decrease in general  administrative and other expense of million is primarily due to the decrease in management contract termination fees of million  substantially all of which was recorded during the quarter ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  for the year ended december   we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of million  as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  the main components of the change in net income for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year are detailed in the following table dollar amounts in thousands  except per share data for the years ended december  change net interest income total other income expense total general  administrative and other expenses income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net income net income attributable to common stockholders basic income per common share diluted income per common share for the year ended december   the company reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  as compared to consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in net interest margin of million  an increase in unrealized gain on multi family loans and debt held in securitization trusts of million  a decrease in unrealized loss on investment securities and related hedges of million  a decrease in provision for loan loss of million  an increase in realized gain on investment securities and related hedges of million  partially offset by a decrease in income from investments in limited partnership and limited liability company of million  an increase in general  administrative and other expenses of million  and an increase in income tax expense of million 
the increase in net interest margin of million is primarily due to an increase of million in average interest earning assets resulting from the deployment of proceeds totaling million from four public equity offerings completed in the proceeds were mainly invested in agency rmbs and multi family cmbs during the million unrealized gain related to our multi family loans and debt held in securitization trusts was due to improving market conditions during the year ended december  there were no multi family loans and debt held in securitization trusts during the year ended december  the decline in net unrealized loss on investment securities and related hedges was mainly related to an improved environment for our investment portfolio  particularly our agency io portfolio  as compared to the comparative periods 
during the second half of  a confluence of factors  including uncertainty and concerns of systemic risk related to the european sovereign debt crisis and a revamping of the rules for harp ii  contributed to a significant widening of credit spreads and prepayment speed concerns  which in turn  negatively impacted the pricing of our agency ios at december  the general  administrative and other expenses increase of million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  is primarily due to an increase in management fees  driven in large part by the increase in assets managed by external managers and increased profitability of our investments

the increase in management fees for the year ended december  is primarily a result of an increase in assets managed by third parties and increased profitability of our investments 
the decrease in termination of management contract is due to the termination fees related to the termination of the advisory agreement between the company and hcs amounting to million  substantially all of which was recorded during the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  for the year ended december   we reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of million  as compared to million  for the year ended december  the decrease in full year earnings as compared to the same period in was driven by a net unrealized loss of million on investment securities and related hedges associated with the company s agency io strategy  partially offset by realized gains of million on the sale of clo notes during the main components of the change in net income for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year are detailed in the following table dollar amounts in thousands  except per share data for the years ended december  change net interest income total other expense income total general  administrative and other expenses income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net income net income attributable to common stockholders basic income per common share diluted income per common share for the year ended december   we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of million as compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net income was due primarily to a million increase in net unrealized loss on investment securities and related hedges  a one time termination fee of million recorded in connection with the termination of our advisory agreement with hcs  a million decrease in income from discontinued operations  a million increase in general  administrative and other expenses  a million increase in income tax expense  partially offset by a million increase in net interest margin on our investment portfolio and loans held in securitization trusts  a million increase in income from investments in limited partnership and limited liability company  a million decrease in provision for loan loss for the loans held in securitization trusts  and a million increase in net realized gain on securities and related hedges 
the increase in net interest income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a basis point increase in net interest income spread  which was mainly due to the performance of our agency ios and the maturity of all million of our series a preferred stock in which had an interest rate of

the net interest spread is impacted by factors such as our cost of financing  the interest rate that our investments bear and our interest rate hedging strategies 
furthermore  the amount of premium or discount paid on purchased portfolio investments and the prepayment rates on portfolio investments will impact the net interest spread as such factors will be amortized over the expected term of such investments

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  comply with margin requirements  fund our operations  pay management  incentive and consulting fees  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
our investments and assets  excluding the principal only multi family cmbs we invest in  generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through principal and interest payments  prepayments  net earnings retained prior to payment of dividends and distributions from unconsolidated investments  while the principal only multi family cmbs we invest in are backed by balloon non recourse mortgage loans that provide for the payment of principal at maturity date  which is typically seven to ten years 
in addition  depending on market conditions  the sale of investment securities  structured financings or capital market transactions may provide additional liquidity 
however  our intention is to meet our liquidity needs through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
during the year ended december   we were provided net cash of million  as a result of billion used in investing activities  which was offset by billion provided by financing activities and million of cash provided by operating activities 
our investing activities primarily included billion of purchases of investment securities  million of purchases of multi family cmbs held in securitization trusts  partially offset by million of proceeds from sales of investment securities and million in principal paydowns on investment securities available for sale 
our financing activities included proceeds from financing arrangements of million  stock issuances  net of expenses related to stock issuance of million  proceeds from securitized debt of million  partially offset by million in dividends paid 
we fund our investments and operations through a balanced and diverse funding mix  which includes proceeds from equity offerings  short term repurchase agreement borrowings  cdos  securitized debt  and trust preferred debentures 
the type and terms of financing used by us depends on the asset being financed 
in those cases where we utilize some form of structured financing  be it through cdos or securitized debt including financings similar to our cmbs master repurchase agreement  the cash flow produced by the assets that serve as collateral for these structured finance instruments may be restricted in terms of their use or applied to pay principal or interest on cdos  repurchase agreements  or notes that are senior to our interests 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents balances of million 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents from million at december  is due primarily to a significant increase in our average interest earning assets during the period and the need to hold greater cash and cash equivalent positions as a result of the additional investment securities and related hedges in our portfolio that are subject to margin calls 
based on our current investment portfolio  new investment initiatives  leverage ratio and available and future possible borrowing arrangements  we believe our existing cash balances  funds available under our current repurchase agreements and cash flows from operations will meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
we rely primarily on short term repurchase agreements typically days to finance the more liquid assets in our investment portfolio  such as agency rmbs and clos 
as of december   we have outstanding short term repurchase agreements  a form of collateralized short term borrowing  with eleven different financial institutions 
these agreements are secured by certain of our investment securities and bear interest rates that have historically moved in close relationship to libor 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements are based on the fair value of our investment securities portfolio 
interest rate changes and increased prepayment activity can have a negative impact on the valuation of these securities  reducing the amount we can borrow under these agreements 
moreover  our repurchase agreements allow the counterparties to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions and because these lines of financing are not committed  the counterparty can call the loan at any time 
if a counterparty determines that the value of the collateral has decreased  the counterparty may initiate a margin call and require us to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding borrowing in cash  on minimal notice 
moreover  in the event an existing counterparty elected to not renew the outstanding balance at its maturity into a new repurchase agreement  we would be required to repay the outstanding balance with cash or proceeds received from a new counterparty or to surrender the securities that serve as collateral for the outstanding balance  or any combination thereof 
if we are unable to secure financing from a new counterparty and had to surrender the collateral  we would expect to incur a loss 
in addition  in the event one of our lenders under the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation to re sell or return to us the securities that are securing the borrowings at the end of the term of the repurchase agreement  we would incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of haircut associated with the short term repurchase agreement  which we sometimes refer to as the amount at risk 
as of december   we had an aggregate amount at risk under our short term repurchase agreements with eleven counterparties of approximately million  with no greater than approximately million at risk with any single counterparty 
at december   the company had short term repurchase agreement borrowings of million as compared to million as of december  the increase in outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings is primarily due to an increase in the size of our leveraged agency rmbs portfolio  which has been funded with a portion of the proceeds from our recent public stock offerings 
in addition to our excess cash  the company has million in unencumbered securities  including million of rmbs  of which million are agency rmbs 
the million of cash  the million in rmbs  and million held in overnight deposits in our agency io portfolio included in restricted cash that is available to meet margin calls as it relates to our agency io portfolio repurchase agreements  which collectively represent of our financing arrangements  portfolio investments  are liquid and could be monetized to pay down or collateralize the liability immediately 
at december   we also had other longer term debt  including residential cdos outstanding of million  multi family cdos outstanding of billion which represent obligations of the consolidated k series  subordinated debt of million and securitized debt of million including the million of indebtedness issued pursuant to the cmbs master repurchase agreement 
the cdos are collateralized by the residential and multi family loans held in securitization trusts  respectively 
our maximum exposure to loss on our residential and multi family cdos at december  is million and million  respectively 
the securitized debt represents the notes issued from i our may multi family re securitization transaction  ii our november multi family cmbs collateralized recourse financing transaction  and iii our december distressed residential mortgage loan securitization transaction 
the multi family re securitization transaction was completed on may  for the purpose of financing certain multi family cmbs in our portfolio 
as part of the re securitization transaction  we contributed multi family cmbs having a carrying value at december  of approximately million to an spe of which we hold the class b note and the equity certificate 
the spe issued a class a note with a coupon of in the initial aggregate principal face amount of million 
the class a note was issued at a discount that provides for a bond equivalent yield of to the purchaser 
the class a note holder is entitled to receive all distributions of principal and interest from the multi family cmbs pledged to secure the note until the note is fully retired  which is expected to occur by january we will then receive all remaining cash flow  if any  through the class b note and our retained ownership in the spe 
we received net cash proceeds of million after deducting expenses associated with the transaction 
the class a note is not callable due to collateral valuation or performance and  due to the structure  we are not subject to margin call risk 
there is no guarantee that we will receive any cash flow the assets serving as collateral following the end of the ten year term 
we entered into the three year cmbs master repurchase agreement secured by multi family cmbs on november  to finance a portion of our multi family cmbs 
pursuant to this cmbs master repurchase agreement  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries transferred multi family cmbs having a carrying value of approximately million at december  to an spe of which we own the residual interest to serve as collateral in exchange for million of net proceeds to the company 
the proceeds of the transaction to us were generated from the spe s concurrent private placement of million of notes to a non financial institution pursuant to an indenture 
the notes bear interest that is payable monthly at a per annum rate equal to one month libor plus 
all income received on the multi family cmbs during the term of the cmbs master repurchase agreement are applied to pay any price differential and to reduce the aggregate repurchase price of the collateral under the cmbs master repurchase agreement 
in addition  the financing under the cmbs master repurchase agreement is subject to margin calls to the extent the market value of the multi family cmbs declines as determined by the indenture trustee  in which case the company would be required to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding financing in cash 
the indenture and the cmbs master repurchase agreement contain customary events of default 
in connection with the transaction  the company agreed to guarantee the due and punctual payment of our subsidiary s obligations under the cmbs master repurchase agreement 
we entered into the securitization transaction with a three year term on december  for the purpose of financing certain distressed residential mortgage loans acquired by us in the fourth quarter of pursuant to the terms of the securitization agreements for this transaction  one of our a wholly owned subsidiaries transferred distressed residential mortgage loans having a carrying value of approximately million at december  to an spe of which we own the equity certificate in exchange for million of proceeds after deducting expenses associated with the transaction 
the proceeds of the transaction to us were generated from the spe s concurrent private placement of million of notes to a non financial institution pursuant to an indenture 
the notes bear interest that is payable monthly at a per annum rate equal to and are scheduled to mature in december during the first two years of the financing  no principal payments will be made on the notes 
all cash proceeds generated by the mortgage loans during this two year period  after payment of interest on the notes and equity certificate  reserve amounts and certain other transaction expenses  will be available for the purchase by the spe of additional mortgage loans that satisfy certain eligibility criteria 
currently  the company targets our callable or short term financings leverage ratios at an to maximum leverage ratio for agency rmbs other than agency ios and a to maximum leverage ratio for agency ios 
at december   the company had a repurchase agreement outstanding backed by a clo security with an advance rate of approximately or a leverage ratio of less than to as of december   our overall leverage ratio  including both our short and longer term financing and excluding the cdo s issued by the consolidated k series and our residential cdos divided by common stockholders equity  was approximately to our leverage ratio on our short term financings or callable debt was approximately to we monitor all at risk or short term borrowings to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to satisfy margin calls and have the ability to respond to other market disruptions 
liquidity hedging and other factors certain of our hedging instruments may also impact our liquidity 
we use interest rate swaps  swaptions  eurodollar or other futures contracts to hedge interest rate risk associated with our investments in agency rmbs 
with respect to interest rate swaps  futures contracts and tbas  initial margin deposits will be made upon entering into these contracts and can be either cash or securities 
during the period these contracts are open  changes in the value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or losses by marking to market on a daily basis to reflect the market value of these contracts at the end of each day s trading 
we may be required to satisfy variable margin payments periodically  depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred 
we also use tbas to hedge interest rate risk associated with our investments in agency ios 
since delivery for these securities extends beyond the typical settlement dates for most non derivative investments  these transactions are more prone to market fluctuations between the trade date and the ultimate settlement date  and thereby are more vulnerable to increasing amounts at risk with the applicable counterparties 
the use of tbas associated with our agency io investments creates significant short term payables and or receivables  amounting to million at december   and is included in payable for securities purchased on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also use us treasury securities and us treasury futures and options to hedge interest rate risk associated with our investments in agency ios and interest rate swap agreements and swaptions as a mechanism to reduce the interest rate risk of our agency arms and mortgage loans held in securitization trusts 
liquidity equity offerings in addition to the financing arrangements described above under the caption liquidity financing arrangements  we also rely on secondary equity offerings as a source of both short term and long term liquidity 
during the year ended december   we closed on the following public offerings of common stock on may   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of up to  shares of our common stock including  shares issuable pursuant to an over allotment option at a public offering price of per share 
on may   we closed on the issuance of  shares to the underwriter  resulting in total net proceeds to us of million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
on july   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of up to  shares of our common stock including  shares that were issuable pursuant to an over allotment option at a public offering price of per share 
on july   we closed on the issuance of  shares of common stock to the underwriter including the  over allotment option shares  resulting in total net proceeds of million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
on august   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of up to  shares of our common stock including  shares that were issuable pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares at a public offering price of per share 
on august   we closed on the issuance of  shares of common stock to the underwriter  resulting in total net proceeds of million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
on september   we closed on the issuance of  additional shares pursuant to the option granted to the underwriters  resulting in additional net proceeds of million 
on october   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of up to  shares of our common stock including the  shares that were issuable pursuant to an over allotment option at a public offering price of per share 
on october   we closed on the issuance of  shares of common stock to the underwriter including the  shares issuable pursuant to the over allotment option  resulting in total net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we used substantially all of the net proceeds from these offerings to fund additional investments in our targeted assets  including agency rmbs  multi family cmbs and distressed residential mortgage loans 
we also may generate liquidity through the sale of shares of our common stock in an at the market offering program pursuant to an equity distribution agreement  as well as through the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan  or drip 
on june   we entered into an equity distribution agreement with jmp securities llc as the placement agent  pursuant to which we may sell up to  of shares of our common stock from time to time through the placement agent 
pursuant to the equity distribution agreement  the shares may be offered and sold through the placement agent in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in rule under the securities act of  as amended  including sales made directly on the nasdaq capital market or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange or  subject to the terms of a written notice from us  in privately negotiated transactions 
we have no obligation to sell any of the shares under the equity distribution agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the equity distribution agreement 
on january   we filed a registration statement on form s to enable us to issue up to  of shares of our common stock pursuant to our drip 
as of december   we had yet to issue any shares under the equity distribution agreement or the drip 
management agreements we have investment management agreements with riverbanc  midway and headlands  pursuant to which we pay these managers a base management and incentive fee quarterly in arrears 
see results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to year ended december  comparative expenses for more information regarding the management fees paid during the year ended december  in addition  pursuant to the terms of our former advisory relationship with hcs  we also may pay incentive compensation to hcs with respect to those assets of our company that were managed by hcs at the time the advisory relationship with hcs concluded the incentive tail assets until such time as such incentive tail assets are disposed of by us or mature 
dividends on december   we declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of per common share  which is the same amount that was declared for the third quarter 
the dividend was paid on january  to common stockholders of record as of december  the dividend was paid out of our working capital 
for additional information regarding the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock  see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities above 
we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock during the near term 
however  our board of directors will continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter and will make adjustments as necessary  based on a variety of factors  including  among other things  the need to maintain our reit status  our financial condition  liquidity  earnings projections and business prospects 
our dividend policy does not constitute an obligation to pay dividends 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the various requirements to maintain our reit status and to minimize or avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
however  differences in timing between the recognition of reit taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements and to minimize or avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
exposure to european financial counterparties we finance the acquisition of a significant portion of our mortgage backed securities with repurchase agreements 
in connection with these financing arrangements  we pledge our securities as collateral to secure the borrowings 
the amount of collateral pledged will typically exceed the amount of the financing with the extent of over collateralization ranging from of the amount borrowed in the case of agency arm and agency fixed rate rmbs collateral to up to in the case of clo collateral 
while our repurchase agreement financing results in us recording a liability to the counterparty in our consolidated balance sheet  we are exposed to the counterparty  if during the term of the repurchase agreement financing  a lender should default on its obligation and we are not able to recover our pledged assets 
the amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral 
several large european banks have experienced financial difficulty in recent years  some of whom have required a rescue or assistance from other large european banks or the european central bank 
some of these banks have us banking subsidiaries which have provided repurchase agreement financing or interest rate swap agreements to us in connection with the acquisition of various investments  including mortgage backed securities investments 
we have outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings with credit suisse first boston llc in the amount of million at december  with a net exposure of million 
we have outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings with deutsche bank securities inc in the amount of million at december  with a net exposure of million 
we have outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings with barclays capital inc in the amount of million at december  with a net exposure of million 
we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements with barclays bank plc as a counterparty in the amount of million notional with a net exposure of million 
we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements with credit suisse international as a counterparty in the amount of million notional with a net exposure of million 
in addition  certain of our us based counterparties may have significant exposure to the financial and economic turmoil in europe which could impact their future lending activities or cause them to default under agreements with us 
in the event one or more of these counterparties or their affiliates experience liquidity difficulties in the future  our liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
inflation for the periods presented herein  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
the impact of inflation is primarily reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
virtually all our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
our consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates typically increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
during periods of increasing interest rates  demand for mortgages and a borrower s ability to qualify for mortgage financing in a purchase transaction may be adversely affected 
during periods of decreasing interest rates  borrowers may prepay their mortgages  which in turn may adversely affect our yield and subsequently the value of our portfolio of mortgage assets 
contractual obligations and commitments the company had the following contractual obligations at december  dollar amounts in thousands total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases repurchase agreements subordinated debentures securitized debt management fees employment agreements interest rate swaps total contractual obligations amount reflects nine months of free rent on a ten year lease agreement entered into by us on december  to relocate our corporate office 
amounts include projected interest payments during the period 
interest based on interest rates in effect on december  amounts include the base fees for midway  riverbanc and headlands based on the current invested capital 
the management fees exclude incentive fees which are based on future performance 
we exclude our residential cdos from the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above as this debt is non recourse and not cross collateralized and  therefore  must be satisfied exclusively from the proceeds of the residential mortgage loans and real estate owned held in the securitization trusts 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our residential cdos 
we also exclude the securitized debt related to our may re securitization transaction as this debt is non recourse to the company 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our securitized debt 
the company s multi family cdos  which represent the cdos issued by the consolidated k series is excluded as this debt is non recourse to the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
all of our market risk sensitive assets  liabilities and related derivative positions are for non trading purposes only 
management recognizes the following primary risks associated with our business and the industry in which we conduct business interest rate risk liquidity risk prepayment risk credit risk fair value risk the following analysis includes forward looking statements that assume that certain market conditions occur 
actual results may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in our portfolio assets and borrowings mix and due to developments in the domestic and global financial and real estate markets 
developments in the financial markets include the likelihood of changing interest rates and the relationship of various interest rates and their impact on our portfolio yield  cost of funds and cash flows 
the analytical methods that we use to assess and mitigate these market risks should not be considered projections of future events or operating performance 
interest rate risk interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary  tax policies  domestic and international economic conditions  and political or regulatory matters beyond our control 
changes in interest rates affect the value of the financial assets we manage and hold in our investment portfolio and the variable rate borrowings we use to finance our portfolio 
changes in interest rates also affect the interest rate swaps and caps  eurodollar and other futures  tbas and other securities or instruments we use to hedge our portfolio 
as a result  our net interest income is particularly affected by changes in interest rates 
for example  we hold rmbs  some of which may have fixed rates or interest rates that adjust on various dates that are not synchronized to the adjustment dates on our repurchase agreements 
in general  the re pricing of our repurchase agreements occurs more quickly than the re pricing of our variable interest assets 
thus  it is likely that our floating rate borrowings  such as our repurchase agreements  may react to interest rates before our rmbs because the weighted average next re pricing dates on the related borrowings may have shorter time periods than that of the rmbs 
in addition  the interest rates on our agency arms backed by hybrid arms may be limited to a periodic cap  or an increase of typically or per adjustment period  while our borrowings do not have comparable limitations 
moreover  changes in interest rates can directly impact prepayment speeds  thereby affecting our net return on rmbs 
during a declining interest rate environment  the prepayment of rmbs may accelerate as borrowers may opt to refinance at a lower interest rate causing the amount of liabilities that have been extended by the use of interest rate swaps to increase relative to the amount of rmbs  possibly resulting in a decline in our net return on rmbs  as replacement rmbs may have a lower yield than those being prepaid 
conversely  during an increasing interest rate environment  rmbs may prepay more slowly than expected  requiring us to finance a higher amount of rmbs than originally forecast and at a time when interest rates may be higher  resulting in a decline in our net return on rmbs 
accordingly  each of these scenarios can negatively impact our net interest income 
we seek to manage interest rate risk in our portfolio by utilizing interest rate swaps  swaptions  caps  eurodollar and other futures  options and us treasury securities with the goal of optimizing the earnings potential while seeking to maintain long term stable portfolio values 
we continually monitor the duration of our mortgage assets and have a policy to hedge the financing of those assets such that the net duration of the assets  our borrowed funds related to such assets  and related hedging instruments  is less than one year 
in addition  we utilize tbas to mitigate the risks on our long agency rmbs positions associated with our investments in agency ios 
we utilize a model based risk analysis system to assist in projecting portfolio performances over a scenario of different interest rates 
the model incorporates shifts in interest rates  changes in prepayments and other factors impacting the valuations of our financial securities and instruments  including mortgage backed securities  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  tbas and eurodollar futures 
based on the results of the model  the instantaneous changes in interest rates specified below would have had the following effect on net interest income for the next months based on our assets and liabilities as of december  dollar amounts in thousands changes in net interest income changes in interest rates changes in net interest income interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our financial assets and related hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our mortgage assets  other than ios  decreases  and conversely  as interest rates decrease  the value of such investments will increase 
the value of an io will likely be negatively affected in a declining interest rate environment due to the risk of increasing prepayment rates because the ios value is wholly contingent on the underlying mortgage loans having an outstanding balance 
in general  we expect that  over time  decreases in the value of our portfolio attributable to interest rate changes will be offset  to the degree we are hedged  by increases in the value of our interest rate swaps or other financial instruments used for hedging purposes  and vice versa 
however  the relationship between spreads on securities and spreads on our hedging instruments may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decline 
that said  unless there is a material impairment in value that would result in a payment not being received on a security or loan  changes in the book value of our portfolio will not directly affect our recurring earnings or our ability to make a distribution to our stockholders 
liquidity risk liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we recognize the need to have funds available to operate our business 
it is our policy to have adequate liquidity at all times 
we plan to meet liquidity through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
our principal sources of liquidity are the repurchase agreements on our mortgage backed securities  the cdos we have issued to finance our loans held in securitization trusts  securitized debt  trust preferred securities  the principal and interest payments from our assets and cash proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities as market and other conditions permit 
we are subject to margin call risk under the terms of our repurchase agreements 
we believe our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
as it relates to our investment portfolio  derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk subject us to margin call risk 
if the value of our pledged assets decreases due to a change in interest rates  credit characteristics  or other pricing factors  we may be required to post additional cash or asset collateral  or reduce the amount we are able to borrow against the collateral 
for example  under our interest rate swaps  typically we pay a fixed rate to the counterparties while they pay us a floating rate 
if interest rates drop below the fixed rate we are paying on an interest rate swap  we may be required to post cash margin 
prepayment risk when borrowers repay the principal on their residential mortgage loans before maturity or faster than their scheduled amortization  the effect is to shorten the period over which interest is earned  and therefore  reduce the yield for residential mortgage assets purchased at a premium to their then current balance  as with the majority of our assets 
conversely  residential mortgage assets purchased for less than their then current balance  such as the distressed residential mortgage loans purchased by us in december  exhibit higher yields due to faster prepayments 
furthermore  prepayment speeds exceeding or lower than our modeled prepayment speeds impact the effectiveness of any hedges we have in place to mitigate financing and or fair value risk 
generally  when market interest rates decline  borrowers have a tendency to refinance their mortgages  thereby increasing prepayments 
the impact of increasing prepayment rates  whether as a result of declining interest rates  government intervention in the mortgage markets or otherwise  is particularly acute with respect to our agency ios 
because the value of an io security is wholly contingent on the underlying mortgage loans having an outstanding principal balance  an unexpected increase in prepayment rates on the pool of mortgage loans underlying the ios could significantly negatively impact the performance of our agency ios 
our modeled prepayments will help determine the amount of hedging we use to off set changes in interest rates 
if actual prepayment rates are higher than modeled  the yield will be less than modeled in cases where we paid a premium for the particular residential mortgage asset 
conversely  when we have paid a premium  if actual prepayment rates experienced are slower than modeled  we would amortize the premium over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
in an environment of increasing prepayment speeds  the timing difference between the actual cash receipt of principal paydowns and the announcement of the principal paydown may result in additional margin requirements from our repurchase agreement counterparties 
we mitigate prepayment risk by constantly evaluating our residential mortgage assets relative to prepayment speeds observed for assets with a similar structure  quality and characteristics 
furthermore  we stress test the portfolio as to prepayment speeds and interest rate risk in order to further develop or make modifications to our hedge balances 
historically  we have not hedged of our liability costs due to prepayment risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk that we will not fully collect the principal we have invested in mortgage loans  including distressed residential loans or other assets  such as non agency rmbs  cmbs  and clos  due to borrower defaults 
our portfolio of residential mortgage loans held in securitization trusts as of december  consisted of approximately million of securitized first liens originated in and earlier 
the securitized first liens were principally originated in by one of our subsidiaries prior to our exit from the mortgage lending business 
these are predominately high quality loans with an average loan to value ltv ratio at origination of approximately  and average borrower fico score of approximately in addition  approximately of these loans were originated with full income and asset verification 
while we feel that the quality of our origination and underwriting of these loans will help to mitigate the risk of significant borrower default on these loans  we cannot assure you that all borrowers will continue to satisfy their payment obligations under these loans and thereby avoid default 
in our distressed residential loans portfolio  the mortgage loans are purchased at discounts reflecting their distressed state or perceived higher risk of default  which may include higher ltv s and  in certain instances  delinquent loan payments 
prior to the acquisition of loans  our external investment manager validates key information provided by the sellers that is necessary to determine the value of the residential loan 
we then seek to maximize the value of the mortgage loans that we acquire either through borrower assisted refinancing  outright loan sale or through foreclosure and resale of the underlying home 
as of december   the company owns million of first loss cmbs comprised of pos that are backed by commercial mortgage loans on multi family properties at a weighted average amortized purchase price of approximately of current par 
the overall return of these securities will be dependent on the performance of the underlying loans and accordingly  management has taken an appropriate credit reserve when determining the amount of discount to accrete into income over time 
in addition  we owned approximately million of non agency rmbs senior securities 
the non agency rmbs has a weighted average amortized purchase price of approximately of current par value 
management believes the purchase price discount coupled with the credit support within the bond structure protects us from principal loss under most stress scenarios for these non agency rmbs 
as of december   we own approximately million of notes issued by a clo at a discounted purchase price equal to of par 
the securities are backed by a portfolio of middle market corporate loans 
we also own approximately million of mezzanine financing at december  backed by residential and multi family properties 
fair value risk changes in interest rates also expose us to market value fair value fluctuation on our assets  liabilities and hedges 
while the fair value of the majority of our assets when excluding all consolidated k series assets other than the securities we actually own that are measured on a recurring basis are determined using level fair values  we own certain assets  such as our cmbs  for which fair values may not be readily available if there are no active trading markets for the instruments 
in such cases  fair values would only be derived or estimated for these investments using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently subjective and imprecise 
minor changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these derived or estimated fair values 
our fair value estimates and assumptions are indicative of the interest rate environments as of december   and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations 
we note that the values of our investments in derivative instruments  primarily interest rate hedges on our debt  will be sensitive to changes in market interest rates  interest rate spreads  credit spreads and other market factors 
the value of these investments can vary and has varied materially from period to period 
the following describes the methods and assumptions we use in estimating fair values of our financial instruments fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques 
these techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments  discount rates  estimate of future cash flows  future expected loss experience and other factors 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values 
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument 
also  because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values  the fair values used by us should not be compared to those of other companies 
the table below presents the sensitivity of the market value and net duration changes of our portfolio as of december   using a discounted cash flow simulation model assuming an instantaneous interest rate shift 
application of this method results in an estimation of the fair market value change of our assets  liabilities and hedging instruments per basis point bp shift in interest rates 
the use of hedging instruments is a critical part of our interest rate risk management strategies  and the effects of these hedging instruments on the market value of the portfolio are reflected in the model output 
this analysis also takes into consideration the value of options embedded in our mortgage assets including constraints on the re pricing of the interest rate of assets resulting from periodic and lifetime cap features  as well as prepayment options 
assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive such as cash  payment receivables  prepaid expenses  payables and accrued expenses are excluded 
changes in assumptions including  but not limited to  volatility  mortgage and financing spreads  prepayment behavior  defaults  as well as the timing and level of interest rate changes will affect the results of the model 
therefore  actual results are likely to vary from modeled results 
market value changes changes in interest rates changes in market value net duration amounts in thousands years years base years years it should be noted that the model is used as a tool to identify potential risk in a changing interest rate environment but does not include any changes in portfolio composition  financing strategies  market spreads or changes in overall market liquidity 
although market value sensitivity analysis is widely accepted in identifying interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration changes that may occur such as  but not limited to  changes in investment and financing strategies  changes in market spreads and changes in business volumes 
accordingly  we make extensive use of an earnings simulation model to further analyze our level of interest rate risk 
there are a number of key assumptions in our earnings simulation model 
these key assumptions include changes in market conditions that affect interest rates  the pricing of earning assets  the availability of investment assets and the availability and the cost of financing for portfolio assets 
other key assumptions made in using the simulation model include prepayment speeds and management investment  financing and hedging strategies  and the issuance of new equity 
we typically run the simulation model under a variety of hypothetical scenarios that may include different interest rate scenarios  and different prepayment possibilities  in order to assess potential interest rate risk 
the assumptions used represent our estimate of the likely effect of changes in interest rates and do not necessarily reflect actual results 
the earnings simulation model takes into account periodic and lifetime caps embedded in our assets in determining the earnings at risk
