executive summary beginning in  we renewed our focus on our primary  traditional markets  which are north american class through trucks and buses  and began an initiative to realign the company around a more functionally oriented structure in order to reduce overhead expenses and other costs 
we implemented a return on invested capital roic methodology combined with an assessment of the strategic fit with our core business  to identify areas that are under performing or are non strategic 
we are working to fix  divest or close under performing and non strategic areas and expect to realize incremental benefits from these actions in the near future 
in addition  we are restructuring our business and rationalizing our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure 
this effort is ongoing  and may lead to additional divestitures of businesses or discontinuing engineering programs that are outside of our core operations or not performing to our expectations 
during  we continued our ongoing efforts of realigning our management structure around the functional expertise needed to execute our core north american strategy 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed certain changes to our organizational and reporting structures 
we believe this realignment will result in better execution of our strategies  streamline the decision making process  create better alignment towards a common objective  and reduce our operating costs 
during the past couple of years  we experienced significant strategic and operational challenges  but have taken actions that we believe will improve our future performance 
we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value 
we announced changes to our engine strategy  signed supply agreements with cummins  and reinforced our cash position during this transition period 
we are making steady progress in our six guiding principles of customer satisfaction  great products  quality  reduced cost  people  and urgency 
following our six guiding principles  the entire organization remains aligned around our drive to deliver turnaround plan  which set the stage for our accomplishments and our expectations going forward 
our accomplishments following our drive to deliver plan  we made substantial progress during on our top priorities i 
improve quality we moved with urgency to address quality issues in our existing product portfolio  as well as implemented new quality controls and testing systems 
for example  during  we logged nearly four million test miles on the international prostar trucks powered by our certified maxxforce l engine defined below 
ii 
hit our launches we achieved several milestones  which included achieving epa certification using an existing scr technology  getting to market products that incorporate existing scr technology while expanding our engine options  and revamping our heavy duty truck portfolio 
specific examples include we met our first major engine strategy milestone with the launch of certain class truck models featuring the cummins isx engine  which includes their after treatment system  in december in april  we met another major engine strategy milestone with the receipt of epa certification of our maxxforce l big bore engines incorporating the cummins scr after treatment system the certified maxxforce l engine 
later in that same month  we began shipping our international prostar trucks powered by our certified maxxforce l engine 
also in april  we received on board diagnostics obd certification for all current applications 
iii 
deliver on our plan we demonstrated discipline with regards to the cash of our manufacturing operations  where we met our guidance each quarter of we made tough decisions to reduce operating costs and made significant progress on our benchmarking study and roic evaluation initiative 
we changed our leadership  which resulted in blending our internal expertise with an outside perspective 
in  we implemented a number of cost reduction actions to control spending across the company  including reductions in discretionary spending and employee headcount reductions 
as a result  our operating costs  which include selling  general and administrative sg a expenses and engineering and product development costs  decreased by million in  compared to the prior year 
also throughout  we initiated various additional cost reduction actions that were identified by our benchmarking study 
specifically in september  we leveraged efficiencies identified through redesigning our organizational structure and began implementing new cost reduction 
table of contents initiatives  including an enterprise wide reduction in force  which we expect will contribute an estimated million to million of annual savings beginning in the roic evaluation initiative drove our decisions to divest i our interests in mahindra navistar automotives ltd 
and mahindra navistar engines private ltd 
collectively  the mahindra joint ventures in february  ii the workhorse custom chassis wcc business in march  iii substantially all of our interest in certain operations of the monaco rv business in may  and iv the bison coach trailer manufacturing business bison coach in october 
we also entered into an agreement to sublease a portion of our manufacturing facility in cherokee  alabama 
additionally  we began rationalizing certain engineering and product development programs due in part to changes in our engine strategy and renewed focus on our core business of the north american truck and bus markets 
in connection with our renewed focus on the north america market  we have realigned our leadership and management structure around functional expertise 
we believe this realignment will result in better execution of our strategies by facilitating faster decision making  driving greater accountability and transparency  creating better alignment towards common objectives  and reducing our operating costs 
as a result of the progress we have made with this realignment  we determined our reporting segments changed in the fourth quarter of iv 
build sales momentum in our traditional markets  we have seen a strong response to our new truck offerings 
as of october   our backlog of unfilled truck orders in our traditional markets increased by compared to october  we have seen an increase in our order share in the second half of compared to the first half of the year 
we believe this momentum will continue to be fueled by offering the cummins isb liter engine the cummins isb in our international durastar medium duty trucks and ic bus ce series school buses 
initial production of durastar and ce series school buses  incorporating the cummins isb  is expected to begin during our first quarter of our expectations going forward we believe we are well positioned to build upon our accomplishments and take them to the next level i 
lead in vehicle uptime quality remains at the forefront of our customer focused approach 
we believe our quality will continue to improve and our trucks will be market leaders in uptime and fuel economy with the lowest cost of ownership 
going forward  we believe we are building the best trucks in our company history 
ii 
lean enterprise we are utilizing a customer focused redesign of our trucks to find new ways to reduce costs and add value for our customers 
we are eliminating waste and driving functional excellence to achieve continuous improvement 
we expect these steps will build customer satisfaction  lower our break even point  and drive profitability at all points in the cycle 
iii 
financial growth we expect the increases seen in our orders and backlogs in our traditional markets will translate to increased volumes and market share in the future 
due to our focus on reducing costs through manufacturing optimization  eliminating waste  and addressing the opportunities identified by benchmarking studies  we expect to lower manufacturing costs  increase capacity utilization and productivity  and achieve a lower cost structure 
we also expect to continue to enhance our liquidity and profitability 
as a result of these actions  we expect to improve our financial performance and achieve our long term financial goals 
iv 
profitable improvements in market share we expect the sales momentum that began in late to continue with new and improved products  volume growth  and effective pricing 
we intend to move steadily closer towards having a full product portfolio with the scr after treatment technology 
we expect to continue our product differentiation with enhanced features and options that will benefit our customers and help drive profitable market share improvements 
financial summary continuing operating results in  we continued to experience significant under performance in our operating results 
our consolidated net sales and revenues were billion in  which is a decrease of compared to this decrease reflects lower net sales in our north america truck segment and our global operations segment 
the north america truck segment sales decrease was primarily due to decreased volumes in our traditional market  reflecting reduced sales volumes as we transition our engine strategy  and lower military sales 
the global operations segment net sales decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of truck sales 
in  we incurred a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million  compared to a loss of billion in the improvements in our comparative results were primarily driven by lower sg a expenses  engineering and product development costs  and restructuring charges 
these decreases were partially offset by the impacts of the declines in 
table of contents our consolidated net sales and revenues and higher asset impairment charges 
during this period of lower sales volumes  we have successfully reduced our sg a expenses by and our engineering and product development costs by 
the sg a expense reduction reflects the realization of savings from our cost reduction initiatives  while the reduction in engineering and product development costs reflects savings from project rationalization of certain engineering programs and other efforts 
in the fourth quarter of  our north america truck segment recorded a non cash charge of million to reflect the impairment of goodwill in our north america truck reporting unit 
in  we recorded a gain of million related to the february sale of the company interests in the mahindra joint ventures 
in  the company incurred equity losses related to the mahindra joint ventures of million 
additionally in  we recorded a gain of million from a legal settlement 
offsetting these factors was an increase in interest expense of million in which is primarily due to the increase in our outstanding debt 
in  we recognized an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million  compared to expense of billion in in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an income tax benefit of million as a result of meeting the criteria necessary to apply the exception within the intraperiod tax allocation rules 
in  we recognized income tax expense of billion for the increase in our deferred tax valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets  partially offset by income tax benefit of million  which resulted from the release of a significant portion of our income tax valuation allowance on our canadian deferred tax assets 
in after income taxes  the company incurred a loss from continuing operations attributable to navistar international corporation of million  or per diluted share  compared to a loss of billion  or per diluted share  for in  the weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate the per share amounts increased by million  primarily due to the october issuance of our common stock in a public offering 
liquidity we ended the fourth quarter of with billion of consolidated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to billion as of october  in october  we completed the private sale of million of senior subordinated convertible notes due october convertible notes 
also in october  our financial services operations made an intercompany loan of million to our manufacturing operations  utilizing existing credit facilities 
the company expects to use the proceeds from the convertible notes for general corporate purposes  which  together with the intercompany loan  may include the repayment of the million of senior subordinated convertible notes due october convertible notes 
during the second quarter of  we amended our term loan credit facility whereby we lowered our interest rate and modified the maturity date to august  we also utilized proceeds from the issuance of million of additional senior notes  due the senior notes to make a principal repayment of million against our term loan credit facility 
business outlook and key trends we continually look for ways to improve the efficiency and performance of our operations 
our focus is on improving our core north america truck and parts businesses 
we are also continuing to evaluate opportunities to restructure our businesses and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure which could include  among other actions  additional rationalization of our manufacturing operations and or divesting of non core businesses 
these actions could result in additional restructuring and other related charges  including but not limited to  impairments  employee termination costs  and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments  that could be significant 
certain trends have affected our results of operations for as compared to and in addition  we expect that the following key trends will impact our future results of operations segment realignment in connection with our renewed focus on our primary markets  we have realigned our management and reporting structure around functional expertise 
we believe this realignment will result in better execution of our strategies by facilitating faster decision making  driving greater accountability and transparency  creating better alignment towards common objectives and reducing our operating costs 
with the completion of changes in the fourth quarter of  our reporting segments changed to the following segments  which reflect how our new chief operating decision maker codm assesses the performance of our operating segments and makes decisions about resource allocations north america truck this segment manufactures and distributes class through trucks  buses  and military vehicles under the international and ic brands  along with production of engines under the maxxforce brand name  in the north america markets that include sales in the us  canada  and mexico 
in an effort to strengthen and maintain our dealer network  this segment occasionally acquires and operates dealer locations for the purpose of transitioning ownership 

table of contents north america parts this segment provides customers with proprietary products needed to support the international commercial and military truck  ic bus  maxxforce engine lines  as well as our other product lines 
our north america parts segment also provides a wide selection of other standard truck  trailer  and engine aftermarket parts 
at october   this segment operated eleven regional parts distribution centers that provide hour availability and shipment 
also included in the north america parts segment are the operating results of bdp  which manages the sourcing  merchandising  and distribution of certain service parts we sell to ford in north america 
global operations this segment includes businesses that derive their revenue from outside our core north america markets and primarily consists of the iiaa formerly mwm engine and truck operations in brazil and our export truck and parts businesses 
the iiaa engine operations produce diesel engines  primarily under contract manufacturing arrangements  as well as under the mwm brand  for sale to oems in south america 
financial services this segment provides retail  wholesale  and lease financing of products sold by the north america truck and north america parts segments and their dealers within the us and mexico  as well as financing for wholesale accounts and selected retail accounts receivable 
engine strategy and emissions standards compliance we believe that our new strategy of integrating our engines with the cummins scr after treatment solution  coupled with offering the cummins isb and isx engines  positions the company for future success 
we expect this strategy will help to address uncertainty around the continuation of product offerings  which had a detrimental impact on the company performance  including a deterioration of market share 
the company has incurred significant research and development and tooling costs to design and produce our product lines to meet the epa and carb on highway heavy duty diesel hdd emissions standards  including obd requirements 
these emissions standards have and will continue to result in significant increases in costs of our products 
traditional truck market the traditional truck markets in which we compete are typically cyclical in nature and are strongly influenced by macro economic factors such as industrial production  demand for durable goods  capital spending  oil prices and consumer confidence 
we anticipate the traditional truck industry retail deliveries will be in the range of  units to  units for we expect benefits from further improvements in our traditional volumes as the truck industry continues to recover from the historic lows experienced in the recent past 
according to act research  the average age of truck fleets still remains high 
we anticipate higher sales in  resulting from truck replacement as our customers refresh aging fleets 
we also expect demand for trucks to increase as freight volumes and rates continue to improve as the us economy recovers 
worldwide engine unit sales our worldwide engine unit sales were  units in   units in  and  units in our and worldwide engine unit sales were primarily to external customers in south america and our north america truck segment 
principally in our south america operations  we also made certain other oem sales for the contract manufacturing of engines for commercial  consumer  and specialty vehicle products 
we expect our south american operations to continue to be a key contributor to the global operations segment and expect improvements from our oem sales for commercial  consumer  and specialty vehicle products 
in north america during  we integrated the cummins urea based after treatment systems with our maxxforce engines 
also in may  our engine joint venture with jac was fully capitalized and became operational 
we continued to make investments in engineering and product development for our proprietary engines for product innovations  cost reductions  and fuel economy 
our markets are impacted by consumer demand for products that use our engines  as well as macro economic factors such as oil prices and construction activity 
military sales our us military sales were million in  compared to billion in and billion in the and military sales primarily consisted of upgrading mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles with our rolling chassis solution and retrofit kits 
in comparison  our sales consisted of delivering  servicing  and maintaining mrap vehicles  lower cost militarized commercial trucks  and sales of parts and services 
in  we expect our us military sales to continue to decline 
contributing to the decline are the budgetary constraints experienced by the us government 
warranty costs emissions regulations in the us and canada have resulted in rapid product development cycles  driving significant changes from previous engine models 
in  we introduced changes to our engine line up in response to emissions regulations 
component complexity and other related costs associated with meeting emissions standards have contributed to higher repair costs that exceeded those that we have historically experienced 
historically  warranty claims experience for launch year engines has been higher compared to the prior model year engines  however  over time we have been able to refine both the design and manufacturing process to reduce both the volume and the severity of warranty claims 
while we continue to improve the design and manufacturing of our engines to reduce the volume and severity of warranty claims  we have continued to experience higher warranty costs than expected which has contributed to significantly higher warranty charges for current and pre existing warranties  including charges for extended service contracts  in we recognized adjustments to pre existing warranties of million in both and  compared 
table of contents to adjustments of million in these adjustments to pre existing warranties relate to the unanticipated increase in warranty expense  primarily for certain emission standard engines 
we may continue to experience an increase in warranty costs as compared to prior periods that could result in additional charges for adjustments to pre existing warranties 
in addition  as we identify opportunities to improve the design and manufacturing of our engines  we may incur additional charges for product recalls and field campaigns to address identified issues 
these charges may have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for more information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
operating cost saving initiatives we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure 
we have implemented a number of cost saving initiatives  including the consolidation of our north america truck and engine engineering operations  the relocation of our world headquarters to lisle  illinois  continued reductions in discretionary spending and employee headcount reductions 
as a result  our operating costs  which include sg a expenses and engineering and product development costs  decreased by million in  compared to the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of  we leveraged efficiencies identified through redesigning our organizational structure and began implementing new cost reduction initiatives  including an enterprise wide reduction in force  which we expect will contribute an estimated additional million to million of annual savings beginning in core business evaluation we are focused on improving our core north america truck and parts businesses 
in  we implemented an roic methodology  combined with an assessment of the strategic fit to our core business  to identify areas that are under performing or are non strategic 
we are working to fix  divest or close under performing and non strategic areas and expect to realize incremental benefits from these actions in the near future 
in addition  we are restructuring our business and rationalizing our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure 
this effort is ongoing  and may lead to additional divestitures of businesses or discontinuing engineering programs that are outside of our core operations or are not performing to our expectations 
as a result of these evaluations  in  we divested our interests in the mahindra joint ventures in february  the wcc business in march  substantially all of our interest in certain operations of the monaco rv business in may  and bison coach in october we also entered into an agreement to sublease a portion of our manufacturing facility in cherokee  alabama 
also in  we completed the consolidation of our testing and validation activities into our melrose park  illinois  facility  and we closed our garland  texas truck manufacturing plant 
in  we consolidated our executive management  certain business operations  and product development into our world headquarters site in lisle  illinois 
in july  we announced our intention to close our chatham  ontario truck manufacturing plant  our union city  indiana chassis plant  and our monaco motor coach plant in coburg  oregon  which was subsequently sold in we continue to evaluate our options to optimize our operations 
we expect to realize incremental benefits from these actions in the near future 
global economy the global economy  and in particular the economies in the us and brazil markets  are continuing to recover  and the related financial markets have stabilized 
however  the impact of the economic recession and financial turmoil on the global markets pose a continued risk as customers may postpone spending  in response to tighter credit  negative financial news  and or declines in income or asset values 
lower demand for our customers products or services could also have a material negative effect on the demand for our products 
in addition  there could be exposure related to the financial viability of certain key third party suppliers  some of which are our sole source for particular components 
lower expectations of growth and profitability have resulted in impairments of long lived assets in the past and we could continue to experience pressure on the carrying values of our assets if conditions persist for an extended period of time 
impact of government regulation as a manufacturer of trucks and engines  we continue to face significant governmental regulation of our products  especially in the areas of environmental and safety matters 
we are also subject to various noise standards imposed by federal  state  and local regulations 
government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the us federal and state levels 
because our products use fossil fuels  they may be impacted indirectly due to regulation  such as a cap and trade program  affecting the cost of fuels 
in  the initial phase in of obd requirements commenced for the initial family of truck engines and those products have been certified 
the phase in for the remaining engine families occurred in in  the epa and nhtsa issued final rules setting greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards for medium and heavy duty engines and vehicles  which begin to apply in and are fully implemented in model year the next phase of federal greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy rules are currently under discussion and anticipated for the model year 
california is also in the initial stages of considering greenhouse gas emission rules for heavy duty vehicles 
the company plans to comply with these rules through the use of our existing technologies combined with certain third party components  as well as the implementation of emerging technologies as they become available 
as a result  the company expects to incur additional engineering and product development expenses to comply with these rules

north america truck segment in millions  except change change change north america truck segment sales  net north america truck segment loss segment sales the north america truck segment net sales decrease of billion  or  was primarily due to lower truck volumes across all truck classes in our traditional market  reflecting reduced sales volumes as we transition our engine strategy  as well as the impact of lower industry volumes 
we continued to meet or exceed our scheduled product launches and experienced no production gaps during our transition to our new engine emission strategy in  however  we have experienced lower volumes and  to a lesser extent  some pressure on pricing 
additionally  our military sales were lower reflecting lower chargeouts and service revenue 
chargeouts from our traditional market were down  reflecting declines in our class and medium trucks  class severe service trucks  as well as class heavy trucks  and to a lesser extent  school buses 
also in the second quarter of  the company recorded certain out of period adjustments for the correction of prior period errors  relating to certain third party equipment financings by ge that we have accounted for as borrowings 
correcting the errors resulted in a decrease of million to net sales related to periods prior to for more information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
segment loss the north america truck segment loss was comparable to the prior year  reflecting the impact of the transition in our engine emission strategy  which has resulted in lower margins and the under absorption of fixed costs 
also contributing to the segment loss were charges for adjustments to pre existing warranties of million and million in and  respectively 
these charges were primarily related to certain emission standard engines  which included charges related to extended warranty contracts on our maxxforce big bore engines  as well as costs related to certain field campaigns we initiated to address issues in products sold  partially offset by the recognition of a warranty recovery of million  which occurred in the first quarter of additionally  the segment incurred asset impairment charges of million 
the charges consisted of i million of charges related to the impairment of goodwill of our north america truck reporting units  and ii million of other asset impairment charges  which were primarily the result of our ongoing evaluation of our portfolio of assets to validate their 
table of contents strategic and financial fit  which led to the discontinuation of certain engineering programs related to products that were determined to be outside of our core operations or not performing to our expectations

in and  the segment recorded charges of million and million  respectively  for non conformance penalties ncps  primarily for certain l engines sales 
going forward  we expect the charges for ncps to decrease due to higher sales of trucks that include our engines with the cummins scr after treatment system  as well as sales of trucks that incorporate the cummins isx l engine 
offsetting these factors were declines in sg a expenses and engineering and product development costs  as well as lower restructuring charges 
the lower sg a expenses reflect the impact of our cost reduction initiatives 
the lower engineering and product development costs were primarily due to project rationalization of certain engineering programs and other savings from cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by costs to i integrate the cummins scr after treatment systems with our maxxforce l engine and other engine models  ii integrate the cummins isb into certain truck models  and iii rationalize content in our maxxforce l engine

this non gaap financial information should be considered supplemental to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap 
however  we believe that non gaap reporting  giving effect to the adjustments shown in the reconciliation above  provides meaningful information and therefore we use it to supplement our us gaap reporting by identifying items that may not be related to the core manufacturing business 
management often uses this information to assess and measure the performance and liquidity of our operating segments 
our manufacturing operations  for this purpose  include our north america truck segment  global operations segment  north america parts segment  and corporate items which include certain eliminations 
the reconciling differences between these non gaap financial measures and our us gaap consolidated financial statements in item  financial statements and supplementary data  are our financial services operations and adjustments required to eliminate certain intercompany transactions between manufacturing operations and financial services operations 
our financial services operations cash flows are presented consistent with their treatment in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and may not be consistent with how they would be treated on a stand alone basis 
we have chosen to provide this supplemental information to allow additional analyses of operating results  to illustrate the respective cash flows giving effect to the non gaap adjustments shown in the above reconciliation and to provide an additional measure of performance and liquidity

those projects are evaluated from the perspective of expected return and strategic importance  with a goal to maintain annual capital expenditures of approximately million  exclusive of capital expenditures for equipment leased to others 
see note  debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits generally  our pension plans are funded by contributions made by us 
our policy is to fund the pension plans in accordance with applicable us and canadian government regulations and to make additional contributions from time to time 
at october   we have met all legal funding requirements 
we contributed million and million to our pension plans in and  respectively 
in  the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of was signed into law  which provides  among other things  the ability to reduce and defer required pension contributions that otherwise would have been required under the pension protection act of ppa 
in july  the moving ahead for progress in the st century map act was signed into law  impacting the minimum funding requirements for pension plans  but does not otherwise impact our accounting for pension benefits 
as a result of the map act  we lowered our funding expectations 
in  we expect to contribute million to meet the minimum required contributions for all plans 
we currently expect that from through  the company will be required to contribute at least million per year to the plans  depending on asset performance and discount rates 
other postretirement benefit obligations  such as retiree medical  are primarily funded in accordance with the settlement agreement between us  our employees  retirees  and collective bargaining organizations  which eliminated certain benefits provided prior to that date and provided for cost sharing between us and participants in the form of premiums  co payments  and deductibles 
our contributions totaled million and million in and  respectively 
we expect to contribute million to our other post employment benefit plans during as part of the settlement agreement  a base program trust was established in june to provide a vehicle for funding the health care liability through our contributions and retiree premiums 
a separate independent retiree supplemental benefit program was also established  which included our contribution of class b common stock  originally valued at million  to potentially reduce retiree premiums  co payments  and deductibles and provide additional benefits in subsequent periods 
in addition to the base program trust  we are contingently obligated to make profit sharing contributions to the retiree supplemental benefit trust to potentially improve upon the basic benefits provided through the base program trust 
these profit sharing contributions are determined by means of a calculation as established through the settlement agreement 
there were no profit sharing contributions to the retiree supplemental benefit trust during the three years ended october  the funded status of our plans is derived by subtracting the actuarially determined present value of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets at year end 
the under funded status of our pension plans on a gaap basis decreased by million during primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected benefit obligations 
our actual return on assets during was approximately for the us pension plans 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure the postretirement benefit obligation pbo was at october   compared to at october  in february  the postretirement pension plans the plans entered into a three year put spread collar hedge covering a majority of the plans assets 
the hedge is expected to provide protection against certain equity losses while allowing participation in equity gains up to a limit per annum over the three year term of the hedge 
in addition to the asset hedge  in february  the plans entered into a three year zero cost swaption collar 
the hedge is designed to protect the liabilities of the plans against lower interest rates  while allowing participation in the positive benefits that would result if interest rates rise up to a predefined level over the life of the hedge 
given the improvements in the equity markets and changes to the shape of the yield curve  the hedge position was restructured in march by monetizing gains generated by the swaption strategy and using the proceeds to increase the equity protection level to reflect the increase in equity values since the inception of the hedge in february the result was that we were able to maintain the equity protection and swaption collar strategies and receive more attractive equity downside protection with no impact on collateral requirements 

table of contents the under funded status of our health and life insurance benefits decreased by million primarily due to an increase in the discount rate 
we continue to seek opportunities to control our pension and other postretirement benefits expenses 
for more information  see note  postretirement benefits  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into various arrangements not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
the principal off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into are guarantees and sales of receivables 
the following discussions address each of these items guarantees we occasionally provide guarantees that could obligate us to make future payments if the primary entity fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
these include residual value guarantees  stand by letters of credit and surety bonds  credit and purchase commitments and indemnifications 
we have recognized liabilities for some of these guarantees in our consolidated balance sheets as they meet recognition and measurement provisions 
in addition to the liabilities that have been recognized  we are contingently liable for other potential losses under various guarantees that are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not believe claims that may be made under such guarantees would have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
for more information  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sales of receivables our financial services operations typically sell  for legal purposes  our finance receivables to third parties while continuing to service the receivables thereafter 
in these securitization transactions  we transfer receivables to a bankruptcy remote spe 
the spe then transfers the receivables to a legally isolated entity that is typically a trust or a conduit  which then issues asset backed securities to investors 
effective november   none of our securitization or conduit arrangements qualified for sales accounting treatment 
as a result  the transferred receivables and the associated secured borrowings are included in our consolidated balance sheets and no gain or loss is recorded for these transactions 
contractual obligations the following table provides aggregated information on our outstanding contractual obligations as of october  payments due by year ending october  in millions total type of contractual obligation long term debt obligations interest on long term debt a financing arrangements and capital lease obligations b operating lease obligations c purchase obligations d total a amounts represent estimated contractual interest payments on outstanding debt 
rates in effect as of october  are used for variable rate debt 
for more information  see note  debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
b we lease many of our facilities as well as other property and equipment under financing arrangements and capital leases in the normal course of business  including million of interest obligations 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  net  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
c lease obligations for facility closures are included in operating leases 
future operating lease obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  net  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
d purchase obligations include various commitments in the ordinary course of business that would include the purchase of goods or services and they are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of cash payments associated with the settlement of audits with taxing authorities and because of existing net operating loss carry forwards  the preceding table excludes uncertain tax positions of million 
we do not expect to make significant payments of these liabilities within the next year 
for additional information  see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in addition to the above contractual obligations  we are also required to fund our pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the ppa 
as such  we expect to contribute million in to meet the minimum required contributions for all plans 
we currently expect that from through  the company will be required to contribute at least million to the plans per year depending on asset performance and discount rates in the next several years 
for additional information  see note  postretirement benefits  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other information income taxes we file a consolidated us federal income tax return for nic and its eligible domestic subsidiaries 
our non us subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards 
deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using enacted tax rates 
as of october  and  we had deferred tax asset valuation allowances of billion and billion  respectively 
a valuation allowance is required to be established or maintained when  based on currently available information  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the guidance on accounting for income taxes provides that important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized are whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient taxable income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
we believe that our evaluation of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance against such assets involve critical accounting estimates because they are subject to  among other things  estimates of future taxable income in the us and in us tax jurisdictions 
these estimates are susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance is material to the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheets and changes in the valuation allowance may be material to our results of operations 
we intend to continue to assess our valuation allowance in accordance with the guidance on accounting for income taxes 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax benefit expense 
total interest and penalties related to our uncertain tax positions resulted in an income tax expense of million  benefit of million  and expense of million for the years ended october    and respectively 
as of october  and  the amount of liability for uncertain tax positions was million and million  respectively 
if these unrecognized tax benefits are recognized  all but million would impact our effective tax rate 
however  to the extent we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  the effect may be in the form of an increase in the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carry forward  which would be offset by a full valuation allowance 
while it is probable that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease during the next twelve months  we do not expect any such change would have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate income taxes among continuing operations  discontinued operations  extraordinary items  other comprehensive income loss  and additional paid in capital when we meet the criteria as prescribed in the rule 
environmental matters we have been named a prp  in conjunction with other parties  in a number of cases arising under an environmental protection law  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  popularly known as the superfund law 
these cases involve sites that allegedly received wastes from current or former company locations 
based on information available to us which  in most cases  consists of data related to quantities and characteristics of material generated at current or former company locations  material allegedly shipped by us to these disposal sites  as well as cost estimates from prps and or federal or state regulatory agencies for the cleanup of these sites  a reasonable estimate is calculated of our share  if any  of the probable costs and accruals are recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
these accruals are generally recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are not discounted to their present value 
we review all accruals on a regular basis and believe that  based on these calculations  our share of the potential additional costs for the cleanup of each site will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents two sites formerly owned by us i solar turbines in san diego  california  and ii the canton plant in canton  illinois  were identified as having soil and groundwater contamination 
two sites in sao paulo  brazil  where we are currently operating  were identified as having soil and groundwater contamination 
while investigations and cleanup activities continue at these and other sites  we believe that we have adequate accruals to cover costs to complete the cleanup of all sites 
impact of environmental regulation government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the us federal and state levels 
because our products use fossil fuels  they may be impacted indirectly due to regulation  such as a cap and trade program  affecting the cost of fuels 
the epa and nhtsa issued final rules for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy on september  these begin to apply in calendar year and will be fully implemented in model year the agencies stated goals for these rules were to increase the use of currently existing technologies 
the company plans to comply with these rules through use of existing technologies and implementation of emerging technologies as they become available 
several of the company vehicles have been certified early for the model year with the remaining vehicles and all engines required to be certified in the next phase of federal greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy regulations  anticipated for  is also under discussion among the relevant agencies  manufacturers  including the company  and other stakeholders 
canada adopted its version of fuel economy and or greenhouse gas emission regulations in february these regulations are substantially aligned with us fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission regulations 
california is also in the initial stages of considering greenhouse gas emission rules for heavy duty vehicles 
we expect that heavy duty vehicle and engine fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions rules will be under consideration in other global jurisdictions in the future 
these standards will impact development and production costs for vehicles and engines 
there will also be administrative costs arising from the implementation of the rules 
our facilities may be subject to regulation related to climate change and climate change itself may also have some impact on the company operations 
however  these impacts are currently uncertain and the company cannot predict the nature and scope of those impacts 
securitization transactions we finance receivables using a process commonly known as securitization  whereby asset backed securities are sold via public offering or private placement 
in a typical securitization transaction  we transfer a pool of finance receivables to a bankruptcy remote spe 
the spe then transfers the receivables to a legally isolated entity  generally a trust or a conduit  in exchange for securities of the trust which are then retained or sold into the public market or privately placed 
these securities are issued by the trust and are secured by future collections on the receivables sold to the trust 
when we securitize receivables  we may have retained interests in the receivables sold transferred 
the retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities  undivided interests in receivables and over collateralizations  restricted cash held for the benefit of the trust  and interest only strips 
our retained interests are the first to absorb any credit losses on the transferred receivables because we have the most subordinated interests in the trust  including subordinated securities  the right to receive excess spread interest only strip  and any residual or remaining interests of the trust after all asset backed securities are repaid in full 
our exposure to credit losses on the transferred receivables is limited to our retained interests 
the spe assets are available to satisfy the creditors claims against the assets prior to such assets becoming available for the spe own uses or the uses of our affiliated companies 
since the transfer constitutes a legal sale  we are under no obligation to repurchase any transferred receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default 
we are not responsible for credit losses on transferred receivables other than through our ownership of the lowest tranches in the securitization structures 
we do not guarantee any securities issued by trusts 
we  as seller and the servicer of the finance receivables  are obligated to provide certain representations and warranties regarding the receivables 
should any of the receivables fail to meet these representations and warranties  we  as servicer  are required to repurchase the receivables 
effective november   none of our securitization arrangements qualify for sale accounting treatment under the guidance on accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
as a result  such sold receivables and associated secured borrowings are included on the consolidated balance sheets and no gain or loss is recognized for these transactions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and make judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
our assumptions  estimates  and judgments are based on historical experience  current trends  and other factors we believe are relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and should be reviewed in connection with the following discussion 
we believe that the following policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported results as they require us to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
in determining whether an estimate is critical  we consider if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  or the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide pension and other postretirement benefits to a substantial portion of our employees  former employees  and their beneficiaries 
the assets  liabilities  and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  expected return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates  rate of compensation increases  and other factors including management plans regarding plant rationalization activities 
changes to our business environment could result in changes to the assumptions  the effects of which could be material 
plant rationalization activities impact the determination of whether a plan curtailment or settlement has occurred 
key considerations include  but are not limited to  expected future service credit  the remaining years of recall rights of the workforce  and the extent to which minimum service requirements in the case of healthcare benefits have been met 
the discount rates are obtained by matching the anticipated future benefit payments for the plans to the citigroup yield curve to establish a weighted average discount rate for each plan 
health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data  short term health care outlook  and industry benchmarks and surveys 
the inflation assumptions used are based upon both our specific trends and nationally expected trends 
the expected return on plan assets is derived from historical plan returns  expected long term performance of asset classes  asset allocations  input from an external pension investment advisor  and risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy 
the focus is on long term trends and provides for the consideration of recent plan performance 
retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience 
mortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience 
the rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and our projected future increases including contractually agreed upon wage rate increases for represented employees 
the sensitivities stated below are based upon changing one assumption at a time  but often economic factors impact multiple assumptions simultaneously 
october  expense obligations in millions pension opeb pension opeb discount rate increase of decrease of expected return on assets increase of na na decrease of na na as modeled above  net periodic postretirement benefits expense is not highly sensitive to changes in discount rates in the current interest rate environment due to the relatively short duration of the closed plans 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts for finance receivables is established through a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the allowance is an estimate of the amount required to absorb losses on the existing portfolio of finance receivables that may become uncollectible 
we have two portfolio segments of finance receivables based on the type of financing inherent to each portfolio 
the retail portfolio segment represents loans or leases to end users for the purchase or lease of vehicles 
the wholesale portfolio segment represents loans to dealers to finance their inventory 
as the initial measurement attributes and the monitoring and assessment of credit risk or the performance of the receivables are consistent within each of our receivable portfolios  the company determined that each portfolio consists of one class of receivable 
finance receivables are charged off to the allowance for doubtful accounts when amounts due from the customers are determined to be uncollectible 
the estimate of the required allowance for both the retail portfolio segment and the wholesale portfolio segment is based upon three factors i a historical component based on actual loss experience and customer payment history  ii a qualitative component based upon current economic and portfolio quality trends  and iii a specific reserve component 
the qualitative component is the result of analysis of asset quality trend statistics from the most recent four quarters 
in addition  we also analyze specific economic indicators such as tonnage  fuel prices  and gross domestic product for additional insight into the overall state of the economy and its potential impact on our portfolio 
to the extent that our judgments about these risk factors and conditions are not accurate  an adjustment to our allowance for losses may materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 
if we were to apply a hypothetical increase and decrease of ten percent to the historical loss rate used in calculating the allowance for losses  the required allowance  as of october   would increase from million to million or decrease to million 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when  based on currently available information  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate recovery of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and other factors such as the taxing jurisdiction in which the asset is to be recovered 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent to which  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances at october  and aggregating billion and billion  respectively  against such assets based on our assessment of past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
of these amounts  million relate to net operating losses for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be allocated to additional paid in capital 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax benefit expense 
we apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate income taxes among continuing operations  discontinued operations  extraordinary items  other comprehensive income loss  and additional paid in capital when we meet the criteria as prescribed in the rule 
impairment of long lived assets we test long lived assets or asset groups other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as discussed below for recoverability when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset or asset group include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
if the asset or asset group is determined to not be recoverable  an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgments in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections and  at times  assessing probability weightings to certain business scenarios 
other long lived assets could become impaired in the future or require additional charges as a result of declines in 
table of contents profitability due to changes in volume  market pricing  cost  manner in which an asset is used  expectation of sale or disposal of an asset  physical condition of an asset  laws and regulations  or the business environment 
significant adverse changes to our business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record additional impairment charges in future periods  which could be material 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently  if circumstances change or an event occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
qualitative factors may be assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the qualitative assessment indicates that the carrying amount is more likely than not higher than the fair value  goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two step test 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions  and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the income approach is based on discounted cash flows which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each respective reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed certain changes to our organizational and reporting structures that reflect how our new codm assesses the performance of our operating segments and makes decisions about resource allocations 
as a result  we determined our reporting segments consist of north america truck  north america parts  global operations  and financial services 
this change resulted in a change in certain of our reporting units and a review of the recoverability of our goodwill in the north america truck reporting unit 
the income approach  which was based on discounted cash flows was used in the impairment analysis for the reporting unit 
as a result of the goodwill impairment analysis  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 
during  a brazilian reporting unit with goodwill of million experienced declines in forecasted results and cashflow 
as a result of these factors as well as slower than expected growth in the brazilian economy and a weakening of the brazilian currency  we performed an impairment analysis in the third and fourth quarters 
the income approach which is based on discounted cash flows which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations was used in the impairment analysis of the reporting unit 
as a result of the goodwill impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill was not impaired and that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by less than 
as of october  we have million of goodwill 
it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months  we could recognize goodwill impairment charges for certain reporting units if we have declines in profitability due to changes in volume  market pricing  cost  or the business environment 
significant adverse changes to our business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods  which could be material 
indefinite lived intangible assets an intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized until its useful life is determined to no longer be indefinite 
as of october   we have a balance of indefinite lived intangible assets of million 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when evaluating if an intangible asset has a finite useful life 
in addition  for indefinite lived intangible assets  significant judgment is applied in testing for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
we could recognize impairment charges in the future as a result of declines in the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets  which could be material 

table of contents contingency accruals product liability lawsuits and claims we are subject to product liability lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business 
we record product liability accruals for the self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions 
we estimate the expected ultimate losses for claims and  consequently  the related reserve in our consolidated balance sheets 
the actual settlement values of outstanding claims in the aggregate may differ from these estimates due to many circumstances  including but not limited to i the discovery and evolution of information related to individual claims  ii changes in the legal and regulatory environment  iii product development trends  and iv changes in the frequency and or severity of claims relative to historical experience 
the reserve for product liability was million as of october  and a hypothetical change in claim amount would increase or decrease this accrual by million 
environmental remediation matters we are subject to claims by various governmental authorities regarding environmental remediation matters 
with regard to environmental remediation  many factors are involved including interpretations of local  state  and federal laws and regulations  and whether wastes or other hazardous material are contaminating the surrounding land or water or have the potential to cause such contamination 
as of october   we have accrued million for environmental remediation 
although we believe that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our accrual that could be material 
asbestos claims we are subject to claims related to illnesses alleged to have resulted from asbestos exposure from component parts found in older vehicles  although some claims relate to the alleged presence of asbestos in our facilities 
numerous factors including tort reform  jury awards  and the number of other solvent companies identified as co defendants will impact the number of claims filed against the company 
we estimate the expected ultimate losses for claims and  consequently  the related reserve in our consolidated balance sheets 
the estimates related to asbestos claims are subject to uncertainty 
such uncertainty includes some reliance on industry data to project the future frequency of claims received by us  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposures and the types of diseases that will ultimately manifest  and unexpected future inflationary trends 
historically  actual damages paid out to individual claimants have not been material 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments related to asbestos related claims are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our accrual that could be material 
product warranty we generally offer one to five year warranty coverage for our truck  bus  and engine products  as well as our service parts 
terms and conditions vary by product  customer  and country 
we accrue warranty related costs under standard warranty terms and for certain claims outside the contractual obligation period that we choose to pay as accommodations to our customers 
our warranty estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  timing  and average cost of warranty claims 
warranty claims are influenced by numerous factors  including new product introductions  technological developments  the competitive environment  the design and manufacturing process  and the complexity and related costs of component parts 
we estimate our warranty accrual for our engines and trucks based on engine types and model years 
our warranty accruals take into account the projected ultimate cost per unit cpu utilizing historical claims information 
the cpu represents the total cash projected to be spent for warranty claims for a particular model year during the warranty period  divided by the number of units sold 
the projection of the ultimate cpu is affected by component failure rates  repair costs  and the timing of failures in the product life cycle 
warranty claims inherently have a high amount of variability in timing and severity and can be influenced by external factors 
our warranty estimation process takes into consideration numerous variables that contribute to the precision of the estimate  but also add to the complexity of the model 
including numerous variables also reduces the sensitivity of the model to any one variable 
we perform periodic reviews of warranty spend data to allow for timely consideration of the effects on warranty accruals 
we also utilize actuarial analysis in order to determine whether our accrual estimate falls within a reasonable range 
recent emissions standards have resulted in rapid product development cycles that have included significant changes from previous engine models 
component complexity and other related costs associated with meeting emissions standards have 
table of contents contributed to higher repair costs that exceeded those that we have historically experienced 
initial warranty estimates for new model year products are based on the previous model year product warranty experience until the new product progresses sufficiently through its life cycle and related claims data becomes mature 
historically  warranty claims experience for launch year products has been higher compared to the prior model year engines  however  over time we have been able to refine both the design and manufacturing process to reduce both the volume and the severity of warranty claims 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
for initial warranty estimates related to new launch year products  we consider historic experience from previous launches and may include a factor in our estimation process to account for the anticipated benefits of improvements in the design and manufacturing processes 
we record adjustments to pre existing warranties for changes in our estimate of warranty costs for products sold in prior fiscal years 
such adjustments typically occur when claims experience deviates from historic and expected trends 
throughout and  engine warranty claims experience was worse than historic experience and expectations 
as a result of the warranty spend during and evaluation of warranty data subsequent to year end  we recognized additional charges for adjustments to pre existing warranties of million 
future events and circumstances could materially change these estimates and require additional adjustments to our liability 
when we identify cost effective opportunities to address issues in products sold or corrective actions for safety issues  we initiate product recalls or field campaigns 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recalls and field campaigns  the liability for such actions are generally recorded when we commit to a product recall or field campaign 
included in warranty expense  was million of charges related to field campaigns we initiated to address issues in products sold  as compared to million in the prior year 
the charges were primarily recognized as adjustments to pre existing warranties 
as we continue to identify opportunities to improve the design and manufacturing of our engines we may incur additional charges for product recalls and field campaigns to address identified issues 
optional extended warranty contracts can be purchased for periods ranging from one to ten years 
warranty revenues related to extended warranty contracts are amortized to income  over the life of the contract using the straight line method 
costs under extended warranty contracts are expensed as incurred 
we recognize losses on extended warranty contracts when the expected costs under the contracts exceed related unearned revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of increases in warranty claims for our maxxforce big bore engine  including claims experience within the extended warranty contract periods  the company recognized additional charges of million 
total charges recognized for losses on extended warranty contracts in were million  which includes million related pre existing warranties 
in by comparison  we recognized total charges of million 
future warranty experience  pricing of extended warranty contracts  and external market factors may cause us to recognize additional charges as losses on extended service contracts in future periods 
when collection is reasonably assured  we also estimate the amount of warranty claim recoveries to be received from our suppliers and record them in other current assets and other noncurrent assets 
recoveries related to specific product recalls  in which a supplier confirms its liability under the recall  are recorded in trade and other receivables  net 
warranty costs are included in costs of products sold 
although we believe that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our warranty accrual that could be material 
recently issued and adopted accounting standards there are no recently issued accounting standards for which the company expects a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition  for the year ended october   the company has not adopted any new accounted guidance that has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
we are also exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used in our manufacturing operations 
commodity price risk related to our current commodity financial instruments are not material 
we do not hold a material portfolio of market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate market risk 
these procedures include the monitoring of our level of exposure to each market risk  the funding of variable rate receivables primarily with variable rate debt  and limiting the amount of fixed rate receivables that may be funded with floating rate debt 
these procedures also include the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations and to reduce our exposure to exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
we measure our interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
at october  and  the net fair value of our liabilities with exposure to interest rate risk was billion and billion  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  and  the fair value of these liabilities would increase by million and million  respectively 
at october  and  the net fair value of our assets with exposure to interest rate risk was billion and billion  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  and  the fair value of these assets would decrease by million and million  respectively 
our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rate yield curves 
the analysis  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of commodities  particularly for aluminum  copper  precious metals  resins  diesel fuel  and steel and their impact on the acquisition cost of various parts used in our manufacturing operations 
we have been able to mitigate the effects of price increases via a combination of design changes  material substitution  global sourcing  and price performance 
in certain cases  we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to price changes 
during and  we purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of commodities subject to market risk 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in commodity pricing  we would have incurred an additional million and million  respectively  of costs 
commodity price risk associated with our derivative position at october  and is not material to our operating results or financial position 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are the canadian dollar us dollar  mexican dollar us dollar  dollar us dollar  and brazilian real us dollar 
at october  and  the net fair value of our liabilities with exposure to foreign currency risk was million and million  respectively 
assuming that no offsetting derivative financial instruments exist  the reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be million and million at october  and  respectively 
at october  and  the net fair value of our assets with exposure to foreign currency risk was million and million  respectively 
assuming that no offsetting derivative financial instruments exist  the reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be million and million at october  and  respectively
