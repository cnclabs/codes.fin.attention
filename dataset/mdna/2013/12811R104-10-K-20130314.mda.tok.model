item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide investment advisory services to institutions and individuals  managing billion in client assets as of december  through a variety of investment products designed to suit their investment needs 
in the third quarter we began reporting total assets 
total assets includes assets under management totaling billion as well as million of assets in which we provide model portfolio design and oversight 
total assets our operating results fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of our total assets and with our ability to manage variable expenses 
the following table details our total assets  based on the four investment product types we offer in the funds and separate account categories  as of december   and in millions funds open end funds closed end funds total funds separate accounts institutional accounts managed accounts total separate accounts total assets in order to increase our total assets and expand our business  we must develop and market investment products and strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients investors seeking superior  risk adjusted returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our total assets and our ability to continue to attract and retain clients will depend on a variety of factors  including  among others purchases and redemptions of shares of the open end funds and other investment products  the amount of distributed and reinvested capital gains and income  fluctuations in the global financial markets and the valuations of securities that result in appreciation or depreciation of assets  the use of leverage within the closed end funds  our ability to educate our target clients about our investment philosophy and provide them with best in class service  the relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products as compared to competing offerings and market indices  competitive conditions in the asset management and broader financial services sectors  investor sentiment and confidence  and our introduction of new investment strategies and products  and our decision to close and re open strategies when deemed in the best interests of our clients 
investment products funds funds include our open end and closed end funds  which are commingled investment vehicles registered under the investment company act of  as amended  investment company act as well as our dublin  ireland domiciled calamos global funds plc  also referred to as offshore funds 
open end funds 
open end funds are continually offered and are not listed on an exchange 
open end funds issue new shares for purchase and redeem shares from shareholders who sell 
the share price for purchases and redemptions of open end funds is determined by each fund s net asset value  which is calculated at the end of each business day 
assets in open end funds vary as a result of both market appreciation and depreciation and the level of new purchases or redemptions of shares of a fund 
investment management fees  including performance based fees  are our principal source of revenue from open end funds and are primarily derived from assets under management 
we offer several share classes in each open end fund to provide investors with alternatives to pay for commissions  distribution and service fees 
closed end funds 
closed end funds typically sell a finite number of shares to investors through underwritten public offerings 
after the public offerings  investors buy closed end fund shares from  and sell those shares to  other investors through an exchange or broker dealer market 
all of the closed end funds that we manage currently use leverage which increases their total assets 
assets in closed end funds vary due to the amount of assets raised in underwritten public offerings  the amount of leverage utilized and market appreciation or depreciation 
our revenues from closed end funds are derived from the investment management fees on the assets that we manage 
in addition  in a typical underwritten public offering  investors are charged a commission by the selling firms 
we do not receive or pay commissions in connection with sales of closed end fund shares  although we may pay asset based distribution and service fees  as well as one time distribution and service fees to underwriters for underwriting public offerings of closed end funds 
separate accounts separate accounts include institutional accounts and managed accounts for high net worth investors 
fund flows into and out of such accounts  which we refer to as purchases and redemptions  affect our level of total assets 
total assets from these accounts also vary as a result of market appreciation and depreciation 
our revenues from separate accounts are derived from investment management fees that we charge  including performance based fees where applicable 
provided below is a brief differentiation of these accounts institutional accounts are separately managed accounts for institutional investors  such as public and private pension funds  public funds  endowment funds and private investment funds 
institutional accounts also include sub advised portfolios  such as registered investment companies  where we act as investment advisor but for which we have limited or no distribution responsibilities 
institutional accounts are typically offered directly by us through institutional consultants and through national and regional broker dealers 
managed accounts are separately managed accounts for high net worth investors offered primarily through national and regional broker dealers 
managed accounts also include accounts for which we provide model portfolio design and oversight 
revenues our revenues are substantially comprised of investment management fees earned under contracts with the funds and separate accounts managed by us 
the distribution of total assets among our investment products has an impact on our investment management fees  as some products carry different fees than others 
investment management fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value and composition of our total assets  the amount of capital gain and income distributions  market appreciation or depreciation  the use of leverage within our closed end products  relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products and strategies compared to benchmarks and competitors  level of net sales and redemptions  which represent the sum of new client assets  additional funding from existing clients  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  and purchases and redemptions of open end fund shares  a determination by the independent trustees of the funds to terminate or significantly alter the funds investment management agreements with us  and increased competition 
our revenues also are comprised of distribution and underwriting fees 
asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  discussed below  are a significant component of distribution and underwriting fees 
distribution and underwriting fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value of our assets under management  total composition of our assets under management by share class  market appreciation or depreciation  and the level of purchases and redemptions 
investment management fees investment management fees that we receive from funds for which we act as investment advisor are computed monthly on an average daily net asset value basis 
investment management fees that we earn on separate accounts for which we act as investment advisor are generally computed quarterly  either in advance or in arrears  based on the average total assets or total assets at the beginning or end of the quarterly period 
we recognize the revenues derived from these fees over the period during which we render investment advisory services 
distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting fees include asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  front end sales charges and contingent deferred sales charges 
rule b distribution and or service fees are asset based fees that the open end funds pay us over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of rule b of the investment company act 
these fees are typically calculated as a percentage of average daily net assets in specific share classes of the open end funds 
these fees fluctuate with both the level of average daily net assets and the relative mix of assets among share classes 
rule b fees are generally offset by distribution and service expenses paid during the period  as well as the amortization of deferred sales commissions that were previously paid by us to third parties 
we earn front end sales charges on the sale of class a shares of open end funds  which provide for a sales charge at the time of investment 
we retain a portion of the applicable sales charge and record as underwriting revenue only the portion that we retain 
we retain the entire sales charge earned on accounts where calamos financial services acts as the broker dealer 
sales charges are waived on sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum dollar amounts and other specified conditions 
sales charges fluctuate with both the level of class a share sales and the mix of class a shares offered with and without a sales charge 
contingent deferred sales charges are earned on redemptions of class b shares within six years of purchase and on redemptions of class c shares within one year of purchase 
contingent deferred sales charges fluctuate primarily based on the length of the investment in class b and class c shares 
waivers of contingent deferred sales charges apply under certain circumstances 
other revenues other revenues consist primarily of portfolio accounting fees  which are contractual payments calculated as a percentage of combined assets of the funds for financial accounting services  such as establishing expense accruals and performing tax calculations 
the fees were calculated based on the average daily assets of the open end and closed end funds 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits  distribution expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  marketing and sales promotion expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
these expenses fluctuate due to a number of factors  including but not limited to  the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  incentive compensation  changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors  changes in distribution expense and amortization of the deferred sales commissions as a result of fluctuations in open end fund sales and level of redemptions  market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management which will directly impact distribution expenses  the amount of rule b distribution and or service fees that we receive  as well as our continued ability to receive those fees in the future  which would affect the amortization expenses associated with the receipt of these fees  changes in the level of our marketing and promotion expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to further penetrate and support new and existing distribution channels and clients  and expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  professional services  depreciation  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure 
we have and will continue to adjust the level of expenses relative to business income and continue to seek opportunities to implement a more variable cost structure 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  incentive compensation and related benefits costs 
employee compensation and benefits are benchmarked against the competitive market landscape  including industry compensation standards 
in order to attract and retain qualified personnel  we must maintain competitive employee compensation and benefits 
in normal circumstances  we expect to experience a general rise in employee compensation and benefits expenses over the long term 
we use a fair value method in recording compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock options granted under our incentive stock plan 
under the fair value method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
fair value is determined on the date granted using the black scholes option pricing model for the stock options and is determined by the market value of the underlying stock for restricted stock units 
distribution expenses distribution expenses include payments that we make to broker dealers and other intermediaries for selling  underwriting  servicing and administering open end funds 
this expense is influenced by new open end funds sales  levels of redemptions and market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management in these products 
this expense is comprised of rule b distribution and or service fee payments to the selling firms 
amortization of deferred sales commissions as discussed  we pay commissions to selling firms upon the sale of class c shares and previously paid commissions on the sale of class b shares of open end funds 
as we pay these commissions  we create a deferred sales commission asset on our consolidated statement of financial condition 
we amortize these assets over either the average remaining lives of the assets or the period in which we receive related asset based distribution and or service fees pursuant to rule b plans 
amortization expenses generally offset the rule b fees we receive from the funds shareholders over this same period 
in addition  because rule b fees cease upon the redemption of the open end fund shares  amortization expenses are accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in an increase in amortization expense and a reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include marketing and sales promotion expenses and general and administrative expenses 
marketing and sales promotion expenses generally vary based on the type and level of marketing  educational  sales or other programs in operation and include closed end fund marketing costs and ongoing and one time payments to broker dealers 
in addition  as the open end funds that we manage have grown in size and recognition over time and in normal circumstances  we have become subject to supplemental compensation payments to third party selling agents  which are a component of marketing and sales promotion expense 
we expect supplemental compensation payments to fluctuate with changes in assets under management 
in connection with closed end funds  we make fee payments to certain underwriters for distribution  consulting and or support services rendered during or after the offering period of each closed end fund 
these fees are based on contractual agreements with underwriting firms and may be paid over time based on the average daily net assets of such funds or at the close of the offering period based on the amount of assets raised during the offering 
general and administrative expenses primarily include occupancy related costs  depreciation and professional and business services 
these expenses generally fluctuate in relative proportion to the number of employees employed by us and the overall size and scale of our business operations 
impact of distribution and underwriting activities in order to grow assets under management  we engage in distribution and underwriting activities  principally with respect to our family of open end funds 
when analyzing our business  we consider the result of these distribution activities on a net revenue basis as they are typically a result of a single open end fund share purchase 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires that we present these activities on a gross revenue basis  thus resulting in a reduction to our overall operating margin  as the margin on distribution activities is generally lower than the margins on the remainder of our business 
while we do not adjust our margin for these activities on a net revenue basis  we believe the margin table below is useful to understanding the impact of distribution activities on our margin 
the following table summarizes the net distribution fee margin for the years ended december  and in thousands distribution and underwriting fees distribution expenses amortization of deferred sales commissions net distribution fees net distribution fee margin the net distribution fee margin varies by share class so the mix of sales and assets by share class affects the overall net distribution fee margin 
the decline in the net distribution fee margin is primarily due to the decline in class b and c share revenues and contingent deferred sales charge revenues  partially offset by a decline in distribution expenses and amortization of deferred sales commissions 
the decline in both class shares is due to net redemptions on certain open end funds  some of which were closed to new investors during the year  and to a lesser extent  the composition of open end funds moving to class i shares  which do not have distribution fees 
net distribution fee margin has different distribution and underwriting activities  which are described below 
class a shares represented billion of our us clients total assets as of december  these shares provide for a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
the sales charge is equal to a maximum of of the amount invested 
we retain an underwriting fee representing a portion of this sales charge and pay any remaining amounts to the selling firm 
we retained underwriting fees of  for the year ended december  we receive rule b distribution and service fees on class a shares at a rate of of class a share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   we received class a share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class a share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the distribution fee margin that we earn on class a shares is largely driven by the distribution fees that we earn as broker of record and by the portion of front end sales charges that we retain  which fluctuate with both the total class a share sales and the mix of class a share sales with and without a sales charge 
the percentage of class a share sales made without a sales charge has been increasing 
if this trend continues  we expect that our class a share net distribution fee margin will decrease 
class b shares represented million of our us clients total assets as of december  during we discontinued the sale of class b open end funds 
prior to us closing this share class to new sales  investors in class b shares did not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we paid an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment was made 
this advanced payment was capitalized as a deferred sales commission asset when paid and is amortized on a straight line basis over eight years unless a redemption occurs 
upon redemption  we write off the remaining asset to amortization of deferred sales commissions 
if the investor redeems shares within the first six years of investment  we receive a contingent deferred sales charge of between during the first year declining to during the sixth year based upon the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class b share contingent deferred sales charge payments of  we receive rule b fees on class b shares at the rate of of class b share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make rule b service fee payments to the selling firm at a rate of of class b share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
we retain a distribution fee to help us recover the upfront commissions that we paid to the selling firm 
rule b payments continue for eight years  at which point class b shares automatically convert into class a shares 
for the year ended december   we received class b share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class b share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the net distribution fee margin that we earn on class b shares is primarily the result of the difference between the annual distribution fee revenue that we receive on the average class b share assets under management and the amortization of the upfront commission over the life of the asset 
this differential creates a component of net distribution fee margin unique to class b shares that will remain constant before giving consideration to redemption activity or market appreciation or depreciation 
the net distribution fee margin on class b shares fluctuates due to the appreciation or depreciation of the underlying assets 
class c shares represented billion of our us clients total assets as of december  investors in class c shares do not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we pay an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment is made 
this advanced payment is capitalized as a deferred sales commission asset when paid and is amortized on a straight line basis over months 
for the year ended december   we made commission payments to selling firms of million 
if the investor redeems class c shares within one year of investment  we receive from the proceeds of the sale a contingent deferred sales charge payment equal to of the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class c share contingent deferred sales charge payments of  we receive rule b fees on class c shares at the rate of of class c share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make class c share rule b distribution and service fee payments to the selling firm beginning in the second year following the sale at the rate of of class c share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   we received class c share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class c share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the first year s rule b fees help us to recoup the upfront commission we paid to the selling firm  resulting in a net distribution fee margin on class c shares that is generally zero  before giving consideration to market appreciation or depreciation 
however  during the first months following the sale of class c shares  this margin will fluctuate due to the appreciation or depreciation of class c share assets 
appreciation or depreciation of the assets from the time of sale will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the distribution fee revenues 
we expect our distribution fee margin to increase as the underlying class c share assets appreciate and to decrease as these assets depreciate 
class i shares represented billion of our us clients total assets as of december  these shares do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees and are generally offered to individual and institutional investors making initial investments of million or more  therefore  no distribution fee margin exists for this share class 
class r shares are available for purchase through certain tax exempt retirement plans held in plan level or omnibus accounts and represented million of our us clients total assets as of december  investors in class r shares do not pay a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
we receive rule b fees on class r shares at a rate of of class r share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   the class r share b fees that we received and the class r share rule b payments that we made to selling firms were insignificant 
offshore funds represented million of our total assets as of december  offshore funds do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees 
offshore funds are generally offered to individual and institutional investors that are domiciled or that have citizenship outside the us these funds are comprised of various share classes with distribution fees that differ from the investment company share classes described above 
distribution fees received from the offshore funds vary by share class and may be negotiated with distribution partners 
these fees received from the offshore funds are recorded as distribution and underwriting fee revenue while the payments made to third party selling firms are recorded as distribution expenses 
for the year ended december   the offshore fund distribution fees received and paid were insignificant 
non operating income non operating income primarily represents net investment gains and losses from a portion of our investment portfolio and from the limited partnerships that we consolidate  net of non controlling interest in those partnerships 
capital gain distributions  dividends and net interest income or expense are also included in non operating income 
non controlling interest non controlling interest in calamos investments llc as sole manager of calamos investments llc calamos investments  we consolidate the financial results of calamos investments with our own results 
outstanding shares of our class a common stock represent  and of the ownership of calamos investments as of december   and  respectively 
we reflect calamos family partners  inc and john p 
calamos  sr 
s collective ownership of  and in calamos investments as of december   and  respectively  as a non controlling interest in our consolidated statements of financial condition  operations and changes in stockholders equity 
non controlling interest in calamos investments is derived by multiplying the historical equity of calamos investments by calamos family partners  inc and john p 
calamos  sr 
s collective ownership percentage for the periods presented 
issuances and repurchases of our class a common stock may result in changes to calamos asset management  inc s cam ownership percentage and to the non controlling interests ownership percentage of calamos investments 
the corresponding changes in ownership are reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity 
income is allocated to non controlling interests based on the average ownership interest during the period in which the income is earned 
as a result  our income before income tax provision  excluding calamos family partners  inc and john p 
calamos  sr

income before income tax provision includes interest and dividend income earned on cash and cash equivalents and certain expenses held solely by cam during the same period 
this investment income is not reduced by non controlling interest  therefore  the resulting non controlling interest as presented in the statement of operations differs slightly than their corresponding ownership percentage 
non controlling interest in partnership investments calamos advisors  a subsidiary of calamos investments  is the general partner and controls the operations of calamos international growth fund lp and indirectly is the general partner and controls the operations of calamos arista strategic fund lp  a us feeder fund to calamos arista strategic master fund ltd  a hedge fund in the cayman islands

the combined interests of these partnerships  not owned by us  are presented as non controlling interest in partnership investments in our consolidated financial statements for the periods those partnerships were consolidated 
income taxes for the years ended december   and  our effective tax rate was  and  respectively 
the december  and effective tax rate includes the impact of an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the increases in the valuation allowance were recorded as it is unlikely based upon market conditions that cam will be able to fully utilize its capital loss carryforward 
our consideration in recording the valuation allowance included our risk based approach to protecting our balance sheet and the remaining life of the capital loss carryforward 
the deferred tax valuation allowance increased our effective tax rate in and by and  respectively

the net decrease from our managed accounts in were due to net redemptions of million  partially offset by appreciation of million 
the net decrease from our institutional accounts were due to net redemptions of million  partially offset by appreciation of million 
institutional accounts net redemptions were driven primarily from redemptions in convertible strategies and were partially reduced by net inflows into equity strategies 
managed accounts net redemptions increase of million from to million in was as a result of an increase in redemptions in both equity and convertible strategies 
financial review revenues total revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower investment management fees  and distribution and underwriting fees 
change in thousands amount percent investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues investment management fees decreased by for the year ended december   as our average total assets decreased by billion  or  during the year 
investment management fees from open end funds decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  driven by an decrease in open end fund average assets 
investment management fees from our closed end funds increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year period  due to a increase in closed end fund average assets 
investment management fees from our separately managed accounts decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  due to a decrease in separately managed accounts average total assets 
the investment management fee rate that we earned for the year ended december  was and relatively constant when compared to the rate of 
distribution and underwriting fees decreased by  or million to million for the year ended december   due to lower asset based distribution fees across most share classes 
the decrease in distribution and underwriting fees were driven by an decrease in average open end fund assets when compared to the prior year largely due to net redemptions on certain open end funds  some of which were closed to new investors during the year 
to a lesser extent  the decrease in average open end fund assets is due to more open end fund investors choosing to compensate their financial advisors through fee based models  increasing the demand for and a shift in assets toward our class i shares that do not collect distribution fees 
other revenue principally reflects asset based portfolio accounting fees 
other revenue decreased by to million from the prior year 
portfolio accounting fees generally rise and fall with the changes in average fund assets that we manage 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this change reflects decreases in distribution expenses and amortization of deferred sales commissions  partially offset by increases in employee compensation and benefits expenses  marketing and sales promotion expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution expenses amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  this increase is mostly attributable to increases in salary and benefits expenses and accruals for performance based incentive compensation  partially offset by a reversal of equity compensation expense for forfeited awards 
the increases in our performance based incentive compensation and salary and benefit compensation is due to the increase in the number of associates we employ and our investment into more distribution and client focused personnel 
distribution expenses generally represent a pass through to financial intermediaries of rule b distribution and service fees that we earn from the family of funds that we manage and distribute 
these expenses are directly related to changes in average open end fund assets of class a  b and c shares  and the proportion of class c share assets less than one year old 
for the year ended december   distribution expenses decreased by million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this change is due to a decrease in the average assets of class a  b and c shares  and to a lesser extent a continued shift of average open end fund assets to class i shares which do not result in distribution expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in distribution expenses as a result of an increase in the average class c share assets older than one year 
as class c shares age past one year  the associated distribution fees are paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries 
as such  increases in the average class c share assets older than one year results in an increase in distribution expenses 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased by million for the year ended december   due to the aging of class c shares and to a lesser extent the aging of class b shares 
amortization of deferred sales commissions change with the level of new open end fund sales of class c shares and with class b share redemptions 
during  we discontinued the sales of class b shares  and as a result  the deferred sales commission assets are no longer replenished by new sales 
as a result of no new deferred sales commissions  we expect that amortization expense associated with class b share deferred sales commissions will continue to decrease as the remaining class b share assets redeem or convert to class a share assets over time 
marketing and sales promotion expenses increased by million for the year ended december   largely the result of an increase in waived fund expenses which limit the annual ordinary operating expenses of each fund  and an increase in marketing and sales promotion expenses due to our increased spending to build awareness around our investment strategies 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in supplemental distribution payments to distribution intermediaries 
supplemental distribution payments are positively correlated with the levels of open end fund assets that we manage 
general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended december  many offsetting factors gave rise to the net increase in expense during the net increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in travel expenses that occurred throughout the year and client reimbursements related to trade correction expenses that were recorded in the first quarter of non operating activities  net of non controlling interest in partnership investments non operating income  net of non controlling interest in partnership investments increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year

net inflows were strongest in our global and international strategies  which had net sales of million in the decrease in market values negatively impacted our funds by billion during compared to market appreciation of billion during separate accounts  which represent managed accounts for both institutions and individuals  combined net redemptions were flat at million during  compared to net redemptions of billion during the prior year 
the net outflows from our managed accounts in were due to net redemptions and depreciation of million and million  respectively 
the net outflows from our institutional accounts were due to depreciation of million  partially offset by net sales of million 
institutional accounts net sales were driven primarily from our institutional business  including winning a large asia institutional mandate as well as our growth in institutional accounts in international equity and emerging market strategies 
managed accounts net redemptions decrease of billion from to million in was as a result of an increase in redemptions during related to the increase in account minimums for our convertible based strategies on separately managed account platforms 
financial review revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher investment management fees  partially offset by lower distribution and underwriting fees 
change in thousands amount percent investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues investment management fees increased by for the year ended december   as our average total assets increased by billion  or  during the year 
investment management fees from open end funds increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  driven by an increase in open end fund average assets 
investment management fees from our closed end funds increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year period  due to an increase in closed end fund average assets 
investment management fees from our separately managed accounts increased by to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  due to an increase in separately managed accounts average total assets 
the investment management fee rate that we earned for the year ended december  was and relatively constant when compared to the rate of 
despite the fact that our average open end fund assets increased by when compared to the prior year  our distribution and underwriting fees decreased by  or million to million for the year ended december  the decrease in distribution fees was largely due to more open end fund investors choosing to compensate their financial advisors through fee based models  increasing the demand for and a shift in assets toward our class i shares 
because we do not collect distribution fees from class i shares  our distribution revenue has decreased with this shift in assets 
this shift in assets has had no adverse effect to the operating results of the company because our distribution expenses have decreased proportionately with the decrease in revenues 
to a lesser extent the decrease in distribution and underwriting fees is due to lower contingent deferred sales charges 
the decline in contingent deferred sales charges is as a result of the closing of our class b shares to new purchases resulting in less redemptions of class b shares in the early years  which are redeemed at higher contingent deferred sales charge rates than class b shares redeemed in later years 
other revenue principally reflects asset based portfolio accounting fees  which increased by to million from the prior year 
these fees will generally rise and fall with the changes in average fund assets that we manage 
operating expenses operating expenses rose by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this change reflects increases in employee compensation and benefits expenses  distribution expenses  and marketing and sales promotion expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution expenses amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  this increase is mostly attributable to an increase in performance based incentive compensation and to a lesser extent increases in salary and benefit compensation  partially offset by lower equity compensation 
the increases in our performance based incentive compensation and salary and benefit compensation is due to an increase in the number of associates we employ and our investment into more distribution and client focused personnel 
distribution expenses generally represent a pass through to financial intermediaries of rule b distribution and service fees that we earn from the family of funds that we manage and distribute 
these expenses are directly related to changes in average open end fund assets of class a  b and c shares  and the proportion of class c share assets less than one year old 
for the year ended december   distribution expenses increased by million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this change is due to an increase in the average assets of class a and c shares and an increase in the average class c share assets older than one year 
although the rule b fee rates we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we experienced a material shift of average open end fund assets to class i shares  which do not include a distribution expense 
as a result of this increase in class i share assets  distribution expenses did not grow at a rate commensurate with our average open end fund assets 
amortization of deferred sales commissions change with the level of new open end fund sales of class c shares and with class b share redemptions 
during  we discontinued the sales of class b shares  and as a result  the deferred sales commission assets are no longer replenished by new sales 
as a result of no new deferred sales commissions  we expect that amortization expense associated with class b share deferred sales commissions will continue to decrease as the remaining class b share assets convert to class a or i share assets over time 
marketing and sales promotion expenses increased by million for the year ended december   which was largely the result of an increase in fund administrative cap expenses  which are non reimbursable expenses we pay to reduce the service fees to our fund investors  and an increase in supplemental distribution payments to brokers 
the increase in supplemental distribution payments to brokers is directly correlated with the increase in average assets of our open end funds 
the increase in marketing and sales promotion expenses is also due to our increased spending to support a series of targeted marketing and advertising campaigns to build awareness about our investment strategies 
general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended december  many offsetting factors gave rise to the net increase in expense during as expected  professional service fees continued their upward trend in support of our initiative to outsource our middle office operations 
we expect this trend to continue until this outsourcing initiative is completed 
professional services also increased as a result of our initiative to review options for creating a greater degree of clarity regarding our market capitalization 
additionally  in support of expanding our international distribution efforts  travel related expenses have modestly increased during as compared to the impact of these items were partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expenses of more than million as certain equipment placed in service to accommodate our move into our headquarters have fully depreciated 
non operating activities  net of non controlling interest in partnership investments non operating income  net of non controlling interest in partnership investments decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to lower realized gains on our investment securities and higher net realized and unrealized losses on our option contracts 
in thousands change interest income interest expense net interest expense investment income dividend income miscellaneous other income investment and other income non operating income net income loss attributable to non controlling interest in partnership investments non operating income  net of non controlling interest in partnership investments interest income decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as a result of lower interest yields on cash balances 
interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december   as a result of our debt repayment of million in april investment income decreased by million to million for the year ended december  the majority of investment income reflects realized gains on the sale of investment securities generated as a part of a tax harvesting strategy to better utilize tax loss carry forwards that was implemented during dividend income for increased modestly to million from million during net income loss attributable to non controlling interest in partnership investments represents the portion of income or loss attributable to the other partners ownership interest in the partnership that we refer to as non controlling interests

income tax provision for the years ended december  and  our effective tax rate was and  respectively 
the december  effective tax rate includes the impact of an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance of million  to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the increase in the valuation allowance was recorded as it is unlikely based upon market conditions that cam will be able to fully utilize its capital loss carryforward 
our consideration in recording the valuation allowance included our risk based approach to protecting our balance sheet and the remaining life of the capital loss carryforward 
the deferred tax valuation allowance increased our effective tax rate by net income for the years ended december  and  net income attributable to cam was million and million  respectively 
for the same period non gaap net income attributable to cam was million and million  respectively 
see supplemental non gaap financial measures of the md a below for descriptions of non gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures 
supplemental non gaap financial measures we provide investors with certain adjusted  non gaap financial measures including non gaap net income attributable to cam and non gaap diluted earnings per share 
these non gaap financial measures are provided to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis 
these non gaap financial measures adjust gaap financial measures to include the tax benefit from the amortization of deferred taxes on intangible assets  and to exclude the increase in deferred tax valuation adjustment  certain professional service fees related to cam s review of options for creating a greater degree of clarity regarding our market capitalization and cam s non operating income  net of taxes 
we believe these adjustments are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our operating financial performance  as well as to facilitate comparisons with our historical earnings results 
these adjustments to our gaap results are made with the intent of providing investors a more complete understanding of our underlying earnings results and trends and our marketplace performance 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis of managing our business 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
investors should review the reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures as provided in the table below in thousands  except per share data net income attributable to cam exclude deferred tax amortization on intangible assets increase in deferred tax valuation allowance certain professional service fees  net of taxes cam s non operating income  net of taxes non gaap net income attributable to cam diluted weighted average shares outstanding diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share non gaap net income attributable to cam is calculated by adjusting the following items from gaap net income attributable to cam i amortization of deferred taxes on intangible assets associated with the election under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended section election  ii increase in deferred tax valuation allowance  iii certain professional service fees  net of taxes  and iv cam s non operating income  net of taxes 
non gaap diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing i non gaap net income attributable to cam by ii diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
the deferred tax assets from the section election allows for a quarterly reduction of million in future income taxes owed by us through  to the extent that a tax payable exists during the quarter 
as a result  this cash savings will accrue solely for the benefit of the shareholders of cam s common stock 
we believe that adjusting this item from the calculation of the above non gaap items can be a useful measure in allowing investors to see our performance 
the change in the allowance on the deferred tax asset is excluded from the above non gaap items as it may fluctuate in future periods affecting prior period comparisons 
certain professional service fees related to cam s review of options for creating a greater degree of clarity regarding our market capitalization and non operating income are excluded from the above non gaap items as they can distort comparisons between periods 
as noted above  we believe that measures excluding these items are useful in analyzing operating trends and allows for more comparability between periods  which may be useful to investors 
we believe that non gaap net income attributable to cam and non gaap diluted earnings per share are useful measures of performance and may be useful to investors  because they provide measures of our core business activities adjusting for items that are non cash and costs that may distort comparisons between periods 
these measures are provided in addition to our net income attributable to cam and diluted earnings per share calculated under gaap  but are not substitutes for those calculations 
liquidity and capital resources we manage our liquidity position to ensure adequate resources are available to fund ongoing operations of the business  provide seed capital for new funds  maintain conservative levels of capital for the company s regulated subsidiaries  fund our stock re purchase program announced in  and invest in other corporate strategic initiatives 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our corporate investment portfolio  which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents  investment securities  derivatives and partnership investments 
investment securities are principally comprised of company sponsored funds 
in addition  the individual securities held within our partnership investments are typically highly liquid 
our working capital requirements historically have been met through cash generated by operations 
we believe cash generated from operations will be sufficient over the foreseeable future to meet our working capital requirements with respect to the foregoing activities  as well as to support future growth 
further  we expect that cash on hand and through cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
the following table summarizes our principal sources of liquidity as of december  and december  in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents investment securities derivatives  net partnership investments  net of non controlling interests total corporate investment portfolio we utilize a hedging strategy using exchange traded equity option contracts as an economic hedge to reduce downside risk and price volatility of the total portfolio value as well as to support compliance with the financial ratios associated with our long term debt 
this strategy allowed us the flexibility to continue to provide seed capital for the development of new products when necessary  while seeking to help reduce risk and to maintain a solid credit rating 
calamos investments is the borrower of our million in outstanding debt 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  and the company currently has an investment grade bbb rating from standard poor s 
the following is a summary of covenant compliance as of december  with the terms and covenants having the same meanings set forth under our amended note purchase agreements covenant requirement results as of december  ebitda interest expense not less than debt ebitda not more than investment coverage ratio not less than net worth not less than million million the following table summarizes key data relating to our liquidity and capital resources in thousands december  december  statements of financial condition data cash and cash equivalents receivables investment securities and derivatives  net partnership investments  net deferred tax assets  net deferred sales commissions long term debt the deferred tax assets above include an annual reduction of million in future income taxes owed by us through this reduction results from our election under section of the internal revenue code  whereby we stepped up the tax basis in certain intangible assets to their fair market value 
these assets are amortized over fifteen years on cam s tax return 
as a result  this cash savings will accrue solely for the benefit of the shareholders of our common stock 
cash flows for the years ended december   and are shown below 
in thousands cash flow data net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these net cash flows are primarily attributed to net income of the company and are mostly generated by core business activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
the net cash used in investing activities represents an investment of million in calamos arista strategic fund lp  a newly established partnership  an investment of million in our new company sponsored global fund to help expand our product offering  and an investment of million in new investment strategies 
the net cash used in investing activities also represents net cash outflows of million as a result of derivatives  which are used as economic hedges against the equity price risk in our investment portfolio  and our million purchase of black capital  llc 
these outflows were partially offset by the liquidation of one of the company sponsored funds totaling million 
the remaining sales and re purchases of investing activities resulted in little change in cash used in investing activities 
these sales and re purchases of investments were the result of us realizing gains on our investment securities as a result of our tax harvesting strategy 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
the net cash used in investing activities during was primarily comprised of additional investments in company sponsored funds of million to help expand our product offering coupled with our net purchases of derivatives of million 
these flows were partially offset by cash flows of million and million provided by the liquidation of the calamos market neutral opportunities fund lp and the sale of our managed mutual funds  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
the net cash used in investing activities during was primarily comprised of additional investments in company sponsored funds of million to help expand our product offering coupled with our net purchases of derivatives of million 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million and largely represents pro rata income tax and equity distributions paid by calamos investments to cam and to our non controlling interests  in the amount of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million and largely represents pro rata income tax and equity distributions paid by calamos investments to cam and to our non controlling interests  in the amount of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million and largely represents pro rata income tax and equity distributions paid by calamos investments to cam and to our non controlling interests  in the amount of million and million  respectively 
distributions from calamos investments to cam are eliminated upon consolidation and are not reflected in the net cash flows used in financing activities 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities principally reflects decreases in tax distributions driven by a decline in net income attributable to our non controlling interests 
contractual obligations the following table contains supplemental information regarding our total contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations  including interest operating lease obligations other long term obligations total the company s senior unsecured notes  which aggregate to million  have series maturing in  and in accordance with gaap  these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
other long term obligations principally represent commitments under the incentive compensation plan and obligations associated with the purchase of black capital  llc 
these obligations are included in other non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of the company 
purchase obligations include executory contracts  which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty 
as of december   the company s obligations primarily include standard service contracts for portfolio  market data and office related services 
purchase obligations are recorded in the company s financial statements when services are provided 
due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid  the amounts have been excluded from the table above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
deferred sales commissions deferred sales commissions represent amounts advanced by us to the selling firm upon sale of class b and class c shares of open end funds 
deferred sales commissions are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which b fees are received 
annually  we estimate the average remaining life of the class b share deferred sales commissions to determine the period over which to amortize the remaining class b share assets on a straight line basis 
because b fees cease upon redemption of shares  amortization expense is accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in the reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
these redemptions result in an amortization period not to exceed months for class c shares and months eight years for class b shares 
we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred sales commissions for impairment on an annual basis 
significant assumptions utilized by us to estimate future average assets include expected future market performance and redemption rates 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from these assumptions 
market performance assumptions are selected using expected average market returns based on long term market index benchmarks for each asset class held within the fund 
as of our most recent analysis  we used average market return assumptions ranging from approximately to based on asset class 
if the average market returns are higher than estimated  undiscounted cash flows would be greater than those estimated  while lower actual returns on average would generate undiscounted future cash flows less than those estimated 
future redemption assumptions were determined by using the average annual redemption rates that each fund experienced over the prior month period 
for class b shares and class c shares  we used average historical redemption rates of and  respectively 
an increase in the actual rate of redemptions would decrease the undiscounted future cash flows  while a decrease in the actual rate of redemptions would increase undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually  or when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
if we determine that the deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable  an impairment condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the carrying value of the deferred sales commission asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the asset is written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows 
impairment adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of amortization of deferred sales commissions 
as of each reporting period presented  we determined that no impairment of the deferred commission asset existed  but due to the volatility of the capital markets and the changes in redemption rates  we are unable to predict whether or when future impairment of the deferred sales commission asset might occur 
we discontinued the sales of class b shares  and as a result  the deferred sales commission assets are no longer replenished by new sales 
compensation plans we have an incentive compensation plan that provides for grants of restricted stock unit awards rsus  and stock option awards for certain employees 
rsus are convertible on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock 
we estimate the fair value of the stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model  and recognize the cost of stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the award 
further  we estimate the number of forfeited awards at the grant date 
actual forfeitures may vary from our assumptions  which will result in modifications to future expenses 
income tax provision benefit management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was million and million  respectively  which was recorded during and  to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on available evidence at the time the estimate was made 
the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relates to our capital loss carryforward 
determining the valuation allowance requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions 
in determining the valuation allowance we used historical and forecasted future realized and unrealized gains and losses on our investments  and future tax planning strategies 
each quarter we re evaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance  including our assumptions about future taxable income 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance  recorded against this deferred tax asset is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or market appreciation depreciation on investments could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
if we were not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  a significant adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax provision in that period 
management determined that a valuation allowance was not required on our deferred tax assets related to our step up in tax basis to fair market value for our intangible assets under our election made under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in the event that sufficient taxable income of the same character is not recognized in future years  a valuation allowance may be required 
because the determination of our annual income tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates  it is likely that the actual results will vary from those recorded in our financial statements 
hence  we recognize additions to and reductions in income tax expense during a reporting period that pertains to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and our actual tax returns and tax audits are completed 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all newly issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our business and to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  including those not yet required to be adopted 
we do not believe any such pronouncements will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
accounting guidance that have become effective during or have not yet become effective with respect to our consolidated financial statements are described below in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance that requires an entity to provide additional information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments in this update supersede and replace the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in previously amended updates 
this guidance is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning on or after december  the company s effective date is january  the company has chosen to early adopt this guidance  which required the company to disclose the impact of realized gains on net income that were previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income and were reclassified out 
as this pronouncement is disclosure related  the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance that requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after january  an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
the company s effective date is january  as this pronouncement is disclosure related  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued new guidance allowing an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
this guidance is effective and will be adopted by the company when assessing impairment 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance that requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the company has elected the two separate but consecutive statements approach with the adoption of this guidance 
this guidance is effective and was adopted by the company during the first quarter of this year 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance to clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and to change particular principles or requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective and was adopted by the company during the first quarter of this year 
the adoption of this guidance has resulted in the company reporting the level in the fair value hierarchy and the observable inputs required for the calculation of the fair value of the company s long term debt and payment obligation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk securities price sensitivity our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisors for the funds and separate accounts we manage 
a significant majority of our operating revenue is derived from investment advisory  distribution and portfolio accounting agreements with the funds and separate accounts 
under these agreements  the fees we receive are typically based on the market value of our total assets  which includes our assets under management and assets in which we provide model portfolio design and oversight 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease or by causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk 
in addition  a decline in the prices of securities may present market conditions that could preclude us from increasing our total assets and prevent us from realizing higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
we are also subject to market risk  in the form of equity price risk  due to a decline in the prices of our investments in certain investment securities  partnership investments and derivatives 
we own investment securities primarily comprised of products we manage 
the following table provides a sensitivity analysis of changes in fair value of our investment securities and partnership investments assuming a increase or decrease in the individual price of each instrument as of december  carrying value assuming in thousands carrying value increase decrease available for sale securities funds common stock cfs securities funds derivative contracts assets partnership investments partnerships in order to reduce the volatility in fair value of the calamos corporate investment portfolio  we use exchange traded option contracts as an economic hedge against price changes 
these major equity market index exchange traded option contracts are used specifically for hedging the equity price risk of our portfolio 
the derivative assets and liabilities seen on our consolidated statements of financial condition are part of a single strategy to minimize the downside risk in the hedged portfolio  while allowing participation in a portion of an appreciating market 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december  we had index exchange traded put option contracts with an aggregate market value of  a adverse change in the option carrying value would result in a decrease of  in our put option contract 
interest rate sensitivity as of december   we had an aggregate of million of outstanding debt  which consisted of senior unsecured notes of million of notes due july   million of notes due july  and million of notes due july  as these notes have fixed interest rates  we do not have any direct exposure to market interest rate risk 
other market risks due to the nature of our business  we believe that we do not face any material credit risk  inflation  interest rate or foreign currency rate risk
