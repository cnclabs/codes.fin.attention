item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
overview as discussed in item  business above  the majority of our operations are in poland  and we have devoted most of our technical talent and capital expenditures in the last several years to our operations in that country 
the decision to devote most of our available capital to this area drives our operating results and the changes to our balance sheet and liquidity 
our operations in poland  which are a combination of existing production and substantial exploration  have grown considerably 
oil and gas production  oil and gas revenues  cash flow  and oil and gas expenditures in this area have grown significantly over the last three years 
our us operations also have an impact 
our us operations are smaller than those in poland and do not present the same level of opportunities for expansion  however  our us operations are a relatively stable source of cash flow 
this  too  is reflected in our operating results 
highlights over the past three years include oil and gas revenues have almost tripled since to million in  a compound annual growth rate of per year 
total revenues have likewise increased  with a compound annual growth rate of per year during the same period 
oil and gas production has more than doubled since to bcfe in  a compound annual growth rate of 
natural gas prices in poland continue to show strength in the face of economic uncertainty 
at the time of this report  the low methane tariff in poland was higher than at year end the average gas price we received in  taking into account currency fluctuations throughout the year  was higher than the amount we received in we continue to diversify our production risk profile 
at the time of this report  we were producing gas from seven wells in poland  with three additional wells scheduled to begin production during at the end of  we were producing gas from only three wells in poland 
our exploration and development spending continues to increase 
the amounts we reported for exploration costs and capital additions for  which represent a record level of activity for us  were triple our spending 
since  we have been designated to act as the operator for the permitting  designing  and construction of all new production facilities in poland 
notwithstanding our positive results  we continue to face challenges operating in a foreign country with a different economic system and culture  including a new hydrocarbon law  which  if enacted as proposed  would increase the royalties and taxes we pay in poland  delays such as those associated with the commencement of production from our winna gora and ksk wells  which prevented higher production and revenue gains during and  the pace at which pgnig  our operating partner in the fences concession  wishes to proceed or the extent to which pgnig wishes to participate as a non operating partner in other concessions  operating practices that differ from customary practices in the united states  which generally result in higher capital costs in poland  longer lead times to drilling  first production  and lower initial production rates  obtaining better success ratios in our exploration efforts outside of our core fences area  and volatile noncash adjustments for foreign currency fluctuations that continue to affect our net income in an unpredictable fashion 
there are two other factors that affect our results of operations that  though not unique to us  are different from what united states investors typically see when comparing us with most domestic  small capitalization independent producers the different pricing model for our polish gas production  and the functional currency for our largest subsidiary  fx energy poland  which is the polish zloty  not the us dollar 
commodity prices global oil prices continued to be volatile in gas prices in the united states remained at depressed levels  which have persisted since however  the polish gas market operates quite differently than the us domestic market 
in poland  substantially all of our gas production is sold to pgnig and is tied to published tariffs wholesale prices set from time to time by the public utility regulator for gas sold to wholesale consumers 
at the time of this report  the low methane tariff  which is the basis for all of our gas contracts in poland  is higher than it was at the end of a major component of the gas tariff calculation is the cost of russian imported gas  which is priced based predominantly on trailing oil prices 
thus  world oil prices can have a significant impact on polish gas prices 
other major components of the tariff calculation include the cost of gas provided by pgnig itself  as well as the necessity for pgnig to cover its internal cost structure 
natural gas prices in poland are  and for years have been  below european union average prices for both households and industry  because the prices have been subsidized by the government 
european union rules require poland to gradually abandon market subsidies and bring polish gas prices to western europe free market levels 
poland continues to enjoy the strongest economy in the european union and was the only country in europe to record positive gdp growth every year from through while the economy is expected to slow somewhat  economists are still predicting positive growth during these factors may act as cushions against possible declines in prices 
as of year end  gas prices in poland remained firm and were significantly higher than those of an equivalent btu content in the united states 
for example  as of the date of this report the price we receive for natural gas at our roszkow well  which has a methane content of  is approximately double the spot price under natural gas contracts for methane gas traded on the new york mercantile exchange  sometimes referred to as the henry hub price 
the volumes of our gas reserves in poland from through were not impacted by changing prices 
however  all of our oil and gas reserves can be price sensitive  and future material reductions in the prices at which we sell our oil and gas could result in the impairment of reserves 
functional currency and exchange rates the functional currency of our polish subsidiary is the polish zloty 
accounting standards require the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation 
because fx energy poland s functional currency is the polish zloty  translation adjustments result from the process of translating its financial statements into the parent company s us dollar reporting currency 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income  but are reported separately and accumulated in other comprehensive income 
the accounting basis of the assets and liabilities affected by the change is adjusted to reflect the difference between the exchange rate when the asset or liability was first recorded and the exchange rate on the date of the change 
the difference in functional currency also affects the amounts we report for our polish assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses from those that would be reported were the us dollar the functional currency for our polish operations 
the differences will depend on changes in period average and period end exchange rates 
transaction gains or losses may be significant given the volatility of the exchange rate 
we enter into various agreements in poland denominated in the polish zloty 
the exchange rate between the us dollar and the polish zloty is subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control 
during  the zloty fluctuated between a low of zlotys per us dollar to a high of zlotys per us dollar  a fluctuation of 
variations in exchange rates affect the us dollar denominated amount of revenue we report  compared to what we receive in polish zlotys 
as the us dollar strengthens relative to the zloty  our us dollar denominated revenue actually received in polish zlotys declines  conversely  when the us dollar weakens relative to the zloty  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys increases 
likewise  a weak us dollar leads to lower us dollar denominated drilling  capital  and exploration costs  while a strong us dollar has the opposite effect for the cost structure of our polish operations 
should exchange rates in effect during early continue throughout the year  we expect the exchange rates to have a slightly positive impact on our us dollar denominated revenues  and a slightly negative impact on our dollar denominated costs  compared to in addition  the change in the exchange rate from the end of each reporting period to the next has an impact on foreign exchange gains and losses 
at the end of  the exchange rate was zlotys per us dollar compared to zlotys per us dollar at the end of this year end to year end appreciation of the zloty represents a decrease in the amount of polish currency required to satisfy outstanding us dollar denominated intercompany and other loans of fx energy poland as of december   and creates the noncash foreign exchange gain recorded on our consolidated statements of operations 
more information concerning the impact of foreign currency transactions can be found in the discussion that follows  as well as in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
proposed changes to poland s hydrocarbon legislation in late  the polish government approved guidelines for new hydrocarbon legislation  including  among other things  higher royalties on hydrocarbons produced  a new cash flow tax based on the positive cumulative cash flow from exploration and development projects  as well as changes to how usufruct fees are determined and how concessions are awarded 
the minister of environment has been directed to prepare a draft law  which was published in early comments from the industry general public will be invited  and either taken into account or not in preparing a revised draft by the minister 
the revised draft will be subject to review by various governmental committees and agencies  and then a final draft will be subject to approval by the government  before it is sent to the parliament 
the new legislation is meant to increase governmental revenue from the oil and gas industry  with the stated intention for the total royalty and tax burden of an energy company to approach of taxable income  which is approximately double that of the current fiscal regime 
the new law  once approved by parliament  would become effective january   at the earliest  but in any event not prior to the first commercial production of shale gas in the country 
the new royalty and tax structure would be applicable to all production  without regard to when the well was drilled or the relevant concession granted 
although the draft law was recently published  we are unable to estimate the impact of the law on our financial results or operations 
however  any increase in royalties or income taxes to which we may be subject would have an adverse impact 
results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production  or e p  segment in poland and the united states  and the oilfield services segment in the united states 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
dd a  g a  amortization of deferred compensation  interest income  other income  interest expense  and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed fully following the segment discussion

see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail concerning our segment results 
exploration and production segment gas revenues 
revenues from gas sales were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
our gas revenues increased million from levels by approximately million due to higher gas prices  coupled with approximately million related to higher annual production 
gas revenues in increased million from levels by approximately million due to higher gas prices  coupled with approximately million related to higher annual production 
company wide net gas production increased from a daily rate in of approximately mmcfd to a record rate of approximately mmcfd in  an increase of 
in early february  gas was flowing in poland at an average rate of mmcfd  net to our interest 
in addition to our increased production  higher gas prices  which were partially offset by negative currency changes  resulted in higher gas revenues during the polish low methane tariff  which serves as the reference price for our gas sales agreements  averaged higher during the full year of compared to the increase was primarily a function of a increase that became effective for us on april  this increase was preceded by a increase that became effective for us on august  however  the increase in prices was partially offset by the effect of currency changes from year to year 
strength in the us dollar against the polish zloty decreased our us dollar denominated gas prices 
the average exchange rate during was zlotys per us dollar 
the average exchange rate during was zlotys per us dollar  a change of approximately 
the primary driver of our increased production in was the full resolution of a pipeline bottleneck during the second quarter of  following which the ksk wells were placed on full production 
gas production at our three ksk wells averaged mmcfd during  compared to mmcfd during at year end  the wells were producing at a combined rate of mmcfd 
gas at ksk is being sold to pgnig at a contracted rate equal to of the published low methane tariff 
we have a interest in the ksk wells 
gas production at our roszkow well averaged mmcfd during  compared to mmcfd during at year end  the well was producing at a rate of mmcfd 
gas at roszkow is being sold to pgnig at a contracted rate equal to of the published low methane tariff 
we have a interest in the roszkow well 
gas production at our zaniemysl well averaged mmcfd during  compared to mmcfd during at year end  the well was producing at a rate of mmcfd 
gas at zaniemysl is being sold to pgnig at a contracted rate equal to of the published low methane tariff 
we have a interest in the zaniemysl well 
gas production began at our winna gora well in january of at the time of this report  the well was producing approximately mmcfd mmcfd net to our interest 
gas at winna gora is being sold to pgnig at a contracted rate equal to of the published low methane tariff 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for gas revenues  average gas prices  gas production volumes  and lifting costs per mcf for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per mcf percent change versus prior year production volumes mcf percent change versus prior year lifting costs per mcf percent change versus prior year lifting costs per mcf are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total volume of gas produced 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
lower average oil prices in compared to combined with lower production to cause the decrease in revenues 
our average oil price during was per barrel  a decrease compared to per barrel received during production from our us properties declined by due to normal production declines 
us oil revenues in decreased from levels by approximately 
million due to lower oil prices  combined with approximately million related to production declines 
us oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately million related to production declines 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil revenues  average oil prices  oil production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per bbl percent change versus prior year production volumes bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
light crude oil lifting costs in poland are based on an allocation of total costs based on relative revenues between oil and gas 
lifting costs include production taxes incurred in the united states 
costs in include approximately million associated with the cleanup of a minor oil leak 
excluding the cleanup costs  lifting costs per barrel in would have equaled approximately per barrel 
lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in  million in  and million in operating costs in the united states decreased in by approximately million over costs  due to million spent during to remediate a small oil leak in montana along with higher workover costs incurred on our existing producing wells during that year 
operating costs in poland increased in from levels 
most operating costs in poland arise from fixed costs at our production facilities  fees paid to the operator of our production facilities increased year over year 
exploration costs 
exploration expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs as well as the costs of exploratory dry holes 
exploration costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in was a function of increased dry hole costs  offset by lower geological and geophysical costs 
geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during all three years  most of our g g costs were spent on acquiring  processing  and interpreting new d and d seismic data in the fences area and in our other concession areas in poland 
exploratory dry hole costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our dry hole costs were associated primarily with our kutno well in poland 
the kutno well  which was the deepest well ever drilled in poland  was found to be noncommercial during the third quarter of under the terms of a farmout agreement  our partner agreed to pay of the costs of the well 
total costs to us were approximately million 
our dry hole costs were associated with our machnatka well 
under the terms of a joint operating agreement  our partner agreed to pay of the costs of the well to a depth of  meters 
after reaching that depth  we agreed to pay of the costs and continue drilling to a depth of approximately  meters 
during  recompletion attempts failed to establish commercial production at our zakowo project in poland 
impairment costs 
impairments of oil and gas properties were million   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we impaired the cost of certain concessions in poland  in the amount of million  due to our determination that they were not prospective for hydrocarbon accumulation 
also during  we impaired all capitalized costs associated with our alberta bakken project in montana  which included million in drilling costs incurred during and million in leasehold costs 
we have no plans to pursue this project in the near future 
during  we dropped a small amount of non prospective acreage near our kutno project and impaired the associated undeveloped leasehold costs 
asset retirement obligation 
we recorded gains associated with future asset retirement obligations of   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
when the present value of a future asset retirement obligation changes due to the increase or decrease of the estimated plugging costs of that asset  we adjust the related asset retirement cost 
during and  the economic lives of our united states oil wells were increased  as higher oil prices resulted in more economic barrels 
this change resulted in a decrease in the net present value of the retirement obligations  which in turn resulted in gains associated with those obligations  as the related asset retirement costs had been previously written off due to property impairments 
dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase from to is a combination of higher dd a expenses due to increased production at our ksk wells  along with higher dd a expenses resulting from negative revisions in proved reserves at our ksk and zaniemysl wells  which are discussed below 
the increase from to was primarily a function of our increased production in poland 
future dd a costs are expected to generally  but not completely  follow future production trends 
however  future dd a rates can be very different depending upon future capitalized costs and changes in reserve volumes 
accretion expense 
accretion expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accretion expense is related entirely to our asset retirement obligation associated with expected future plugging and abandonment costs 
oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we drilled five wells for third parties  including one drilled for our alberta bakken joint venture  during  along with additional well service work 
we drilled eight wells for third parties  including those drilled for our alberta bakken joint venture  during  along with additional well service work 
we drilled wells for third parties during  however  most of these were shallow wells  which can be drilled in only two to three days and generate less revenue per well than deeper wells 
oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
we cannot accurately predict future oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  or   and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
the changes in services costs from year to year were primarily due to the nature of our drilling activity discussed above 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are closely associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we spent million  million  and million on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during   and  respectively 
these capital additions resulted in higher dd a expenses for this segment during and nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
increased costs in associated with higher headcount in poland were offset by lower legal and other fees in the united states 
our g a costs rose from levels primarily due to higher legal and investor relations related costs 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock and stock options granted to employees in    and stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock and stock options granted to employees in    and stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in    and interest and other income expense corporate 
interest and other income expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we incurred million in interest expense  which included million of amortization of loan fees and million in unused commitment fees 
interest and other income was million during during  we incurred million in interest expense  which included million of amortization of loan fees and million in unused commitment fees 
interest and other income was million during included in the amount was interest income of approximately  offset by a charge of approximately  associated with the impairment of some obsolete inventory in the united states 
during  we incurred million in interest expense  which included million of previously unamortized loan fees associated with our prior credit facility  million of amortization of loan fees  and million in unused commitment fees 
interest and other income was  during included in the amount was a gain of approximately million attributable to the sale of tubing associated with our grundy well  which was drilled and abandoned during foreign exchange 
we incurred foreign exchange gains of million for the year ended december   and foreign exchange losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes 
we reported net income of million for the year ended december   and net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no income tax expense was recognized for due to the reversal of valuation allowances that offset income tax expense for the period 
accounting standards require that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
proved reserves oil and gas reserves reserve volumes decreased at year end due primarily to negative revisions at our ksk and zaniemysl wells due to declining well head pressures  along with negative revisions in the united states due to lower oil prices 
positive reserve revisions at our roszkow  winna gora  and lisewo wells due to more favorable technical data  along with new reserves at our komorze k well which was completed during the year  partially offset our record gas production and the negative revisions 
the following table highlights year end reserve volumes and values and shows the change from to change in thousands proved reserve volumes gas reserves mcf oil reserves bbls total reserves mcfe proved reserve values reserves pv value changes in proved reserves were as follows mmcfe proved reserves beginning of year extensions  discoveries  and other additions revisions of previous estimates production proved reserves end of year extensions  discoveries  and other additions 
all of the additions to proved reserves that result from the discovery of new fields are associated with our komorze k well  which was completed for production during revisions 
revisions represent changes in previous reserves estimates  either positive revisions upward or negative revisions downward  resulting from new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in economic factors  such as commodity prices  operating costs  or development costs 
during  excluding the volume reduction due to annual production  we recorded downward revisions at our zaniemysl and ksk wells due to  respectively  water influx and lower than expected wellhead pressures obtained during the fourth quarter of the year 
these were partially offset by upward reserve revisions at our roszkow  lisewo  and winna gora wells  where new pressure data indicates that the initial gas in place for these wells may be more than estimated at year end we also recorded upward revisions of approximately  barrels of oil in the united states  primarily due to lower operating costs resulting in more economically recoverable barrels 
during  excluding the reduction due to annual production  we recorded upward reserve revisions at our roszkow and winna gora wells  which were offset by small downward revisions at our zaniemysl and ksk wells 
at roszkow  new pressure data indicates that the initial gas in place may be more than estimated at year end we also recorded upward revisions of approximately  barrels of oil in the united states  primarily due to higher oil prices resulting in more economically recoverable barrels 
revisions at year end included downward revisions in poland due to interpretations of reservoir pressure data at our roszkow well  while upward revisions occurred in the united states due to higher oil prices 
see items and  business and properties 
production 
see gas revenues and oil revenues above 
operational trends we currently expect that our production will be higher than our production rates with the addition of production at our winna gora  lisewo  and komorze k wells 
production began at winna gora in late january of production is expected to begin at lisewo and at komorze k during the second half of we currently expect to receive of the published low methane tariff  adjusted for energy content  for each of the three new wells 
the amount of revenue from this increased production will depend on applicable gas sales prices and prevailing currency exchange rates 
future oil revenues from our domestic production will depend on the impact of prices we receive as we continue to experience normal production declines 
we cannot accurately predict future oilfield services revenues and related costs  which will continue to fluctuate based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the nature and extent of any equipment upgrading  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
costs that vary in concert with production  such as lease operating expenses and dd a costs  will trend up or down with production increases or decreases 
our plans for capital expenditures are detailed in the following section  liquidity and capital resources our capital resources and future expenditures 
our us dollar denominated financial results will continue to be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations  which cannot be predicted 
liquidity and capital resources for much of our history  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  bank borrowings  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
however  as our oil and gas production has increased in poland in the last several years and as higher oil prices have improved the profitability of our us production  our internally generated cash flow has become a significant source of operations financing 
liquidity and capital working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   a decrease of million from december  the primary causes of the decrease are our increased exploration costs in and the classification of million as a current portion of our long term debt 
at the time of this report  we are in the process of extending and expanding our credit facility 
if we do not complete a new credit facility  we will be required to make a million principal payment under the terms of our existing facility on december  our current assets at year end included approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in accrued oil and gas sales from both the united states and poland  and million in receivables from our joint interest partners in both the united states and poland that were collected in early almost the entire balance of joint interest receivables at year end was due from pgnig  primarily related to the drilling of our kutno well  where we act at the operator 
our current liabilities at year end included approximately million payable by fx poland for various drilling and development operations in poland that were paid in early operating activities 
net cash used in operations during and was million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities during was million 
a million increase in exploration costs offset higher revenues in  leading to a decline in cash provided from operating activities in likewise  a million increase in exploration costs in offset higher revenues 
investing activities 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  we spent million for oil and gas property additions  all of which was related to our polish drilling activities 
we also spent million adding to our oilfield services and office equipment 
in  we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which were related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we spent million adding to our oilfield services equipment 
we also benefited from approximately million spent in the warsaw south project area by pgnig for seismic and drilling costs in in order to earn a interest in the concession 
in  we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which were related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent million adding to our oilfield services equipment 
financing activities 
our cash flow from financing activities was and million  during and  respectively 
during  we issued million shares of common stock in a registered public offering  which resulted in net proceeds to us  after offering costs  of approximately million 
we used million of those proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility at the time of the offering 
we borrowed million under our credit facility in the fourth quarter of we also received proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
during  we borrowed million under our expanded credit facility  using million to repay our credit facility and million in fees associated with the expanded credit facility 
in addition  we sold million shares of stock in a registered direct offering  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
option holders exercised options to purchase  shares of common stock  resulting in proceeds to us of an additional million 
there were no financing transactions during our capital resources and future expenditures our anticipated sources of liquidity and capital for include our working capital of million at year end  available credit under our expanded credit facility  and cash available from our operations 
in august  we refinanced our existing credit facility by executing an expanded credit facility with the royal bank of scotland plc  ing bank nv  and kbc bank nv 
the expanded credit facility calls for a periodic interest rate of libor plus and has a term of five years  with semiannual borrowing base reductions of million each beginning on june  as of december   we had million outstanding under the facility  and million of available credit 
our borrowing base is scheduled to be reduced to million on june  we currently have increased cash from our operating activities to help fund our exploration and development activities in we expect that our production will be higher than our production with the addition of production at our winna gora  lisewo  and komorze k wells 
production began at winna gora in late january of production is expected to begin at lisewo and at komorze k during the second half of we currently expect to receive of the published low methane tariff  adjusted for energy content  for each of the three new wells 
the amount of revenue from this increased production will depend on applicable gas sales prices and prevailing currency exchange rates 
we have an effective securities act universal shelf registration statement under which we may sell up to million of equity or debt securities of various kinds 
in june  we entered into an agreement to possibly sell up to million in common stock during the next two years in at the market transactions 
through the date of this filing  we have not sold any stock under that agreement 
assuming all million of common stock covered by the at the market facility were sold  the remaining million balance of securities available for sale under the registration statement is available for sale at any time  subject to market conditions and our ability to access the capital markets  to further finance our exploration and development plans in poland and for other corporate purposes 
at year end  we were in the process of drilling the tuchola well  having incurred a total cost of million during the year 
we began drilling the mieczewo well in early our total costs for these wells once drilling is completed are expected to be approximately million 
we have agreed with pgnig to conduct a fracture stimulation test at the plawce well during the first half of we were also in the process of building a pipeline and production facilities at our lisewo well 
we had no other firm commitments for future capital and exploration costs at year end 
we expect our primary use of cash for will be for our exploration and development activities in poland and the united states 
our board of directors has approved projects whose cost is expected to range from million to million for production facilities for existing discoveries  exploration and development wells  and d and d seismic data acquisition and analysis  including those items noted above 
all of the approved projects may not be completed during  but we do expect to start work on all of them in the next months 
in  we approved a capital budget of similar size 
our actual costs in were million  but by early january of  we had started work on projects totaling million originally scheduled for the actual amount of our expenditures will depend on ongoing exploration results  the pace at which pgnig  our operating partner in the fences project area  wishes to proceed or the extent it wishes to continue to participate with us in concessions we operate  the availability of drilling and other exploration services  and the amount of capital we obtain from the various sources discussed above 
our various sources of liquidity and capital outlined above should more than enable us to meet our capital needs in poland and the united states for the next months 
we have the ability to control the timing and amount of most of our future capital and exploration costs 
we may continue to incur operating losses in future periods  and we continue to fund substantial exploration and development in poland 
we have a history of operating losses 
from our inception in january through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
despite our recent and expected future increases in production and revenues  our exploration and production activities may continue to result in net losses in future years  depending on the success of our drilling activities in poland and the united states and whether we generate sufficient revenues to cover related operating expenses 
we may also seek to obtain additional funds for future capital investments from the sale of partial property interests or arrangements such as those negotiated in prior years for our kutno and warsaw south project areas in which industry participants are bearing the initial exploration costs to earn an interest in the project or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we will allocate our existing capital  as well as funds we may obtain in the future  among our various projects at our discretion 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition  and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments contractual obligations 
at december   the aggregate amounts of our contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows total in thousands credit facility interest payments on long term debt total under the terms of our million credit facility  the amount of credit available is reduced by million each six months  beginning on june  as of december   we had borrowed million under the facility  and the reduction of that amount is illustrated in the table above 
during the ordinary course of business in poland  we enter into agreements for the drilling of wells  the construction of production facilities  and for seismic projects 
these are typically short term agreements and are completed in less than one year 
we are subject to certain work commitments respecting our owned exploration concessions that must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
these work commitments are optional on our part  however  they must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
we can request changes to usufruct and concession agreements that either modify the obligations to reduce our commitments or extend the terms of those agreements 
in addition  we routinely relinquish acreage that we believe has lower potential rather than continue to be subject to the related work commitment 
our exploration budget and related activities are focused on exploration and long term exploitation of our most promising exploration opportunities and are not specifically or primarily focused on meeting these work commitments 
our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage  suspension of operations  personal injury  and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states and poland operations and also rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration partners in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling  and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
asset retirement obligation 
we have liabilities of million related to asset retirement obligations on our consolidated balance sheet at december   excluded from the table above 
due to the nature of these obligations  we cannot determine precisely when the payments will be made to settle these obligations 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new standards that require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the new standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after january  we are currently evaluating the provisions of the new standards and assessing the impact  if any  it may have on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued amended standards that eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity and require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income as either one continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the amended standards do not affect the reported amounts of comprehensive income 
in december   the fasb deferred the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement that had previously been included in the june amended standard 
these amended standards are to be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted these standards on january  in may  the fasb issued amended standards to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosures between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the standards include amendments that clarify the intent behind the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosures and other amendments that change principles or requirements for fair value measurements or disclosures 
the amended standards are to be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted these standards on january  in january  the fasb issued new standards intended to improve disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new standards require details of transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the gross presentation of activity within the level fair value measurement roll forward 
the new disclosures are required of all entities that are required to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
we adopted these new rules effective january   except for the gross presentation of the level fair value measurement roll forward  which we adopted december  in all cases referenced above  the adoption of the new rules or standards did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that net capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not considered to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
gains and losses are recognized on sales of entire interests in proved and unproved properties 
sales of partial interests are generally treated as a recovery of costs and any resulting gain or loss is recorded as other income 
revenues associated with oil and gas sales are recorded when title passes  which is upon delivery to the pipeline or purchaser  and are net of royalties 
oilfield service revenues are recognized when the related service is performed 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
oil and gas reserves all of the reserves data in this form k are estimates 
estimates of our crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by our engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserves estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  economic producibility of reserves is dependent on the oil and gas prices used in the reserves estimate 
we based our december   reserves estimates on a month average commodity price  unless contractual arrangements designated the price to be used  in accordance with securities and exchange commission rules 
however  oil and gas prices are volatile and  as a result  our reserves estimates will change in the future 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect our dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also cause us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge  which would reduce earnings
