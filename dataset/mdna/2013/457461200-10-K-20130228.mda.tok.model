enhanced our liquidity by issuing preferred stock and increasing the size of our unsecured line of credit facility 
improved our ebitda  adjusted interest expense coverage ratio from times to times 
goals and objectives continue to enhance the value of our portfolio through additional repositioning and redevelopment initiatives 
redeploy capital from dispositions of non core  limited growth assets into acquisitions of high quality retail assets at better than market rates 
continue to reduce the cost and extend the term of our debt and reduce our overall leverage over time  which will improve our financial flexibility and liquidity by maintaining access to multiple sources of capital 

table of contents as part of our growth strategy  management implemented external growth initiatives consisting of unconsolidated joint venture activities 
as a result of these activities being unconsolidated  we are not able to present a complete picture of the impact these ventures have on our consolidated financial statements 
we have included pro rata consolidated financial statements in the non gaap financial measures section of this annual report on form k to present our consolidated financial statements including our share of the joint venture balance sheets and statements of operations 
including the accounts of our unconsolidated joint ventures at percent  we managed approximately  in total assets as of december  and earned  in total revenues 
we believe providing this information allows investors to better compare our overall performance and operating metrics to those of other reits in our peer group 
ongoing strategies and objectives current strategies our primary business objective is to enhance the performance and value of our investment properties through management strategies that address the needs of an evolving retail marketplace 
our success in operating our centers efficiently and effectively is  we believe  a direct result of our expertise in the acquisition  management  leasing and development re development  either directly or through a joint venture  of our properties 
acquisition strategies we seek to selectively acquire well located open air retail centers that meet our investment criteria 
we will  from time to time  acquire properties either without financing contingencies or by assuming existing debt to provide us with a competitive advantage over other potential purchasers requiring financing or financing contingencies 
additionally  we concentrate our property acquisitions in areas where we have a large market concentration 
in doing this  we believe we are able to attract new retailers to the area and possibly lease several locations to them 
joint ventures we have formed joint ventures to acquire stabilized retail properties as well as properties to be redeveloped and vacant land to be developed 
we structure these ventures to earn fees from the joint ventures for providing property management  asset management  acquisition and leasing services 
we will continue to receive management and leasing fees for those investment properties under management  however  acquisition fees may decrease as we acquire fewer investment properties through these ventures 
additionally  we have formed a joint venture to acquire properties that are ultimately sold to investors through a private offering of tenant in common tic interests or interests in delaware statutory trusts dst 
we earn fees from the joint venture for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
we will continue to receive management and leasing fees for those properties under management  even after all of the tic or dst interests have been sold 
we believe that joint ventures support our strategic goals of expanding our footprint to improve diversification  utilizing attractively priced capital and preserving our balance sheet 
additionally  the joint ventures provide us with ongoing fee income which enhances our results of operations from our core portfolio 
operations we actively manage costs to minimize operating expenses by centralizing all management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting and data processing activities to provide operating efficiencies 
we seek to improve rental income and cash flow by aggressively marketing rentable space 
we emphasize regular maintenance and periodic renovation to meet the needs of tenants and to maximize long term returns 
we maintain a diversified tenant base consisting primarily of retail tenants providing consumer goods and services 
we proactively review our existing portfolio for potential re development opportunities 
liquidity and capital resources our most liquid asset is cash and cash equivalents  which includes cash and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were  and  respectively 
the higher cash balance at december   reflects sales activity in our joint venture with ipcc at year end  the proceeds of which were subsequently used to pay down the balance on our unsecured line of credit facility  higher prepaid rents and cash received from the sale of certain investment 
table of contents securities which was not reinvested 
see our discussion of the statements of cash flows for a description of our cash activity during the years ended december   and we consider all demand deposits  money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less  at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions 
the combined account balances at one or more institutions could periodically exceed the federal depository insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage and  as a result  there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposits in excess of fdic insurance coverage 
however  we do not believe the risk is significant based on our review of the rating of the institutions where our cash is deposited 
fdic insurance currently covers up to  per depositor at each insured bank 
sources of cash income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
other sources of cash include amounts raised from the sale of securities  including shares of our common stock sold under our drp and ongoing atm issuance program  draws on our unsecured line of credit facility  which may be limited due to covenant compliance requirements  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties  cash flows we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders and fee income received from our unconsolidated joint venture properties 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants applicable to us 
we had up to  available under our  line of credit facility and an additional  available under an accordion feature 
the access to the accordion feature requires approval of the lending group 
if approved  the terms for the funds borrowed under the accordion feature would be current market terms and not the terms of the other borrowings under the line of credit facility 
the lending group is not obligated to approve access to funds under the accordion feature 
we use our cash primarily to pay distributions to our stockholders  for operating expenses at our investment properties  for interest expense on our debt obligations  for purchasing additional investment properties and capital commitments at existing investment properties  to meet joint venture commitments  to repay draws on the line of credit facility and for retiring mortgages payable 
in the aggregate  our investment properties are currently generating sufficient cash flow to pay our operating expenses  monthly debt service requirements  certain capital expenditures and current distributions 
monthly debt service requirements consist primarily of interest payments on our debt obligations although certain of our secured mortgages require monthly principal amortization 
we also own marketable securities of other entities  including reits 
these investments are generally liquid and could be sold to generate liquidity 
these investments in available for sale securities totaled  at december   consisting of preferred and common stock investments 
at december   we had recorded an accumulated net unrealized gain of on these investment securities 
realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities are specifically identified and determined 
during the years ended december   and  we realized gains on sale of   and  respectively 
we also fund certain of our liquidity needs through the sale of our common stock in at the market or atm issuances 
we may issue up to  of our shares of common stock through the atm issuances 
bmo capital markets corp  jefferies company  inc and keybanc capital markets  inc together the agents act as our sales agent s for these issuances which may be made in privately negotiated transactions if we and the agents have so agreed in writing or by any other method deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule under the securities act  including sales made directly on the new york stock exchange or to or through a market maker 
we refer to the arrangement with the agents in this report on form k as our atm issuance program 
as of december   we had issued an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock through the atm issuance program generating net proceeds of approximately  comprised of approximately  in gross proceeds  offset by approximately in commissions and fees 
we used the proceeds from shares issued through the program for general corporate purposes  which included repayment of mortgage indebtedness secured by our properties  acquiring real property through wholly owned subsidiaries or through our investment in one or more joint venture entities and repaying amounts outstanding on our unsecured line of credit facility  among other things 
subsequent to december   we issued approximately shares of our common stock through the atm issuance program  generating net proceeds of approximately  comprised of approximately  in gross proceeds  offset by approximately in commissions and fees 
in october  we issued  shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock series a preferred stock at a public offering price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount but before expenses 
the proceeds were initially used to pay down debt to capture interest expense savings until the funds were drawn from our unsecured line of credit facility and used to acquire investment properties 

table of contents in february  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock at a public offering price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately  after deducting the underwriting discount  but before expenses 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to purchase additional investment properties 
as of december   we had no cumulative preferred stock dividends in arrears 
uses of cash our largest expenses relate to the operation of our properties as well as the interest expense on our mortgages payable and other debt obligations 
our property operating expenses include  but are not limited to  real estate taxes  regular maintenance  landscaping  snow removal and periodic renovations to meet tenant needs 
pursuant to lease arrangements  most tenants are required to reimburse us for some or all of their pro rata share of the real estate taxes and operating expenses of the property 
since the most recent economic downturn  we have been successful in restoring stability to our portfolio 
the stability of our portfolio  the lack of new supply of retail space  and the continued demand from growing retailers has put us in excellent position to be proactive in upgrading the quality of our tenancy and increasing rents 
we continue to focus on leasing vacant spaces  but we are also focusing on right sizing certain retailers and repositioning other centers to manage tenant exposures and open up space to accommodate larger tenants 
these activities may require us to take tenants off line during construction which may have a temporary adverse effect on our results of operations during the period the tenant is not paying rent 
we are proactive in moving forward with these activities as we believe the long term benefits outweigh the temporary decline in cash flows and net operating income 
in  we intend to expand our program to re position select centers in our portfolio to accommodate in demand retail concepts and increase asset value 
we currently have several projects underway and others under consideration 
we expect to take approximately  square feet out of service in conjunction with planned repositioning projects  which we expect to come back on line in the loss in revenue from taking this space off line will be partially offset by revenue coming on line for leases signed during during  we invested approximately  in capital for tenant improvements and leasing commission on new leases and building improvements related to some of these repositioning efforts 
we funded these improvements using cash from operations and draws on our unsecured line of credit facility 
we expect to invest approximately the same amount in using the same sources of cash 
reference is made to the total debt maturity schedule in note  secured and unsecured debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our total debt outstanding as of december   which is incorporated into this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
approximately  of consolidated debt  including required monthly principal amortization  matures prior to the end of included in this debt maturing in is approximately  related to our algonquin commons property 
although these loans do not mature until november  we have included them in because the lender has accelerated the due date of the loans in connection with their decision to initiate foreclosure proceedings 
we intend to repay the remaining maturing debt upon maturity using available cash and or borrowings under our unsecured line of credit facility 
in june  we ceased paying the monthly debt service on the mortgage loans encumbering algonquin commons 
we had hoped to reach an agreement with the special servicer that would have revised the loan structure to make continued ownership of the property economically feasible 
in january  we received notice that a complaint had been filed by the successors to the lender  alleging events of default under the loan documents and  among other things  seeking to foreclose on the property 
we cannot currently estimate the impact the dispute will have on our consolidated financial statements and may not be able to do so until a final outcome has been reached 
we believe the payment guaranty has  however  ceased and is of no further force and effect as a result of the property having met the performance metrics set forth in the payment guaranty 
as we have previously disclosed  if we are required to pay the full  outstanding under the guarantee  then making that payment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the period and the year in which it would be made and it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the period and the year in which the company culminates the disposal of the property and related debt 
we believe that this payment would not have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets 
if we are required to pay under the payment guarantee  we expect to be able to fund this payment using available cash and or a draw on our unsecured line of credit facility 
in october  we entered into a first amendment the amendment to the limited partnership agreement of our joint venture with pggm 
subject to the terms and conditions of the amendment  the partners increased the potential maximum equity contributions to allow for the acquisition of up to an additional  of grocery anchored and community retail centers located in midwestern us markets  using partner equity and secured debt 
the amendment increases our potential maximum equity commitment from approximately  to  pggm potential maximum equity commitment 
table of contents has been increased from approximately  to  the amendment allows for a two year investment period and no contributions are required unless and until both partners approve an additional acquisition 
we will fund our equity commitment with draws on our line of credit facility  proceeds from sales of investment properties  proceeds from financing unencumbered properties or the sale of preferred and or common stock

d interest expense on the line of credit facility was calculated using the outstanding balance and the percent interest rate in effect at december  critical accounting policies general 
a critical accounting policy is one that  we believe  would materially affect our operating results or financial condition  and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to the recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries  allocation and valuation of investment properties  consolidation equity accounting policies and our investments in securities 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
us gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles  methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates 
the following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends  events or uncertainties that were taken into consideration upon the application of critical accounting policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions 
recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries 
under us gaap  we are required to recognize rental income based on the effective monthly rent for each lease 
the effective monthly rent is equal to the average monthly rent during the term of the lease  not the stated rent for any particular month 
the process  known as straight lining rent  generally has the effect of increasing rental revenues during the early phases of a lease and decreasing rental revenues in the latter phases of a lease 
if rental income calculated on a straight line basis exceeds the cash rent due under the lease  the difference is recorded as an increase to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if the cash rent due under the lease exceeds rental income calculated on a straight line basis  the difference is recorded as a decrease to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we defer recognition of contingent rental income  such as percentage excess rent  until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved 
we periodically review the collectability of outstanding receivables 
allowances are taken for those balances that we have reason to believe will be uncollectible  including any amounts relating to straight line rent receivables 
amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off 
tenant recoveries are primarily comprised of real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursement income 
real estate tax income is based on an accrual reimbursement calculated by tenant  based on an estimate of current year real estate taxes 

table of contents as actual real estate tax bills are received  we reconcile with our tenants and adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
common area maintenance income is accrued on actual common area maintenance expenses as incurred 
annually  we reconcile with the tenants for their share of the expenses per their lease and we adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
allocation of investment properties 
we allocate the purchase price of each acquired investment property between land  building and improvements  other intangibles including acquired above market leases  acquired below market leases  customer relationships and acquired in place leases and any liabilities assumed  including debt that is recorded at fair value  taking into consideration any above or below market terms 
purchase price allocations are based on our estimates 
the value allocated to land as opposed to building affects the amount of depreciation expense we record 
if more value is attributed to land  depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to building and improvements 
in some circumstances we engage independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations  however  we are ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocation 
we determine whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties 
we expense acquisition costs for investment property acquisitions  accounted for as business combinations  to record the acquisition at its fair value 
the aggregate value of other intangibles is measured based on the difference between the purchase price and the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize information contained in independent appraisals and management s estimates to determine the respective as if vacant property values 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases and the risk adjusted cost of capital 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  up to months 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expenses 
we allocate the difference between the purchase price of the property and the as if vacant value first to acquired above and below market leases 
we evaluate each acquired lease based upon current market rates at the acquisition date and consider various factors including geographic location  size and location of leased space within the investment property  tenant profile and the credit risk of the tenant in determining whether the acquired lease is above or below market 
after an acquired lease is determined to be above or below market  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to the acquired above or below market lease based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease rate and the estimated market rate 
for below market leases with fixed rate renewals  renewal periods are included in the calculation of below market lease values and the amortization period 
the determination of the discount rate used in the present value calculation is based upon a rate for each individual lease and primarily based upon the credit worthiness of each individual tenant 
the values of the acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the life of each respective lease as an adjustment to rental income 
we then allocate the remaining difference to the value of acquired in place leases and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of specific leases and our overall relationship with the respective tenants 
the evaluation of acquired in place leases consists of a variety of components including the costs avoided associated with originating the acquired in place lease  including but not limited to  leasing commissions  tenant improvement costs and legal costs 
we also consider the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs and rental income estimated to be incurred during the assumed re leasing period 
the value of the acquired in place lease is amortized over the life of the related lease for each property as a component of amortization expense 
we also consider whether any customer relationship value exists related to the property acquisition 
as of december   we had not allocated any amounts to customer relationships 
the valuation and possible subsequent impairment in the value of our investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s continuous process of analyzing each property 
impairment of investment properties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
we assess the carrying values of our investment properties  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these investment properties may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of the investment properties is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the investment property to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
in order to review our investment properties for recoverability  we consider current market conditions  as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party appraisals  where considered necessary 
if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the investment property is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property 

table of contents we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows based on management s intent as follows i for real estate properties that we intend to hold long term  including land held for development  properties currently under development and operating buildings  recoverability is assessed based on the estimated future net rental income from operating the property  ii for real estate properties that we intend to sell  including land parcels  properties currently under development and operating buildings  recoverability is assessed based on estimated proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on future net rental income of the property and expected market capitalization rates  and iii for costs incurred related to the potential acquisition or development of a real estate property  recoverability is assessed based on the probability that the acquisition or development is likely to occur as of the measurement date 
the use of projected future cash flows is based on management s assumptions of future operations and is consistent with the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business 
however assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows  discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective 
changes in economic and operating conditions and our ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our real estate properties 
we also review our investments in unconsolidated entities 
when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity method investment  we evaluate the investment for impairment by estimating our ability to recover our investment from future expected cash flows 
if we determine the loss in value is other than temporary  we will recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value  the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss are complex and subjective processes 
use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments 
consolidation equity accounting policies 
we consolidate the operations of a joint venture if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the joint venture  which management has determined to be a variable interest entity vie in accordance with asc the primary beneficiary is the party that has a controlling financial interest in the vie  which is defined as having both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities that  when taken together  most significantly impact the vie s performance  and the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the vie that would be significant to the vie 
there are significant judgments and estimates involved in determining the primary beneficiary of a vie or the determination of who has control and influence of the entity 
when we consolidate a vie  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in instances where we are not the primary beneficiary of a vie we use the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the operations of a joint venture that qualifies as a vie are not consolidated with our operations 
instead our share of operations is reflected as equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
additionally  our net investment in the joint venture is reflected as investment in and advances to joint venture as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
investment in securities 
we classify our investment in securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those securities in which we have the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
investment in securities at december  and consist of perpetual preferred securities and common securities classified as available for sale securities  which are recorded at fair value and preferred securities not classified as available for sale securities and therefore  recorded at cost 
we determined that these non traded securities should be held at cost because the fair value is not readily determinable and there is no active market for these securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of comprehensive income until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary  results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
for an impaired security we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and consider whether the evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end and forecasted performance of the investee 
in addition  under the debt security model  an evaluation as to the underlying credit of the issuer is made 

table of contents statements of cash flows the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities compared to net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to an improvement in property operations 
see discussion in our results of operations section for an explanation of property operations 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in cash used in investing activities was the use of  to purchase investment properties and  in additions to investment properties during the year ended december   as compared to the use of  to purchase investment properties and  in additions to investment properties during the year ended december  additionally  we used net cash of  to fund a construction loan and to purchase notes encumbered by operating properties at a discount and invested an additional  in our unconsolidated joint ventures to acquire investment properties 
we received  in proceeds from the sale of property ownership interests in connection with our joint venture with ipcc during the year ended december   as compared to the receipt of  from the sale of property ownership interests during the year ended december  this decrease was due to the timing of the sale of property ownership interests  which typically vary from period to period and year to year 
partially offsetting this increase in cash used in investing activities was the return of capital invested in our unconsolidated joint ventures as financing was placed on certain of the investment properties and cash flow distributions from our joint ventures during the year ended december   and the receipt of  of sales proceeds from the sale of investment properties during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in cash received from financing activities was the receipt of  in loan proceeds  net of loan payoffs and  from our amended term loan during the year ended december   as compared to the receipt of  in loan proceeds  net of loan payoffs   from the new term loan   from our unsecured line of credit facility and using  to repay certain convertible notes during the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to a reduction in accounts receivable  as well as property operations 
see our discussion of results of operations for an explanation related to property operations 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in cash used in investing activities was the use of  to purchase investment properties and  in additions to investment properties during the year ended december   as compared to the use of  to purchase investment properties and  in additions to investment properties during the year ended december  additionally  we received proceeds of  from the sale of investment properties and from the change in control of investment properties during the year ended december   as compared to receiving proceeds of  from the sale of investment properties and  from the change in control of investment properties during the year ended december  partially offsetting the increase in cash used in investing activities was the receipt of  from the sale of property ownership interests in connection with our joint venture with ipcc during the year ended december   as compared to the receipt of  from the sale of property ownership interests during the year ended december  
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to cash used in financing activities of  during the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the receipt of  in proceeds from our unsecured credit facilities during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  additionally  the issuance of shares  net of offering costs of  during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  further  during the year ended december   we received  in net loan proceeds as compared to  during the year ended december  partially offsetting the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the use of  to repurchase certain convertible notes during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  results of operations this section describes and compares our results of operations for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had ownership interests in single user retail properties  neighborhood centers  community centers  power centers and lifestyle center 
we generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations 
one metric that management uses to evaluate our overall portfolio  is same store net operating income in which management analyzes the net operating income of properties that we have owned and operated for the same twelve month periods during each year 
these properties are referred to herein as same store properties 
property net operating income is a non gaap measure that allows management to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio and determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income 
we believe that net operating income is also meaningful as an indicator of the effectiveness of our management of properties because net operating income excludes certain items that are not reflective of management  such as depreciation and interest expense 
a total of of our investment properties were same store properties during the periods presented 
these properties comprise approximately million square feet 
in the table below  other investment properties includes activity from properties acquired during the years ended december   and  two properties in which we took over ownership control from our joint venture partner  properties contributed to our joint ventures and activity from properties owned through our joint venture with ipcc while these properties were consolidated 
operations from properties acquired through this joint venture are recorded as consolidated income until those properties become unconsolidated with the first sale of ownership interests to investors 
once the operations are unconsolidated  the income is included in equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the same store investment properties represented of the square footage of our consolidated portfolio at december  the following table presents the net operating income  broken out between same store and other investment properties  prior to straight line rental income  amortization of lease intangibles  interest  depreciation  amortization and bad debt expense for the years ended december   and along with reconciliation to net income loss attributable to common stockholders  calculated in accordance with us gaap

table of contents property net operating income increased  with total rental and additional rental income increasing by  and total property operating expenses increasing  in comparing the results of operations from the same store properties during the years ended december  and  property net operating income increased  with total rental and additional rental income decreasing and total property operating expenses decreasing  net income loss attributable to common stockholders increased  when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  and decreased  when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december   for the reasons explained below 
rental income rental income increased  on a same store basis  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the effect of increased income generated by new leases signed during the respective periods and the end of any associated rent abatement periods 
total rental income decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   reflecting a decrease in rental income from our other investment properties during the year 
the decrease is primarily due to the impact of contributing properties to our joint venture with pggm during and these properties become unconsolidated upon contribution to the joint venture 
this decrease is partially offset by properties acquired during these same periods 
rental income increased  on a same store basis  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the effect of increased income generated by new leases signed during the respective periods and the end of any associated rent abatement periods 
total rental income increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   reflecting an increase in rental income from our other investment properties during the year 
the increase is a result of income generated by investment properties acquired during the years ended december  and  including the change in control transaction related to the algonquin commons and orchard crossing properties and properties owned through our joint venture with ipcc  while they were consolidated 
tenant recovery income tenant recovery income increased on a same store basis  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  total tenant recovery income decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the fluctuation in tenant recovery income is a corresponding fluctuation in the amount of property operating and real estate tax expenses  both of which are recoverable under tenant leases 
the overall recovery rate year over year remained consistent 
tenant recovery income decreased  on a same store basis and  in total  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreased property operating and real estate tax expenses 
the overall recovery rate year over year also increased approximately percent 
property operating expenses property operating expenses decreased  on a same store basis and  in total  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in property operating expenses during the year is due primarily to a decrease in total snow removal costs of approximately  additionally  the decrease in total property operating expenses is a result of the contribution of properties to our joint venture with pggm during and property operating expenses decreased  on a same store basis and in total  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   respectively  primarily due to a decrease in total snow removal costs of approximately and our ongoing cost reduction efforts during the year ended december  real estate tax expense real estate tax expense increased  on a same store basis and  in total  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the change in real estate tax expense is a result of changes in the assessed values of our investment properties or the tax rates charged by the various taxing authorities 
additionally  the decrease in total real estate tax expense is a result of the contribution of properties to our joint venture with pggm during and real estate tax decreased  on a same store basis and  in total  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  primarily for the same reasons as discussed above 

table of contents other income other income increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to interest income received in the current year on our mortgages receivable and the settlement of an outstanding obligation with the prior owner of one of our investment properties 
other income decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreased gains on the sale of investment securities as a result of fewer sales during the year ended december  additionally  during the year ended december   we were granted possession of a vacant building at our orland park place outlots investment property 
previously  we had a ground lease with a restaurant operator 
upon default by the tenant  we added this building to our portfolio  according to the lease terms  resulting in income of fee income from unconsolidated joint ventures fee income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in fee income is due to a decrease in acquisition fees earned on sales of interest through our joint venture with ipcc 
acquisition fees earned may vary based on the number of properties sold  the original acquisition price of the property and the timing of the sales in each period 
this decrease was almost entirely offset by increased management fees from our unconsolidated joint ventures due to increased revenues as a result of an increased number of properties under management 
fee income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted mostly from an increase in acquisition fees earned on sales of interests by the ipcc joint venture and increased management fees related to increased revenues as a result of an increased number of properties under management through our unconsolidated joint ventures and the properties that have been fully sold through our ipcc joint venture 
gain loss from change in control of investment properties during the years ended december   and  we recorded a gain loss on the change in control of investment properties in the amount of   and  respectively 
prior to the change in control transactions  each property discussed below was unconsolidated and was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
upon consolidation  we valued these properties utilizing information obtained from third party sources and internal valuation calculations  comprised of a discounted cash flow model  using discount rates and capitalization rates applied to the expected future cash flows of the property 
we estimated the fair value of the remaining debt by discounting the future cash flows of the instrument at rates currently offered for similar debt instruments 
during the year ended december   we  on behalf of the joint venture formed to develop the property known as north aurora towne center  negotiated with the lender of the indebtedness secured by the properties to repay the mortgage payable  which matured in july  at a discount 
we contributed  to the joint venture to repay the entire  outstanding mortgage  resulting in a gain on the extinguishment of debt to us in the amount of  in conjunction with this debt repayment  the joint ventures previously established to develop these properties were dissolved  ownership of the properties was conveyed to us and the development properties and remaining indebtedness were consolidated by us 
the consolidation of these properties resulted in a loss of approximately  we recorded a net gain on change in control of  related to this transaction 
also  during the year ended december   we  on behalf of the joint venture formed to develop the property known as the shops at lakemoor  negotiated with the lender of the indebtedness secured by the property to repay the mortgage payable  which matured in october  at a discount 
the joint venture previously established to develop this property was dissolved  ownership of the property was conveyed to us and the development property and remaining indebtedness were consolidated by us

the consolidation of this property resulted in a net gain of  
table of contents gain on sale of joint venture interest gain on sale of joint venture interest decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this is due to decreased gains on sale in connection with sales of interest in properties through our joint venture with ipcc 
gains recorded may vary based on the number of properties sold  the timing of the sales in each period and the hold period of each asset 
gain on sale of joint venture interest decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the same reason as discussed above 
income tax benefit expense of taxable reit subsidiaries income tax benefit increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in the tax benefit was a decrease of  in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the decrease in this allowance was primarily due to adjustments to the beginning of the year balance of the valuation allowance because of a change in circumstances that caused a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets in future years 
our judgment changed due to the change in control transactions described above and the related fair value adjustments and gains on extinguishment of debt 
income tax benefit increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in the tax benefit was a reduced amount added to our valuation allowance during the year ended december  due to lower impairment adjustments requiring a reserve 
bad debt expense bad debt expense decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in bad debt expense is due to fewer tenant bankruptcies and tenant failures 
bad debt expense decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the same reason as discussed above 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to depreciation expense recorded on newly acquired investment properties  new tenant improvement assets for work related to new leases  additional properties owned through our joint venture with ipcc  while they were consolidated and the write off of tenant improvement assets  as a result of lease terminations 
depreciation and amortization increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to the same reasons as discussed above 
additionally  the increase is due to depreciation recorded on algonquin commons and orchard crossing after the change in control transactions 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in payroll and related items as a result of additional staff  increased legal costs related to general corporate matters and increased computer and software costs

interest expense interest expense decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately  of interest expense and the related discount amortization that we eliminated by repurchasing our convertible notes during interest expense on our mortgages payable decreased approximately  due in most part to the contribution of investment properties to our joint venture with pggm during and these decreases were partially offset by increased interest on our unsecured term loan due in most part to a full year of interest expense in for the new  term loan entered into in november interest expense increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of approximately  on our mortgages payable  which included algonquin commons for the year ended december   as compared to only six months of expense during the year ended december  and additional interest on mortgages payable of the properties owned 
table of contents through our joint venture with ipcc  while they were consolidated 
additionally  the amortization of loan costs increased related to the fees in connection with the refinance of the unsecured credit facilities in june  as well as the fees for the amendments completed during the year ended december  partially offsetting this increase in interest expense was a decrease in interest on our convertible notes as a result of the repurchases during and and decreased interest expense on our unsecured line of credit due to lower interest rates charged on the outstanding balance 
provision for asset impairment during the year ended december   we recorded a provision for asset impairment of  to record our investment in three development joint ventures at fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded a provision for asset impairment of  related to five development joint venture projects  to reflect the investments at fair value 
reference is made to our discussion under the caption critical account policies in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our impairment policies 
equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase was increased same store net operating income on the unconsolidated pool of properties and an increase of  of the amortization of basis differences associated with our unconsolidated joint ventures 
also affecting the increase were total impairment losses of  recorded during the year ended december  at the joint venture level 
our pro rata share of this loss  equal to  is included in this line item on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased  for year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   respectively 
the decline in earnings for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due to the aforementioned impairment losses recorded related to development joint venture properties

table of contents portfolio activity during the year ended december   our leasing activity remained strong and our leasing spreads were positive on both new and renewal leases in our consolidated portfolio 
during the year ended december   we executed new  renewal and non comparable leases expansion square footage or spaces for which no former tenant was in place for one year or more  aggregating approximately  square feet of our consolidated portfolio 
the new leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  a increase over the average expiring rate 
the renewal leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  an increase over the average expiring rate 
the non comparable leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average base rent of per square foot 
the calculations of former and new average base rents are adjusted for rent abatements 
for leases signed during the month period ending december   the average leasing commission was approximately per square foot  the average cost for tenant improvements was approximately per square foot and the average period given for rent concessions was three to five months 
during  leases  comprising approximately  square feet and accounting for approximately of our annualized base rent  will be expiring in our consolidated portfolio 
none of the expiring leases is deemed to be material to our financial results 
the weighted average expiring rate on these leases is per square foot 
we will continue to attempt to renew expiring leases and re lease those spaces that are vacant  or may become vacant  at more favorable rental rates to increase revenue and cash flow 
in  supervalu  inc  the largest tenant in our total portfolio including unconsolidated properties at based on percentage of annual base rent and square footage  announced its intention to explore strategic alternatives for the company  primarily the sale of all or some its assets 
in january  supervalu announced the sale of five of its brands to an investor group 
if the transaction closes  supervalu will retain ownership of the cub foods chain  in addition to others  and the investor group will become the owner of jewel osco  among others 
as of december   supervalu represented approximately of annual base rent and approximately of gross leasable area in our total portfolio 
once the transaction closes  our exposure will be split between jewel osco stores becoming of our total annual base rent and cub foods becoming of our total annual base rent 
with the considerable market share controlled by both cub foods and jewel osco in their respective markets  we believe these stores should maintain their relevance as grocery operators

table of contents consolidated joint ventures are those in which we have a controlling financial interest in the joint venture or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that has a controlling financial interest in the vie  which is defined as having both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities that  when taken together  most significantly impact the vie s performance  and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive the returns from the vie that would be significant to the vie 
the third parties interests in these consolidated entities are reflected as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
all inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation

development joint ventures our development joint ventures with four independent partners were designed to take advantage of what we believed were the unique strengths of each development team  while potentially diversifying our risk 
our development partners identified opportunities  assembled and completed the entitlement process for the land  and gauged national big box retailer interest in the location before bringing the project to us for consideration 
we contributed financing  leasing  and property management expertise to enhance the productivity of the new developments and are typically entitled to earn a preferred return on our portion of invested capital 
during the recent economic downturn  a number of retailers delayed new store openings until market conditions substantially improved 
in light of this marketplace reality  we extended delivery dates for these projects and we will not have the ability to estimate the project completion dates until activity resumes 
as a result of the project delays  we were required to record significant impairment losses related to these projects during the years ended december  and no impairment losses were recorded during the year ended december  in conjunction with these impairment losses  we were required to write down our investment in certain projects to zero as we determined that it was not likely we would recover our invested capital from future cash flows of each project 
during the year ended december   we dissolved our joint ventures with nare and tucker development for all phases of the north aurora town center and shops at lakemoor developments in conjunction with negotiated discounted payoffs of the debt encumbering the properties  for which we invested the equity 
as a result of the dissolution of these joint ventures  the properties became consolidated  non operating properties which have been recorded at fair value 
to provide clarity as to the current status of our remaining development projects  we have divided them into two categories  active projects and land held for future development 
the projects considered active projects are savannah crossing in aurora  illinois and southshore shopping center in boise  idaho 
construction is essentially complete at savannah crossing and southshore shopping center is a redevelopment of an existing building 
the remaining development property  lantern commons in westfield  indiana  is categorized as land held for future development 
we will deploy capital for construction or improvements to development properties only when we have signed commitments from retailers and cannot be sure of their exact nature or amounts until that time 
fair value disclosures reference is made to note  fair value disclosures to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our fair value disclosures as of december   which is incorporated into this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents non gaap financial measures we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities in which the reit holds an interest 
in addition  nareit has further clarified the ffo definition to add back impairment write downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate for all periods presented 
under us gaap  impairment charges reduce net income 
while impairment charges are added back in the calculation of ffo  we caution that because impairments to the value of any property are typically based on reductions in estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to current carrying value  declines in the undiscounted cash flows which led to the impairment charges reflect declines in property operating performance that may be permanent 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
we adjust ffo for the impact of non cash impairment charges of non depreciable real estate  net of taxes recorded in comparable periods  in order to present the performance of our core portfolio operations 
management uses the calculation of ffo and ffo adjusted for several reasons 
ffo is used in certain employment agreements we have with our executives to determine a portion of incentive compensation payable to them 
additionally  we use ffo and ffo adjusted to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
the following table reflects our ffo and ffo adjusted for the periods presented  reconciled to net income loss attributable to common stockholders for these periods

table of contents ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  and gains loss on non operating property 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to changes in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits 
we believe ebitda is an important supplemental non gaap measure 
we utilize ebitda to calculate our interest expense coverage ratio  which equals ebitda divided by total interest expense 
we believe that using ebitda  which excludes the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  all of which are based on historical cost and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  facilitates comparison of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  particularly in light of the use of ebitda by a seemingly large number of reits in their reports on forms q and k 
we believe that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required us gaap measures of our performance to improve their understanding of our operating results 
we adjust ebitda for the impact of non cash impairment charges in comparable periods in order to present the performance of our core portfolio operations

table of contents impact of recent accounting principles the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu aimed at increasing the prominence of comprehensive income in financial statements by requiring comprehensive income to be reported in either a single statement or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to report comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholder equity 
however  asu does not change the us gaap reporting requirements to report reclassification of items from comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
asu requires retrospective application 
this guidance was required to be implemented by us beginning january  the impact of the pronouncement did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have always disclosed the components of comprehensive income in a single statement along with net income 
the fasb issued asu to resolve the diversity in practice about whether previous guidance applies to a parent that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary nonrecourse debt 
under the amendments in this update  when a parent reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary nonrecourse debt  the reporting entity should apply the guidance in subtopic to determine whether it should derecognize the in substance real estate 
generally  a reporting entity would not satisfy the requirements to derecognize the in substance real estate before the legal transfer of the real estate to the lender and the extinguishment of the related nonrecourse indebtedness 
even if the reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest under subtopic  the reporting entity would continue to include the real estate  debt  and the results of the subsidiary operations in its consolidated financial statements until legal title to the real estate is transferred to legally satisfy the debt 
the impact of the pronouncement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have not surrendered control of any of our in substance real estate investments 
inflation certain long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of our leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
subsequent events reference is made to note  subsequent events to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our subsequent event disclosures  which is incorporated into this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply hedge accounting  as the instrument to be hedged will expose us to interest rate risk  and the derivative financial instrument is designed to reduce that exposure 
gains or losses related to the derivative financial instrument would be deferred and amortized over the terms of the hedged instrument 
if a derivative terminates or is sold  the gain or loss is recognized 
as of december   we have two interest rate swap contracts  which were entered into as requirements under our secured mortgages 
in december  we entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement with an original notional value of  and a maturity date of december  associated with the debt secured by first mortgages on a pool of eight investment properties 
this interest rate swap fixed the floating libor based debt under a variable rate loan to a fixed rate debt at an interest rate of per annum plus the applicable margin to manage the risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations  or an effective fixed rate of per annum 
in december  our joint venture with ipcc entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement with an original notional value of  and a maturity date of december  associated with the debt secured by a first mortgage on the dick sporting goods property 
this interest rate swap fixed the floating libor based debt under a variable rate loan to a fixed rate debt at an interest rate of per annum plus the applicable margin to manage the risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations  or an effective fixed rate of per annum 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fact that some of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
these variable rate loans are based on libor  therefore  fluctuations in libor impact our results of operations 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting this debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques  including periodically evaluating fixed interest rate quotes on all variable rate debt and the costs associated with converting the debt to fixed rate debt 
also  existing fixed and variable rate loans which are scheduled to mature in the next year or two are evaluated for possible early refinancing or extension based on our view of the current interest rate environment 
the table below presents the principal amount of the debt maturing each year  including monthly annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
the instruments  the principal amounts of which are presented below  were entered into for non trading purposes 
a thereafter total fair value b fixed rate debt c weighted average interest rate variable rate debt d e f g weighted average interest rate our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of the adjustment  our ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness  fixed rate debt that matures and needs to be refinanced and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
at december   approximately  or  of our debt bore interest at variable rates  with a weighted average rate of per annum 
an increase in the variable interest rates charged on debt containing variable interest rate terms  constitutes a market risk 
a annualized increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
equity price risk 
table of contents equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices 
our exposure to changes in equity prices results from our investment in securities 
at december   our investment in securities  classified as available for sale  totaled  the carrying values of investments in securities subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the date of the applicable consolidated balance sheets 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  therefore  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from any number of factors including perceived changes in the underlying fundamental characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
additionally  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
we do not engage in derivative or other hedging transactions to manage our equity price risk 
although it is difficult to project what factors may affect the prices of equity sectors and how much the effect might be  a increase or decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of december  and  would change their fair values by and  respectively
