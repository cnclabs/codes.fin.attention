item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net income for fiscal was million or per basic and diluted share  compared to net loss for fiscal of million or per basic and diluted share and a net loss for fiscal of million or per basic and diluted share 
the substantial improvement in our operating results is driven primarily by script count growth  the gross profit benefit from introductions of new generics and a current year lifo credit of million as compared to a charge last year  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
our operating results are described in more detail in the results of operations section below 
some of the key factors that impacted our results in fiscal  and are summarized as follows sales trends our revenue decline for fiscal was compared to revenue growth of for fiscal and a revenue decline of for fiscal fiscal revenues were negatively impacted by the extra week in fiscal and recent generic introductions  which have a substantially lower selling price than their brand counterparts  as well as continued reimbursement pressures 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of in same store prescription count 
gross profit our gross profit was positively impacted by recent generic introductions  which have a higher gross profit than their brand counterparts  increased same store prescription count and a current year lifo credit 
we record the value of our inventory on the last in  first out lifo method 
we recorded a non cash lifo credit of million  a non cash lifo charge of million and a non cash lifo charge of million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the current year lifo credit was due to significant generic drug deflation  partially offset by normal inflation on both brand drugs and front end products 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in fiscal due primarily to the reversal of certain tax indemnification assets partially offset by lower operating costs associated with one less week this year 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues relative to the prior year is due in part to the continued impact of recent generic introductions and reimbursement rate pressures which has resulted in a lower revenue base to measure our sg a expenses against 
lease termination and impairment charges we recorded lease terminations and impairment charges of million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our charges have been trending lower due to improved results of operations which reduces our impairment charges and closing fewer stores requiring lease termination charges 
debt refinancing during fiscal  we continued to take steps to extend the terms of our debt  reduce interest costs and to obtain more flexibility and we expect to engage in similar efforts in the future 
during fiscal  we completed two debt refinancings 
in february  we increased our senior secured revolving credit facility to billion  with an extended maturity of february  and obtained new first and second priority secured term loans of billion due and million due  respectively 
the proceeds from these new borrowings  along with available cash  were used to refinance billion of term loans and billion aggregate principal of senior secured notes and debentures 
this transaction resulted in a loss on debt retirement of million which was recorded in the fourth quarter 
this refinancing extends maturities and will reduce annual interest expense by million 
in february  we issued million of our senior notes due march and in may  we issued an additional million of our senior notes due the proceeds of the notes  together with available cash were used to repurchase and repay the senior notes due 
table of contents and the senior notes due  respectively 
this transaction resulted in a loss on debt retirement of million 
these transactions are described in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
income tax net income for fiscal included income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax benefit of million for fiscal and income tax expense of million for fiscal during fiscal we reached agreements with the internal revenue service irs and commonwealth of massachusetts appellate divisions settling the examinations of the brooks eckerd fiscal years and fiscal years  respectively 
the settlements with the irs and the commonwealth of massachusetts did not impact our net financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the benefit recognized in fiscal was primarily comprised of recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the appellate settlements discussed above 
this amount is offset by a reversal of the related tax indemnification asset which was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the fiscal income tax benefit was primarily attributable to the unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of statute of limitations and the income tax expense for fiscal comprised of the accrual of state and local taxes and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  asc precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets

the decrease in same stores sales was driven primarily by recent generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressures  partially offset by increased same store prescription count  the positive impact of our wellness loyalty program  and other management initiatives to increase sales 
the increase in same store prescription count was driven in part by the walgreens express scripts dispute which was settled in september  our immunization program and our wellness loyalty program 
we expect lower reimbursement rates  our cycling of the express scripts business and the softening benefit of new generic introductions in fiscal to continue to have a negative impact on our revenues 
same store sales trends for fiscal and fiscal are described in the following paragraphs 
we include in same store sales all stores that have been open at least one year 
stores in liquidation are considered closed 
relocation stores are not included in same store sales until one year has lapsed 
pharmacy same store sales decreased 
pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted by recent generic drug introductions  which have a substantially lower selling price than their brand counterparts but higher gross profit 
also contributing to the decrease are continued reimbursement rate pressures 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of in same store prescription count driven in part by incremental prescriptions gained from the walgreens express scripts dispute and by our immunization program and wellness loyalty program 

table of contents front end same store sales increased 
the increase in front end same store sales reflects the positive impact of our wellness loyalty program  incremental sales from our wellness format stores  and other management initiatives to increase front end sales 
active wellness members  defined as those who have used their cards at least twice during the last twenty six weeks  was over million as of march  we have completed wellness store remodels as of march  fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase in same store sales and an additional week in fiscal the increase in same store sales was driven by the positive impact of our wellness loyalty program  our flu immunization program and other management initiatives to increase sales and prescriptions 
these increases were partially offset due to lower pharmacy reimbursement rates and by operating fewer stores than last year 
same store sales trends for fiscal and fiscal are described in the following paragraphs 
pharmacy same store sales increased 
pharmacy same store sales were positively impacted by an increase of in same store prescriptions driven in part by our immunization program  our wellness loyalty program and inflation on brand drugs 
same store sales were also positively impacted by incremental prescriptions from the walgreens express scripts dispute and other initiatives to increase prescription count  partially offset by an approximate negative impact from new generic introductions and lower reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers and government payors

overall gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal pharmacy gross profit was higher due an increased number of prescriptions driven  in part  from the walgreens express scripts dispute  higher immunizations and our wellness loyalty program 

table of contents additionally  pharmacy gross margin improved due to significant recent generic introductions  partially offset by continued reimbursement rate pressure 
front end gross profit was slightly lower due to higher tier discounts from our wellness customer loyalty program and other markdowns  partially offset by increased sales 
front end gross margin was flat to the prior year 
gross profit increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to overall revenue growth 
pharmacy gross profit was higher due to increased prescription volume and the introduction of new generics including generic lipitor  partially offset by continued pressure on pharmacy benefit manager and governmental reimbursement rates 
front end gross profit was driven by higher sales reflecting the positive impact of our wellness loyalty program and continued strong rite aid brand private label penetration 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation  which is determined annually when inflation rates and inventory levels are finalized 
therefore  lifo costs for interim period financial statements are estimated 
the lifo credit for fiscal was million compared to a lifo charge of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the lifo credit for fiscal was primarily the result of significant generic drug deflation partially offset by normal inflation on brand drugs and front end products 
during fiscal  we experienced significant price decreases on the recent high volume generic introductions 
during the first few months after new generic drugs are introduced  supplier prices tend to decrease as multiple suppliers enter the market place 
the resulting impact was an approximate decline in our generic product price index this year compared to approximately last year 
this significant generic deflation was partially offset by our branded product inflation of approximately  resulting in a net deflation rate of approximately in our overall pharmacy product mix in fiscal  resulting in the lifo credit noted above 
during fiscal  we experienced significant brand price inflation of approximately 
brand pharmacy prices increased by approximately more than in fiscal we did not yet experience the significant generic deflation impact described above 
as a result  inflation on our overall pharmacy product mix was and we incurred the significant lifo charge noted above 
the charge in fiscal was higher than fiscal due to the higher branded product inflation rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to the reversal of million of tax indemnification asset resulting from our settlement with the irs and certain states associated with pre acquisition brooks eckerd tax issues  which are offset by an income tax benefit as noted below in income taxes  litigation charges relating to the settlement of certain labor related actions and increased associate bonus expense 
these amounts are partially offset by lower operating costs associated with one less week this year  lower depreciation and amortization  lower self insurance expense due primarily to the impact of the discount rate change on the prior year expense and the favorable settlement related to payment card interchange fee litigation 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues relative to the prior year is due in part to the continued impact of recent generic introductions and reimbursement rate pressures which has resulted in a lower revenue base to measure our sg a expenses against 
sg a expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due mostly to expenses associated with the fifty third week in fiscal sg a as a percentage of revenue improved over fiscal due to leveraging our fixed costs relative to revenue growth 
sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenues is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from continued labor control initiatives  lower occupancy and lower depreciation and amortization  and other cost 
table of contents containment initiatives 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in bonus expense relating to improved results and higher workers compensation costs associated with unfavorable discount rate changes 
lease termination and impairment charges impairment charges we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group has a carrying value that may not be recoverable 
the individual operating store is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
as such  we evaluate individual stores for recoverability of assets 
to determine if a store needs to be tested for recoverability  we consider items such as decreases in market prices  changes in the manner in which the store is being used or physical condition  changes in legal factors or business climate  an accumulation of losses significantly in excess of budget  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses  or an expectation that the store will be closed or sold 
we monitor new and recently relocated stores against operational projections and other strategic factors such as regional economics  new competitive entries and other local market considerations to determine if an impairment evaluation is required 
for other stores  we perform a recoverability analysis if they have experienced current period and historical cash flow losses 
in performing the recoverability test  we compare the expected future cash flows of a store to the carrying amount of its assets 
significant judgment is used to estimate future cash flows 
major assumptions that contribute to our future cash flow projections include expected sales  gross profit  and distribution expenses  expected costs such as payroll  occupancy costs and advertising expenses  and estimates for other significant selling  and general and administrative expenses 
many long term macro economic and industry factors are considered  both quantitatively and qualitatively  in our future cash flow assumptions 
in addition to current and expected economic conditions such as inflation  interest and unemployment rates that affect customer shopping patterns  we consider that we operate in a highly competitive industry which includes the actions of other national and regional drugstore chains  independently owned drugstores  supermarkets  mass merchandisers  dollar stores and internet pharmacies 
many of our competitors are spending significant capital and promotional dollars in certain geographies to gain market share 
we have assumed certain sales growth from our loyalty program and other initiatives to grow sales 
recent pharmacy benefit management consolidation and efforts of third party public and private payors have reduced pharmacy reimbursement rates in recent years 
we expect this rate compression  which currently affects over of our pharmacy business  to continue to affect us in the foreseeable future 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and must make assumptions related to federal and state efforts and proposals to affect the pricing and regulations related to prescription drugs  as well as  expected revenues and costs related to the patient protection and affordable care act health care reform 
additionally  we take into consideration that certain operating stores are executing specific improvement plans which are monitored quarterly to recoup recent capital investments  such as an acquisition of an independent pharmacy  which we have made to respond to specific competitive or local market conditions  or have specific programs tailored towards a specific geography or market 
we recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our methodology for recording impairment charges has not changed materially  and has been consistently applied in the periods presented 
at march   approximately billion of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  were associated with  active operating stores 

table of contents if an operating store estimated future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to cover its carrying value  its carrying value is reduced to fair value which is its estimated future discounted cash flows 
the discount rate is commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of a similar asset 
an impairment charge is recorded in the period that the store does not meet its original return on investment and or has an operating loss for the last two years and its projected cash flows do not exceed its current asset carrying value 
the amount of the impairment charge is the entire difference between the current carrying asset value and the estimated fair value of the assets using discounted future cash flows 
most stores are fully impaired in the period that the impairment charge is originally recorded 
we recorded impairment charges for active stores of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we review key performance results for active stores on a quarterly basis and approve certain stores for closure 
impairment for closed stores  if any many stores are closed on lease expiration  are recorded in the quarter the closure decision is made and approved 
closure decisions are made on an individual store or regional basis considering all of the macro economic  industry and other factors discussed above  in addition to  the operating store individual operating results 
we currently have no plans to close a significant number of active stores in future periods 
in the next fiscal year  we currently expect to close fewer than stores  primarily as a result of lease expirations 
we recorded impairment charges for closed facilities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in the impairment charges noted above were charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal for existing owned surplus property 
assets to be disposed of are evaluated quarterly to determine if an additional impairment charge is required 
fair value estimates are provided by independent brokers who operate in the local markets where the assets are located 

table of contents the following table summarizes the impairment charges and number of locations  segregated by closed facilities and active stores that have been recorded in fiscal  and year ended march  march  february  number charge number charge number charge closed facilities actual and approved store closings actual and approved relocations distribution center closings existing surplus properties total impairment charges closed facilities active stores additional current period charges for stores previously impaired in prior periods charges for new and relocated stores that did not meet their asset recoverability test in the current period charges for the remaining stores that did not meet their asset recoverability test in the current period total impairment charges active stores total impairment charges all locations total number of active stores stores impaired in prior periods with no current charge stores with a current period charge total cumulative active stores with impairment charges these charges are related to stores that were impaired for the first time in prior periods 
most active stores  requiring an impairment charge  are fully impaired in the first period that they do not meet their asset recoverability test 
however  in each prior period presented  a minority of stores were partially impaired since their fair value supported a reduced net book value 
accordingly  these stores may be further impaired in the current and future periods as a result of changes in their actual or projected cash flows  or changes to their fair value estimates 
also  we make ongoing capital additions to certain stores to improve their operating results or to meet geographical competition  which if later are deemed to be unrecoverable  will be impaired in future periods 
of this total   and stores for fiscal years  and respectively have been fully impaired 
these charges are related to new stores open at least years and relocated stores relocated in the last years that did not meet their recoverability test during the current period 
these stores have not met our original return on investment projections and have a historical loss of at least years 
their future cash flow projections do not recover their current carrying value 
of this total   and stores for fiscal years  and respectively have been fully impaired 
these charges are related to the remaining active stores that did not meet the recoverability test during the current period 
these stores have a historical loss of at least years 
their future cash flow projections do not recover their current carrying value 
of this total   and stores for fiscal years  and respectively have been fully impaired 

table of contents the primary drivers of our impairment charges are each store current and historical operating performance and the assumptions that we make about each store operating performance in future periods 
projected cash flows are updated based on the next year operating budget which includes the qualitative factors noted above 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty which individual stores will fall short or exceed future operating plans 
accordingly  we are unable to describe future trends that would affect our impairment charges  including the likely stores and their related asset values that may fail their recoverability test in future periods 
to the extent that actual future cash flows differ from our projections materially  because of the reasons discussed above  certain stores that are either not impaired or partially impaired in the current period may be further impaired in future periods 
a basis point decrease in our future sales assumptions as of march  would have resulted in an additional fiscal impairment charge of million 
a basis point increase in our future sales assumptions as of march  would have reduced the fiscal impairment charge by million 
changes in our discount rate of basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal lease termination charges charges to close a store  which principally consist of continuing lease obligations  are recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated  pursuant to the guidance set forth in asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we assess stores and distribution centers for potential closure 
decisions to close or relocate stores or distribution centers in future periods would result in lease termination charges for lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory  as well as impairment of assets at these locations 
in fiscal  and  we recorded lease termination charges of million  million and million 
these charges related to changes in future assumptions  interest accretion and provisions for stores in fiscal  stores in fiscal  and stores and one distribution center in fiscal interest expense in fiscal   and  interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
the reduction in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to one less week in the current year 
the reduction in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to favorable interest rates resulting from our march tranche term loan refinancing and the august refinancing of our tranche term loan partially offset by the impact of the fifty third week 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
income taxes income tax benefit of million  income tax benefit of million and income tax expense of million  has been recorded for fiscal  and  respectively 
net income for fiscal included income tax benefit of million primarily comprised of adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits for the appellate settlements of the brooks eckerd irs audit for the fiscal years and the commonwealth of massachusetts audit for fiscal years as well as for the lapse of statute of limitations 
the appellate settlements as well as the majority of the lapse of statue of limitations is offset by a reversal of the related tax indemnification asset which was recorded 
table of contents in selling  general and administrative expenses as these audits were related to pre acquisition periods 
additionally  the income tax benefit was recorded net of adjustments to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the recognition of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect recognition of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  asc precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income generated in the carryforward periods 
the fiscal income tax benefit of million was primarily comprised of adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of statute of limitations 
the fiscal income tax expense of million was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes  adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits and the need for an accrual of additional state taxes resulting from the receipt of a final audit determination 
we monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
we maintained a full valuation allowance of  million and  million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end and  respectively 
dilutive equity issuances on march   million shares of common stock  which includes unvested restricted shares  were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible preferred stock and convertible notes 
on march   our million shares of potentially issuable common stock consisted of the following shares in thousands strike price outstanding stock options a preferred stock convertible notes total and under to to to to to and over total issuable shares a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million 
liquidity and capital resources general we have two primary sources of liquidity i cash provided by operating activities and ii borrowings under the revolving credit facility of our senior secured credit facility 
our principal uses 
table of contents of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt and to fund capital expenditures 
total liquidity as of march  was  million  which consisted of revolver borrowing capacity of  million and invested cash of million 
credit facility in february  we amended and restated our existing senior secured revolving credit facility  entered into a new billion tranche term loan due under our senior secured credit facility and entered into a new million tranche term loan due under our new second priority secured term loan facility 
a portion of the proceeds from these transactions were used to refinance our billion tranche term loan due and our million tranche term loan due as amended and restated  our senior secured credit facility consists of a billion revolving credit facility and a billion tranche term loan 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest from february  through may  at a rate per annum of libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or citibank base rate plus  and thereafter at a rate per annum between libor plus and libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or between citibank base rate plus and citibank base rate plus in each case based upon the amount of revolver availability as defined in the senior secured credit facility 
we are required to pay fees between and per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver  depending on the amount of revolver availability 
amounts drawn under the revolver become due and payable on february   provided that such maturity date shall be accelerated to ninety one days prior to the maturity of our senior secured notes due  in the event that we do not repay or refinance such notes on or prior to such date  or ninety one days prior to the maturity of our senior notes due  in the event that we do not repay or refinance such notes on or prior to such date 
our ability to borrow under the revolver is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable  inventory and prescription files 
at march   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolver and had letters of credit outstanding against the revolver of million  which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of  million 
the credit facility also includes our billion senior secured term loan the tranche term loan 
the tranche term loan matures on february  and currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus with a libor floor of  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank base rate plus 
we must make mandatory prepayments of the tranche term loan with the proceeds of certain asset dispositions and casualty events subject to certain limitations  and with the proceeds of certain issuances of debt subject to certain exceptions  provided that no such prepayment shall be required to be made with respect to excess cash flow for the fiscal year ended march  if at any time there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility  prepayment of the tranche term loan may also be required 
the senior secured credit facility restricts us and the subsidiary guarantors from accumulating cash on hand in excess of million at any time when revolving loans are outstanding not including cash located in our store deposit accounts  cash necessary to cover our current liabilities and certain other exceptions and from accumulating cash on hand with revolver borrowings in excess of million over three consecutive business days 
the senior secured credit facility also states that if at any time other than following the exercise of remedies or acceleration of any senior obligations or second priority debt and receipt of a triggering notice by the senior collateral agent from a representative of the senior obligations or the second priority debt either a an event of default exists under our senior secured credit facility or b the sum of revolver availability under our senior secured 
table of contents credit facility and certain amounts held on deposit with the senior collateral agent in a concentration account is less than million for three consecutive business days a cash sweep period  the funds in our deposit accounts will be swept to a concentration account with the senior collateral agent and will be applied first to repay outstanding revolving loans under the senior secured credit facility  and then held as collateral for the senior obligations until such cash sweep period is rescinded pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding  at any time  up to billion in secured second priority debt and unsecured debt in addition to borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and existing indebtedness  provided that not in excess of million of such secured second priority debt and unsecured debt shall mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to may  the senior secured credit facility allows us to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt with a maturity beyond may   however  other outstanding indebtedness limits the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence of said debt or other exemptions are not available 
the senior secured credit facility also contains certain restrictions on the amount of secured first priority debt we are able to incur 
the senior secured facility also allows  so long as the senior secured credit facility is not in default and we maintain availability on the revolving credit facility of more than million  for the voluntary repurchase of any debt and the mandatory repurchase of our convertible notes due our senior secured credit facility contains covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above  the payment of dividends  sale of assets  mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens 
our credit facility also has one financial covenant  which is the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenant requires that  if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million  we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
as of march   we were in compliance with this financial covenant 
the senior secured credit facility provides for customary events of default including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if we fail to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of million or any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity or require the repurchase of such debt 
the mandatory repurchase of the convertible notes due is excluded from this event of default 
on february   we executed a credit agreement governing a new second priority secured term loan facility  which includes our second priority secured term loan the tranche term loan 
the tranche term loan matures on august  and currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus with a libor floor of  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank base rate plus 
the second priority secured term loan facility and the indentures that govern our secured and guaranteed unsecured notes contain restrictions on the amount of additional secured and unsecured debt that can be incurred by us 
as of march   the amount of additional secured debt that could be incurred under the second priority secured term loan facility and these indentures was approximately billion which amount does not include the ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions 
however  we currently cannot incur any additional secured debt assuming a fully drawn revolver and the outstanding letters of credit 
the ability to issue additional unsecured debt under these indentures is generally governed by an interest coverage ratio test 
as of march   we had the ability to issue additional unsecured debt under the second lien credit facility and other indentures 
other transactions in february  we used a portion of the proceeds from the tranche term loan  the proceeds from our tranche second lien term loan  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and

net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by net income and a reduction of inventory resulting primarily from recent generic introductions  generic price reductions  management initiatives to reduce inventory levels and fewer open stores  and a reduction of accounts receivable due to the timing of payments from third party payors 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by the reduction in net loss  an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of purchases partially offset by an increase in inventory resulting primarily from price inflation and increased store inventory to support sales growth 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by a reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of purchases 
additionally  the reductions in accounts receivable were no longer offset by repayments to the receivables securitization facility which was eliminated in the third quarter of fiscal cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescriptions files which was partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions and sale leaseback transactions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions and sale leaseback transactions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily due to the issuance of our  million tranche term loan due  million tranche term loan due and million of our senior notes due  along with borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million 
proceeds from these issuances were used to repay our  million tranche term loan due  million of our senior secured notes due  million of our senior secured notes due  our million tranche term loan due  million of our senior notes due  million of our senior notes due  million of our senior notes due we also made scheduled payments of million and million of our capital lease obligations and our tranche and tranche term loans  respectively 
additionally  we incurred financing fees for early debt retirement of million and cash paid for deferred financing costs of million in connection with the above transactions 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily due to increased revolver borrowings coupled with the february issuance of million of our senior notes due march  and concurrent repurchase of million of our senior notes due march the remaining million of the senior notes due march were repurchased in march cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily due to the refinancing activity that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal  the repurchase of million of the convertible notes  other scheduled debt repayments and a small decrease in our zero balance cash accounts 
capital expenditures during the fifty two week period ended march   we spent million on capital expenditures  consisting of million related to new store construction  store relocation and store remodel projects  million related to technology enhancements  improvements to distribution centers and other corporate requirements  and million related to the purchase of prescription files from other retail pharmacies 
we plan on making total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately related to store relocations and remodels and new store construction  related to infrastructure and maintenance requirements and related to prescription file purchases 
we expect that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness could i limit our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon our current levels of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures at least for the next twelve months 
based on our liquidity position  which we expect to remain strong throughout the year  we do not expect the restriction on our senior secured credit facility  that could result if we fail to meet the fixed charge covenant in our senior secured credit facility  to impact our business in the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance  and other relevant circumstances 
it is our belief that although it is not likely  should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
from time to time  we may seek deleveraging transactions  including entering into transactions to exchange debt for shares of common stock  issuance of equity including preferred stock and convertible securities  repurchase outstanding indebtedness  or seek to refinance our outstanding debt or may otherwise seek transactions to reduce interest expense and extend debt maturities 
any of these transactions could impact our financial results 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory shrink  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  self insurance liabilities  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
variability reflected in the sensitivity analyses presented below is based on our recent historical experience 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and sensitivity analyses 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management inventory shrink the carrying value of our inventory is reduced by a reserve for estimated shrink losses that occur between physical inventory dates 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations  as well as overall loss trends as determined during physical inventory procedures 
the estimated shrink rate is calculated by dividing historical shrink results for stores inventoried in the most recent six months by the sales for the same period 
shrink expense is recognized by applying the estimated shrink rate to sales since the last physical inventory 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our shrink rate over the last three years 
although possible  we do not expect a significant change to our shrink rate in future periods 
a basis point difference in our estimated shrink rate for the year ended march   would have affected pre tax income by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group has a carrying value that may not be recoverable 
the individual operating store is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
as such  we evaluate individual stores for recoverability 
to determine if a store needs to be tested for recoverability  we consider items such as decreases in market prices  changes in the manner in which the store is being used or physical condition  changes in legal factors or business climate  an accumulation of losses significantly in excess of budget  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses  or an expectation that the store will be closed or sold 
we monitor new and recently relocated stores against operational projections and other strategic factors such as regional economics  new competitive entries and other local market considerations to determine if an impairment evaluation is required 
for other stores  we perform a recoverability analysis if they have experienced current period and historical cash flow losses 
in performing the recoverability test  we compare the expected future cash flows of a store to the carrying amount of its assets 
significant judgment is used to estimate future cash flows 
major assumptions that contribute to our future cash flow projections include expected sales and gross profit  expected costs such as payroll  occupancy costs and advertising expenses  and estimates for other significant selling  general and administrative expenses 
if an operating store estimated future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to cover its carrying value  its carrying value is reduced to fair value which is its estimated future discounted cash flows 
the discount rate is commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of a similar asset 
we regularly approve certain stores for closure 
impairment charges for closed stores  if any  are evaluated and recorded in the quarter the closure decision is approved 

table of contents we also evaluate assets to be disposed of on a quarterly basis to determine if an additional impairment charge is required 
fair value estimates are provided by independent brokers who operate in the local markets where the assets are located 
if our actual future cash flows differ from our projections materially  certain stores that are either not impaired or partially impaired in the current period may be further impaired in future periods 
a basis point decrease in our future sales assumptions as of march  would have resulted in an additional fiscal impairment charge of million 
a basis point increase in our future sales assumptions as of march  would have reduced the fiscal impairment charge by million 
changes in our discount rate of basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal revenue recognition for our loyalty program we offer a chain wide customer loyalty program  wellness 
members participating in our wellness loyalty card program earn points on a calendar year basis for eligible front end merchandise purchases and qualifying prescriptions 
one point is awarded for each dollar spent towards front end merchandise and points are awarded for each qualifying prescription 
members reach specific wellness tiers based on the points accumulated during the calendar year  which entitle them to certain future discounts and other benefits upon reaching that tier 
for example  any customer that reaches  points in a calendar year achieves the gold tier  enabling the customer to receive a discount on qualifying purchases of front end merchandise for the remaining portion of the calendar year and the next calendar year 
there are also similar silver and bronze levels with lower thresholds and benefit levels 
as wellness customers accumulate points  we defer the value of the points earned as deferred revenue based on the expected usage 
the amount deferred is based on historic and projected customer activity eg  tier level  spending level 
as customers receive discounted front end merchandise  we recognize an allocable portion of the deferred revenue 
if the achieved combined gold  silver  and bronze levels differ from the assumptions by it would have affected pretax income by million 
if the assumed spending levels  which are the drivers of future discounts  differ by it would have affected pretax income by million 
self insurance liabilities we expense claims for self insured workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage as incurred including an estimate for claims incurred but not paid 
the expense for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims incurred but not paid is determined using several factors  including historical claims experience and development  severity of claims  medical costs and the time needed to settle claims 
we discount the estimated expense for workers compensation to present value as the time period from incurrence of the claim to final settlement can be several years 
we base our estimates for such timing on previous settlement activity 
the discount rate is based on the current market rates for treasury bills that approximate the average time to settle the workers compensation claims 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis 
a basis point difference in the discount rate for the year ended march   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
lease termination charges we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs and anticipated future subleases of properties 
the reserves are calculated at the individual location level and the assumptions are assessed at that level 
the reserve for lease exit liabilities is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
reserve estimates and related assumptions are updated on a quarterly basis 
a substantial amount of our closed stores were closed prior to our adoption of asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
therefore  if interest rates change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
in addition  changes in the real estate leasing markets can have an impact on the reserve 
as of 
table of contents march   a basis point variance in the credit adjusted risk free interest rate would have affected pretax income by approximately million for fiscal income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate significant deferred tax assets which are currently offset by a valuation allowance 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence including our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
the weight given to the potential effect of the negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our valuation allowance over the last three years 
however  changes in market conditions and the impact of the acquisition of brooks eckerd on operations have caused changes in the valuation allowance from period to period which were included in the tax provision in the period of change 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
these estimates are updated as the facts and circumstances of the cases develop and or change 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
changes to these reserves during the last three fiscal years were not material 
adjusted ebitda and other non gaap measures in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap  we use certain non gaap measures  such as adjusted ebitda  in assessing our operating performance 
we believe the non gaap metrics serve as an appropriate measure to be used in evaluating the performance of our business 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss excluding the impact of income taxes and any corresponding reduction of tax indemnification asset  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  lifo adjustments  charges or credits for facility closing and impairment  inventory write downs related to store closings  stock based compensation expense  debt retirements  sale of assets and investments  revenue deferrals related to customer loyalty programs and other items 
we reference this particular non gaap financial measure frequently in our decision making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors historical operating performance 
in addition  incentive compensation is based on adjusted ebitda and we base certain of our forward looking estimates on adjusted ebitda to facilitate quantification of planned business activities and enhance subsequent follow up with comparisons of actual to planned adjusted ebitda 

table of contents the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss for fiscal  and march  weeks march  weeks february  weeks net income loss interest expense income tax benefit expense reduction of tax indemnification asset depreciation and amortization expense lifo credits charges lease termination and impairment charges stock based compensation expense gain on sale of assets  net loss on debt retirements  net closed facility liquidation expense severance costs customer loyalty card program revenue deferral other adjusted ebitda note the income tax benefit from the irs settlement described in footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and the corresponding reduction of the tax indemnification asset had no net effect on adjusted ebitda 
in addition to adjusted ebitda  we occasionally refer to several other non gaap measures  on a less frequent basis  in order to describe certain components of our business and how we utilize them to describe our results 
these measures include but are not limited to adjusted ebitda gross margin and gross profit gross margin gross profit excluding non adjusted ebitda items  adjusted ebitda sg a sg a expenses excluding non adjusted ebitda items  fifo gross margin gross margin before lifo charges and free cash flow adjusted ebitda less cash paid for interest  rent on closed stores  capital expenditures and the change in working capital 
we include these non gaap financial measures in our earnings announcements and guidance in order to provide transparency to our investors and enable investors to better compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures 
adjusted ebitda or other non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from  and are not intended to represent an alternative measure of  operating results or of cash flows from operating activities  as determined in accordance with gaap 
our definition of these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest 
table of contents rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
we currently do not have any derivative transactions outstanding 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of march  thereafter total fair value at march  dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion  excluding capital lease obligations fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our ability to satisfy interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on our variable rate borrowings  which include our revolving credit facility  our tranche term loan and tranche term loan  are all based on libor 
however  the interest rate on our tranche term loan and tranche term loan have a libor floor of basis points 
if the market rates of interest for libor changed by basis points as of march   our annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
a change in interest rates does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures 
increases in interest rates would also impact our ability to refinance existing maturities on favorable terms
