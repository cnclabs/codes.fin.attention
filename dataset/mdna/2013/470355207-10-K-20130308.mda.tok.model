item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and selected financial data included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors  including the risks discussed in risk factors in this filing 
for more on forward looking statements  see the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this report 
overview we mine  process and sell thermal and metallurgical coal through eight active mining complexes located throughout eastern kentucky  southern west virginia and southern indiana 
the majority of our metallurgical coal was obtained in the april  acquisition the irp acquisition of international resource partners lp and its subsidiary companies collectively irp 
we have two reportable business segments based on the coal basins in which we operate central appalachia capp and the midwest midwest 
irp is included in our capp segment 
we derived of our total revenues in from coal sales to electric utility customers and the remaining from coal sales including metallurgical coal to industrial and other customers 
in  our mines produced million tons of coal including million tons of contract coal and we purchased another million tons for resale 
of the million tons produced from company mines  approximately came from underground mines  while the remaining came from surface mines 
in  we generated total revenues of billion and had a net loss of million 
capp segment in central appalachia  our thermal coal sales are primarily to customers in the southern portion of the south atlantic region of the united states 
the south atlantic region includes the states of florida  georgia  south carolina  north carolina  west virginia  virginia  maryland and delaware 
our metallurgical coal is sold primarily to steel companies in north america  south america  europe  asia and africa 
approximately of our total revenues in the capp segment in were derived from sales made outside the united states  including brazil  canada  egypt  france  germany  india and the united kingdom 
in  our capp mines produced million tons of coal including million tons of contract coal and we purchased another million tons for resale 
of the million tons produced from capp company mines  came from company operated underground mines 
in  we shipped million tons of coal and generated coal sale revenues of million from our capp segment 
in  us steel  steel authority of india limited and georgia power company were our largest customers  representing approximately   and of our total revenues  respectively 
no other capp customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
as of december   we estimate that we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in our capp segment 
based on our most recent analysis prepared by marshall miller associates  inc mm a as of march  and december   we estimate that these reserves have an average heat content of  btu per pound and an average sulfur content of 
at current production levels  we believe these reserves would support more than years of production 
midwest segment in the midwest  the majority of our coal is sold in the east north central region  which includes the states of illinois  indiana  ohio  michigan and wisconsin 
in  our midwest mines produced approximately million tons of coal 
of the midwest tons produced  came from company operated surface mines 
in  we shipped million tons of coal and generated coal sale revenues of million from our midwest segment 
no midwest customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
as of december   we estimate that we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in our midwest segment 
based on our most recent analyses prepared by mm a as of february  and april   we estimate that these reserves have an average heat content of  btu per pound and average sulfur content of 
at current production levels  we believe these reserves would support more than years of production 
reserves mm a prepared a detailed study of our capp reserves as of march  based on all of our geologic information  including our updated drilling and mining data 
mm a also prepared a detailed study as of december  for the reserves obtained in the irp acquisition which was based in part on previous evaluations of the properties 
for our midwest reserves  mm a prepared a detailed study as of february  for the reserves obtained in the acquisition of triad mining  inc and as of april  for certain additional reserves acquired in the second quarter of in the midwest 
the mm a studies were planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance of the subject demonstrated reserves 
in connection with the studies  mm a prepared reserve maps and had certified professional geologists develop estimates based on data supplied by us  triad and irp using standards accepted by government and industry 
we have used mm a s march  study of the capp reserves and the december  study of the reserves acquired from irp as the basis for our current internal estimate of our capp reserves and mm a s february  and april  studies as the basis for our current internal estimate of our midwest reserves 
reserves for these purposes are defined by sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
the reserve estimates were prepared using industry standard methodology to provide reasonable assurance that the reserves are recoverable  considering technical  economic and legal limitations 
although mm a has reviewed our reserves and found them to be reasonable notwithstanding unforeseen geological  market  labor or regulatory issues that may affect the operations  mm a s engagement did not include performing an economic feasibility study for our reserves 
in accordance with standard industry practice  we have performed our own economic feasibility analysis for our reserves 
it is not generally considered to be practical  however  nor is it standard industry practice  to perform a feasibility study for a company s entire reserve portfolio 
in addition  mm a did not independently verify our control of our properties  and has relied solely on property information supplied by us 
reserve acreage  average seam thickness  average seam density and average mine and wash recovery percentages were verified by mm a to prepare a reserve tonnage estimate for each reserve 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves as discussed in critical accounting estimates coal reserves 
based on the mm a reserve studies and the foregoing assumptions and qualifications  and after giving effect to our operations from the respective dates of the studies through december   we estimate that  as of december   we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the capp region and million tons in the midwest region 
the following table provides additional information regarding changes to our reserves for the year ended december  in millions of tons capp midwest total proven and probable reserves  as of december  coal extracted acquisitions adjustments divesture proven and probable reserves  as of december  calculated in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
proven reserves have the highest degree of geologic assurance and are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings  or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspections  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserves have a moderate degree of geologic assurance and are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
this reserve information reflects recoverable tonnage on an as received basis with moisture 
represents estimated reserves on leases entered into or properties acquired during the relevant period 
we calculated the reserves in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
represents changes in reserves due to additional information obtained from exploration activities  production activities or discovery of new geologic information 
we calculated the adjustments to the reserves in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
represents changes in reserves due to expired or transferred leases 
in the company transferred leases with estimated reserves of approximately million tons and related reclamation liabilities to a third party 
key performance indicators we manage our business through several key performance metrics that provide a summary of information in the areas of sales  operations  and general and administrative costs 
in the sales area  our long term metrics are the volume weighted average remaining term of our contracts and our open contract position for the next several years 
during periods of high prices  we may seek to lengthen the average remaining term of our contracts and reduce the open tonnage for future periods 
in the short term  we closely monitor the average selling price per ton asp  and the mix between our spot sales and contract sales 
in the operations area  we monitor the volume of coal that is produced by each of our principal sources  including company mines  contract mines  and purchased coal sources 
for our company mines  we focus on both operating costs and operating productivity 
we closely monitor the cost per ton of our mines against our budgeted costs and against our other mines 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also measures used by management to measure operating performance 
we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense net  income tax expense benefit and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
we regularly use ebitda to evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates 
in addition  we use ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets 
ebitda is not a recognized term under u 
s generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and is not an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of operating liquidity 
adjusted ebitda is used in calculating compliance with our debt covenants and adjusts ebitda for certain items as defined in our debt agreements  including stock compensation  acquisition costs and certain bank fees 
trends and uncertainties in our business coal prices continue to suffer from a mixture of lower natural gas prices  increased government regulation and the global economic slowdown 
historically low natural gas prices have increased natural gas share of electricity production 
production of natural gas from non traditional shale sources has resulted in growing natural gas inventories and lower prices 
in recent months  the price of natural gas has rebounded from its april low of per mmbtu to an average of per mmbtu in december the us energy information administration eia estimates that the average natural gas spot price will be per mmbtu 
by comparison  the average spot price for natural gas in was per mmbtu 
natural gas prices are expected to increase due to reductions in the number of natural gas rigs operating  which was as of december   compared to at the beginning of  curbed production from less profitable dry natural gas wells  and increased consumption in the eastern part of the united states where a more normal winter is expected after an unseasonably warm winter 
the eia forecasts that the year over year gains for natural gas share of electricity generation should slow and then reverse as higher natural gas prices  along with record coal inventories  encourage utilities to increase their utilization of coal fired power plants 
coal s share of electricity generation is forecasted to rise by in  in comparison to a decline for natural gas 
nonetheless  use of natural gas for power generation will remain high by historical standards 
the weakness in the us domestic coal market has been partially offset by strong us coal exports 
according to the eia  in  the us exported million short tons of coal  the highest since  and is forecasted to have exported million short tons in the eia expects exports to decline but remain above million short tons 
the central appalachia region  which accounts for all of our shipments to international markets  has been the primary beneficiary of the export market  largely due to central appalachia s production of metallurgical coal 
while we anticipate that the demand for metallurgical coal will continue to be strong in the future  recent uncertainty in europe and slowing economies in china  india and brazil have reduced near term pricing and demand 
in response to the lower prices and weaker demand for both steam and metallurgical coal  a number of publicly traded central appalachia producers have announced production cuts and layoffs 
because the central appalachia production market is fragmented with numerous small operators  it is difficult to quantify the total of central appalachia production cuts 
to address the weak market for coal  we have managed our production by idling five underground mines  two preparation plants and one load out and reducing production at three surface mines 
these and previous changes will reduce our annual production capacity by million tons and impact approximately employees and contractors 
in addition to coal prices and demand  our profitability is affected by our production costs  which have increased in recent years 
we expect the higher costs to continue for the next several years  due to a number of factors  including increased governmental regulations  high prices in worldwide commodity markets  and a highly competitive market for a limited supply of skilled mining personnel

our metallurgical coal operations were responsible for and of total production in and  respectively 
our metallurgical operations costs decreased by per ton  which is primarily due to a decrease in the price of purchased metallurgical coal 
our costs continue to be impacted by lower productivity due to increased federal and state regulatory scrutiny  a decrease in tons produced in response to market conditions and an increase in commodity prices

generally  the mines acquired from irp have more metallurgical coal than our legacy operations 
these metallurgical coal mines produce higher coal sales revenue but are more costly to mine 
our costs were also impacted by an increase in metallurgical coal purchased that is used to blend with our metallurgical coal production to meet quality requirements under our sales contracts 
the impact of the change in our mix to additional metallurgical coal production is approximately per ton 
the remaining increase of over the prior year is primarily due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs of per ton  variable costs of per ton and preparation plants and raw trucking costs of at our mines that do not produce metallurgical coal

the debt repurchases were made at a cost of million  plus accrued interest of million  in open market purchases 
the repurchases resulted in a gain of million  which includes the write off of million of financing costs

as of december   we had used million of the million then available under the revolver to secure outstanding letters of credit 
we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our outstanding debt instruments as of december  we cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance in subsequent periods 
if necessary  we will consider seeking a waiver or other alternatives to remain in compliance with the covenants 
for more detail regarding the covenants under our indebtedness  see part i item a risk factors we may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness  which could result in a default under these instruments 
liquidity as of december   we had total liquidity of approximately million  consisting of million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolver and million of cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash and short term investments 
as of december   we had used million of the availability under the revolver to secure outstanding letters of credit 
our primary source of cash is expected to be sales of coal to our utility  industrial and steel customers 
the price of coal received can change dramatically based on market factors and will directly affect this source of cash 
our primary uses of cash include the payment of ordinary mining expenses to mine coal  capital expenditures  scheduled debt and interest payments and benefit payments 
ordinary mining expenses are driven by the cost of supplies  including steel prices and diesel fuel 
benefit payments include payments for workers compensation and black lung benefits paid over the lives of our employees as the claims are submitted 
we are required to pay these when due  and are not required to set aside cash for these payments 
we have posted surety bonds secured by letters of credit or issued letters of credit with state regulatory departments to guarantee these payments 
we believe that our revolver provides us with the ability to meet the necessary bonding requirements 
we currently project that in our capital expenditures will be approximately million  cash interest on our long term debt to be approximately million and fees under our revolver for letters of credit will total approximately million 
we expect that such expenditures will exceed cash generated by operations and will need to be funded through cash on hand  however we expect that cash on hand will be sufficient throughout to meet our debt covenants 
our cash position beyond will depend on numerous factors such as the market for our coal  capital expenditures  commodity costs and absent improvements to current market conditions  we would likely need to secure additional sources of liquidity to meet our cash requirements 
we believe that currently available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolver will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments throughout nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations including refinancing debt that matures in  or fund planned capital expenditures  will substantially depend upon our future operating performance  debt covenants  and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in the event that the sources of cash described above are not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements  we will need to reduce certain planned expenditures  seek additional financing  or both 
we may seek to raise funds through additional debt financing or the issuance of additional equity securities 
if such actions are not sufficient  we may need to limit our growth  sell assets or reduce or curtail some of our operations to levels consistent with the constraints imposed by our available cash flow  or any combination of these options 
our ability to seek additional debt or equity financing may be limited by our existing and any future financing arrangements  economic and financial conditions  or all three 
in particular  our existing senior notes  convertible senior notes  convertible senior notes and revolver restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
we cannot provide assurance that any reductions in our planned expenditures or in our expansion would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that additional debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our projected capital expenditures for of million primarily consist of capital expenditures for normal mining activities including new and replacement mine equipment 
our projected capital expenditures for also include approximately million for safety mandates and new mine and infrastructure development 
net cash from operating activities reflects net income loss adjusted for non cash charges and changes in net working capital including non current operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
during  our net loss of million was adjusted by non cash charges of million 
during  our net loss  as adjusted for non cash charges was decreased by a million decrease in cash from our operating assets and liabilities 
the million change in our operating assets and liabilities for includes a million decrease in inventories  million decrease in accounts receivables and a million decrease in accounts payable 
during  our net loss of million was adjusted by non cash charges of million 
during  our net loss  as adjusted for non cash charges was increased by a million increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the million change in our operating assets and liabilities for includes a million decrease in receivables and a million increase in inventory 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million in as compared to  which includes a payment for the irp acquisition net of cash acquired  of million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment decreased million to million in as compared to capital expenditures primarily consisted of new and replacement mine equipment and various projects to improve the production and efficiency of our mining operations 
additionally  during and  our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment included approximately million and million  respectively  for safety mandates and new mine and infrastructure development 
net cash used in financing activities was million in and consists of repayment of debt 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and consists of million of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and the convertible senior notes  net of debt issuance costs  million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  which were offset by million used to repay the senior notes  and million of costs in connection with the amendments and restatements to the revolver 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt   cash interest on long term debt and fees under our revolver for letters of credit     operating lease obligations    royalty obligations    purchase obligations consists of our senior notes and our and convertible senior notes 
consists of interest payments on our senior notes and our and convertible senior notes 
also includes a charge associated with outstanding letters of credit fees under the revolver through the revolver s maturity assumes the full amount of the revolver capacity is used for letters of credit 
no replacement facilities are shown to replace the senior notes  and convertible senior notes or revolver upon expiration of those facilities 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on leases 
royalty obligations include minimum royalty s payable on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  we have generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of ten years 
certain coal leases require payment based on minimum tonnage  for these contracts an average sales price of per ton was used to project the future commitment 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on royalty obligations 
purchase obligations do not include agreements to purchase coal with vendors that are less than months in length  do not include quantities or minimum tonnages  or monthly purchase orders 
additionally  we have liabilities relating to pension  workers compensation  black lung  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   the undiscounted payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years our determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting estimates in management s discussion and analysis 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  we do not expect any material impact on our cash flow  results of operations or financial condition from these off balance sheet arrangements 
we use surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation and other miscellaneous obligations 
at december   we had million of outstanding surety bonds with third parties 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment  collection bonds  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
surety bond costs have increased over time and the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
we also use cash collateral accounts and bank letters of credit to secure our obligations for post mining reclamation  workers compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
as of december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding 
the letters of credit are issued under our revolver 
critical accounting estimates overview our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
us gaap require estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts for assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the estimates and judgments we make in connection with our consolidated financial statements are based on historical experience and various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements lists and describes our significant accounting policies 
the following critical accounting policies have a material effect on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment  with assistance of third party valuation services  and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  market prices and asset lives  among other items 
workers compensation we are liable under various state statutes for providing workers compensation benefits 
except as indicated  we are self insured for workers compensation at our kentucky operations  with specific excess insurance purchased from independent insurance carriers to cover individual traumatic claims in excess of the self insured limits 
for the period june to june  workers compensation coverage was insured through a third party insurance company using a large risk rating plan 
our operations in indiana are insured through a third party insurance company using a large risk rating plan 
our operations in west virginia are fully insured with a guaranteed cost policy through a third party insurance company for both workers compensation and employers liability coverage 
we accrue for the present value of certain workers compensation obligations as calculated annually by an independent actuary based upon assumptions for work related injury and illness rates  discount rates and future trends for medical care costs 
the discount rate is based on interest rates on bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was at december  significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our workers compensation obligation would increase by approximately million 
a change in the law  through either legislation or judicial action  could cause these assumptions to change 
if the estimates do not materialize as anticipated  our actual costs and cash expenditures could differ materially from that currently estimated 
our estimated workers compensation liability as of december  was million 
coal miners pneumoconiosis we are required under the federal mine safety and health act of  as amended  as well as various state statutes  to provide pneumoconiosis black lung benefits to eligible current and former employees and their dependents 
we provide for federal and state black lung claims through a self insurance program for our operations in kentucky 
for the period between june and june  all black lung liabilities were insured through a third party insurance company using a large risk rating plan 
our operations in indiana are insured through a third party insurance company using a large risk rating plan 
our operations in west virginia are fully insured with a guaranteed cost policy through a third party insurance company 
an independent actuary calculates the estimated pneumoconiosis liability annually based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
the discount rate is based on interest rates on high quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was at december  significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate by to  all other things being equal  the present value of our black lung obligation would increase by approximately million 
a change in the law  through either legislation or judicial action  could cause these assumptions to change 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  the actual costs and cash expenditures could vary materially from the amount currently estimated 
our estimated pneumoconiosis liability as of december  was million 
defined benefit pension we have in place a non contributory defined benefit pension plan under which all benefits were frozen in the estimated cost and benefits of our non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined annually by independent actuaries  who  with our review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments with comparable maturities 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the obligation was 
significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense was for the period ended december  significant changes to these rates would introduce volatility to our pension expense 
our accrued pension obligation as of december  was million 
reclamation and mine closure obligation the surface mining control reclamation act of establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining 
our asset retirement obligation liabilities consist of spending estimates related to reclaiming surface land and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws 
our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering estimates related to these requirements 
us gaap requires that asset retirement obligations be initially recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
our management and engineers periodically review the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed 
in estimating future cash flows  we considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf 
the discount rate is our estimate of our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
the actual costs could be different due to several reasons  including the possibility that our estimates could be incorrect  in which case our liabilities would differ 
if we perform the reclamation work using our personnel rather than hiring a third party  as assumed under us gaap  then the costs should be lower 
if governmental regulations change  then the costs of reclamation will be impacted 
us gaap recognizes that the recorded liability could be different than the final cost of the reclamation and addresses the settlement of the liability 
when the obligation is settled  and there is a difference between the recorded liability and the amount paid to settle the obligation  a gain or loss upon settlement is included in earnings 
our asset retirement obligation as of december  was million 
contingencies we are the subject of  or a party to  various suits and pending or threatened litigation involving governmental agencies or private interests 
we have accrued the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these claims based upon management s best estimate of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
management does not believe that the outcome or timing of current legal or environmental matters will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our contingencies 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income 
we have also considered tax planning strategies in determining the deferred tax asset that will ultimately be realized 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of the amount of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
we have a valuation allowance of million against our gross deferred tax assets as of december  coal reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data initially assembled by our staff and analyzed by marshall miller associates  inc mm a 
the reserve information has subsequently been updated by our staff 
the updates to the reserves have been calculated in the same manner  and based on similar assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these updates to the reserve estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
a number of sources of information were used to determine accurate recoverable reserves estimates  including all currently available data  our own operational experience and that of our consultants  historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  previously completed geological and reserve studies  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future prices and future operating costs 
reserve estimates will change from time to time to reflect  among other factors mining activities  new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings  and modification of mining plans or mining methods 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances could be material 
in particular  a variance in reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on our annual expense for depreciation  depletion and amortization and on our annual calculation for potential impairment

evaluation of goodwill for impairment goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually  or if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
impairment testing is performed at a reporting unit level 
our goodwill is contained in the midwest segment 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of using a two step approach 
step one compared the fair value of equity for this reporting unit to its carrying value 
we considered the market and income approaches in addition to the market capitalization method  to estimate the fair value of equity for the reporting unit 
the market capitalization approach is based on allocating the company s market capitalization to the company s reporting units based on financial and production matrices 
the market approach was based on a guideline public companies and guideline transactions within the coal industry 
under the guideline public company approach  certain operating metrics from a selected group of publicly traded comparable companies were used to estimate the fair value of equity for the midwest reporting unit 
under the transaction method  recent merger and acquisition transactions for comparable companies were used to estimate the fair value of equity of the midwest reporting unit 
the income approach was based on a discounted cash flow method in which expected future net cash flows were discounted to present value  using an appropriate after tax weighted average cost of capital 
given the market s view concerning the long term uncertainties in the coal industry and the lack of comparable market transactions in the tested segment  it was concluded that the fair value of the equity for the reporting unit should be weighted more towards the market capitalization approach which resulted in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of the equity for the tested reporting unit 
in step two of the goodwill impairment test  we compared the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
in estimating the implied fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit  we assigned the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
as a result of the goodwill impairment test  we wrote off million of goodwill in the midwest segment to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value 
subsequent to this write off  we have no remaining goodwill 
evaluation of long lived assets for impairment long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues and expenses  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we did not recognize any impairment charges on long lived assets during the periods presented 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of whether an impairment exists in our long lived assets 
the following assumptions are key to our future cash flows expected to be generated by the tested assets we make assumptions about coal production  sales price for unpriced coal  cost to mine the coal and estimated residual value of property  plant and equipment 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal operating budget and are developed on a mine by mine basis 
these projections are updated annually and reviewed by the board of directors 
historically  variances between our projections and actual results have been with regard to assumptions for future coal production  sales prices of coal and costs to mine the coal 
these factors are based on our best knowledge at the time we prepare our budgets but can vary significantly due to regulatory issues  unforeseen mining conditions  change in commodity prices  availability and costs of labor and changes in supply and demand 
while we make our best estimates at the time we prepare our budgets it is reasonably likely that these estimates will change in future budgets  due to the changing nature of the coal environment  economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect the assumptions used in our impairment tests 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  supply and demand for coal  inflation  interest rates  and prices of raw materials commodities  and recent accounting pronouncements see item of part iv  financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies and other information recent accounting pronouncements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   all million of our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate and is not sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
our revolver has floating interest rates based on our option of either the base rate or libor rate 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolver 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps to manage this risk 
a basis point increase in the average interest rate for our floating rate borrowings would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million for each million of borrowings under the revolver 
we manage our commodity price risk through the use of long term coal supply agreements  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
as of march   our commitments for and follow
