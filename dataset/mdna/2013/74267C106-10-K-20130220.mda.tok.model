item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements which accompany this report 
a glossary of insurance terms and phrases is available on the investor section of our website 
throughout the discussion  references to proassurance  pra  company  we  us and our refer to proassurance corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the discussion contains certain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
as discussed under forward looking statements  our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
management considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and the effect of those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses the largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve  and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses also referred to as loss and loss adjustment expenses  incurred losses  losses incurred  and losses 
incurred losses reported in any period reflect our estimate of losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserve established for losses of prior periods 
the estimation of professional liability losses is inherently difficult and is the subject of significant judgment on the part of management 
loss costs  even for claims with similar characteristics  can vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to the nature of the claim and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant family  the outcome of jury trials  the legislative and judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and  for mpl claims  the trend of healthcare costs 
professional liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of significant judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
our reserves are established by management after taking into consideration a variety of factors including premium rates  claims frequency  historical paid and incurred loss development trends  the effect of inflation  general economic trends  the legal and political environment  and the conclusions reached by our internal and consulting actuaries 
we update and review the data underlying the estimation of our reserve for losses each reporting period and make adjustments to loss estimation assumptions that we believe best reflect emerging data 
both our internal and consulting actuaries perform an in depth review of our reserve for losses on at least a semi annual basis using the loss and exposure data of our insurance subsidiaries 
we partition our reserves by accident year  which is the year in which the claim becomes our liability 
as claims are incurred reported and claim payments are made  they are aggregated by accident year for analysis purposes 
we also partition our reserves by reserve type case reserves and ibnr reserves 
case reserves are established by our claims department based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimate of the future loss costs often referred to as expected losses that will be paid on reported claims 
case reserves are decremented as claim payments are made and are periodically adjusted upward or downward as estimates regarding the amount of future losses are revised  reported loss is the case reserve at any point in time plus the claim payments that have been made to date 
ibnr reserves represent our estimate of losses that have been incurred but not reported to us and future developments on losses that have been reported to us 
at a high level our reserving process can be broadly grouped into two areas  the establishment of initial or current accident year reserves and the re estimation of prior year loss reserves 
activity in our net reserve for losses during  and is summarized in the liquidity and capital resources and financial condition losses section that follows 
initial reserve estimates in the current environment  and taking into consideration current claims trends  we believe we are pricing our business today to a loss ratio  however  considerable judgment is required in the pricing of our business and in establishing our initial reserves for a given accident year 
due to the lack of available data for both open and closed claims for the initial 
table of contents accident year  we heavily rely on the loss assumptions that are used in pricing our business 
historically  and at present  we utilize loss ratios that are approximately to percentage points above the ratios we believe we have achieved in our pricing for the current accident year 
we believe this considers inherent risks associated with our rate development process and the historic volatility of professional liability losses the industry has experienced accident year loss ratios as high as and as low as over the past years and produces a reasonable best estimate of the reserves required to cover actual ultimate unpaid losses 
in the current environment this equates to an initial loss ratio of approximately as compared to an average loss ratio of approximately targeted in our pricing 
although we remain uncertain regarding the ultimate severity trend  as discussed in following paragraphs  the consideration we have given to observed lower loss costs has resulted in rate reductions in recent years 
on average  excluding our podiatry business acquired in  we have gradually reduced the premium rates we charge by from to reestimation of prior years loss reserves process the foundation of our reserve re estimation process is an actuarial analysis that is performed by both our internal and consulting actuaries 
the very detailed analysis projects ultimate losses on a line of business  geographic  coverage layer and accident year basis 
the procedure is intended to balance the use of the most representative data for each partition  capturing its unique patterns of development and trends 
in all there are approximately different partitions of our business for purposes of this analysis 
we believe that the use of consulting actuaries provides an independent view of our loss data as well as a broader perspective on industry loss trends 
the analysis performed by the consulting actuaries analyzes each partition of our business in a variety of ways and uses multiple actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses  including bornhuetter ferguson paid and reported method paid development method reported development method average paid value method average reported value method backward recursive development method a brief description of each method follows 
bornhuetter ferguson method 
we use both the paid and the reported bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the paid method assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year initial expected losses being the first established case and ibnr reserves for a specific accident year and partial weight to paid to date losses 
the reported method assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to current expected losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
paid development and reported development method 
these methods use historical  cumulative losses paid losses for the paid development method  reported losses for the reported development method by accident year and develop those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment and case reserving environment for the reported development method  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
average paid value and average reported value methods 
in these methods  average claim cost data paid claim cost for the average paid value method and reported claim cost for the reported value method is developed to an ultimate average cost level by report year based on historical data 
claim counts are similarly developed to an ultimate count level 
the average claim cost after rounding and adjustment  if necessary  to accommodate report year data that is not considered to be predictive is then multiplied by the ultimate claim counts by report year to derive ultimate loss and alae 
backward recursive development method 
this method is an extrapolation of the movements in case reserve adequacy in order to estimate unpaid loss costs 
historical data showing incremental changes to case reserves over progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the ratio of case reserve values at successive maturities 
historical claims payment data showing the additional payments in progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the portion of a case reserve paid in the following period 
starting from the most mature period  after which all of the case reserve is paid and the case reserve is exhausted  the next prior ultimate development factor for the prior case reserve can be calculated as the case factor times the established ultimate development factor plus the paid factor 
for each successive prior maturity  the ultimate 
table of contents development factor is calculated similarly 
the result of multiplying the ultimate development factor times the case reserve is the total indicated unpaid amount 
generally  methods such as the bornhuetter ferguson method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis 
as time progresses and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year  we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods  as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data 
these methods emphasize different aspects of loss reserve estimation and provide a variety of perspectives for our decisions 
certain of the methodologies utilized to estimate the ultimate losses for each partition of our reserves consider the actual amounts paid 
paid data is particularly influential when a large portion of known claims have been closed  as is the case for older accident years 
in selecting a point estimate for each partition  management considers the extent to which trends are emerging consistently for all partitions and known industry trends 
thus  actual  rather than estimated severity trends are given consideration 
when actual severity trends are lower than those estimated at the time that reserves were previously established  the recognition of favorable development is indicated 
this is particularly true for older accident years where our actuarial methodologies give more weight to actual loss costs severity 
the various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period 
in addition  we perform statistical reviews of claims data such as claim counts  average settlement costs and severity trends when establishing our reserves 
we utilize the selected point estimates of ultimate losses to develop estimates of ultimate losses recoverable from reinsurers  based on the terms and conditions of our reinsurance agreements 
an overall estimate of the amount receivable from reinsurers is determined by combining the individual estimates 
our net reserve estimate is the gross reserve point estimate less the estimated reinsurance recovery 
use of judgment even though the actuarial process is highly technical  it is also highly judgmental  both as to the selection of the data used in the various actuarial methodologies eg  initial expected loss ratios and loss development factors and in the interpretation of the output of the various methods used 
each actuarial method generally returns a different value and for the more recent accident years the variations among the various methodologies can be significant 
for each partition of our reserves  the results of the various methods  along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as closed with and without indemnity ratios  claim severity trends  the expected duration of such trends  changes in the legal and legislative environment and the current economic environment  are used to develop a point estimate based upon management judgment and past experience 
the process of selecting the point estimate is based upon the judgment of management taking into consideration the actuarial methods and other environmental factors discussed previously 
for each partition of our reserves  we select a point estimate with due regard for the age  characteristics and volatility of the subset of the business  the volume of data available for review and past experience with respect to the accuracy of estimates 
the series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses 
given the historical volatility of the mpl line of business we are cautious in giving full credibility to emerging trends that  when more fully mature  may lead to the recognition of either favorable or adverse development of our losses 
there may be trends  both positive and negative  reflected in the numerical data both within our own information and in the broader mpl marketplace that mitigate or reverse as time progresses and additional data becomes available 
over the past several years the most influential factor affecting our analysis of reserves has been the changes  or lack thereof  in the severity of claims 
severity is defined as the average cost of resolving claims 
the severity trend assumption is a key assumption for both pricing models and actuarial estimation of reserves 
the severity trend is an explicit component of our pricing models  whereas in our reserving process the severity trend impact is implicit 
our estimate of this trend and our expectations about changes in this trend impact a variety of factors  from the selection of expected loss ratios to the ultimate point estimates established by management 
because of the implicit and wide ranging nature of severity trend assumptions on the loss reserving process it is not practical to specifically isolate the impact of changing severity trends 
however  because severity is an explicit component of our pricing process we can better isolate the impact that changing severity can have on our loss costs and loss ratios as regards our pricing models 
our current pricing model assumes a severity trend of to in most states and lines of business 
if the severity trend were to be higher by percentage point  the impact would be an increase in our expected loss ratio of percentage points 
an increase in the severity trend of percentage points would result in a percentage point increase in our expected loss ratio 
due to the long tailed nature of mpl claims and the previously discussed historical volatility of loss costs  selection of a severity trend assumption is a subjective process that is inherently likely to prove inaccurate over time 
given this long tail and the previously discussed historical volatility of loss costs  we are generally cautious in making changes 
table of contents to the severity assumptions within our pricing model 
also of note is that all open claims and accident years are generally impacted by a change in the severity trend  which compounds the effect of such a change 
from to both our internal and consulting actuaries have observed an unprecedented reduction in the frequency of claims or number of claims per exposure unit that cannot be attributed to any single factor  which has complicated the selection of an appropriate severity trend for our pricing models 
it has also made it more challenging to factor severity into the various actuarial methodologies discussed above 
we believe that much of the reduction in claim frequency is the result of a decline in the filing of frivolous lawsuits that have historically been dismissed or otherwise result in no payment of indemnity on the part of our insureds 
with fewer frivolous claims being filed we expect that the claims that are filed have the potential for greater average losses  or greater severity 
as a result  we cannot be certain as to the impact this decline will ultimately have on the average cost of claims 
based on a weighted average of payments  only are resolved after eight years for a given accident year 
due to this long tail  it can take several years before we are able to determine what impact  if any  has resulted from the decline in frequency and whether there is a related increase in severity 
loss development we recognized net favorable development related to prior accident years of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  in support of our concern that the decline in frequency will result in a higher severity trend  we have seen our closed with indemnity payment ratio ie  the number of claims closed with an indemnity or loss payment as compared to the total number of closed claims increase from in to in while this trend has been in keeping with our expectations  the anticipated increase in severity incorporated into our loss assumptions has not occurred 
rather  we have experienced lower than expected severity which has been the primary driver of the favorable development recognized in recent years 
the following tables present additional information about our loss development estimated ultimate losses  net of reinsurance established ultimates in thousands n a n a n a prior to amounts shown for exclude ultimates associated with the reserves assumed in due to a business combination 
table of contents reserve development  favorable unfavorable in thousands n a n a n a prior to an extended period of time is required to get a clear estimate of the loss cost for a given accident year 
as an example  looking at the accident year  we had resolved of the known claims by the end of  of the known claims by the end of  and of the known claims by the end of these statistics are based on the number of reported claims  since many non meritorious claims are resolved early  percentages of ultimate loss payments known at the same points in time are considerably lower 
a similar pattern can be seen in each open accident year as demonstrated in the table below 
historically we have resolved more than of our physician and hospital professional liability claims with no indemnity payment and generally these claims are the first to be resolved 
as an accident year matures  the number of claims resolved with indemnity payments progressively increases 
in a similar fashion  we typically expend more in loss adjustment expenses legal fees as claims mature 
the following table represents the percentage of known mpl claims closed december accident year n a n a n a based upon the additional claims closed during  and  as shown above  and the continuation of better than expected severity trends  management reduced its expected ultimate losses in each of these years resulting in the recognition of corresponding amounts of favorable development in the income statements of those periods 
at december  management reserve estimates for the three most recent prior accident years which have closed claim percentages below were more heavily influenced by the initial reserves estimates set for these years  while estimates for older accident years with higher percentages of closed claims were more heavily influenced by the more moderate severity trend observed during the period  particularly with regard to claims closed during the period 
at december  and the continued lack of increase in the severity trend  in spite of the increase in the ratio of claims closed with indemnity  influenced management judgment both in regard to the older accident years where this trend has more fully played out and in regard to the more recent accident years 
the increased favorable development recognized in as compared to is largely attributable to the initial effect of giving greater consideration to the moderated severity trend 
management continued to reflect approximately the same level of consideration of the moderated trend in its estimate of the reserve required at december   however  the effect was not as pronounced in as that initially recorded in this can be seen in looking at both the absolute amount of favorable reserve development recognized for the less developed accident years as well as the size of such development when compared to established ultimates for those same accident years at the end of the preceding calendar year 
the following table provides this information for years ended december   and with respect to the three then most recent prior accident years 
table of contents in millions prior accident years net favorable development recognized for the specified years development as a of established ultimates  prior calendar year end variability of loss reserves as previously noted  the number of data points and variables considered and the subjective process followed in establishing our loss reserve makes it impractical to isolate individual variables and demonstrate their impact on our estimate of loss reserves 
however  to provide a better understanding of the potential variability in our reserves  we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point net reserve estimates for our professional liability business assuming different confidence levels 
the ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes 
the aggregation of this data takes into consideration the correlation among our geographic and specialty mix of business 
the result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition 
we have used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an and confidence interval for the potential outcome of our net reserve for losses 
the high and low end points of the distributions are as follows low end point carried net reserve high end point confidence level billion billion billion confidence level billion billion billion any change in our estimate of net ultimate losses for prior years is reflected in net income in the period in which such changes are made 
over the past several years such changes have been to reduce our estimate of net ultimate losses  resulting in a reduction of reported losses for the period and a corresponding increase in income 
due to the size of our reserve for losses and the large number of claims outstanding at any point in time  even a small percentage adjustment to our total reserve estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
reinsurance we use insurance and reinsurance collectively  reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay 
we make a determination of the amount of insurance risk we choose to retain based upon numerous factors  including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
we utilize a reinsurance broker to assist us in the placement of our reinsurance program and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
the determination of which reinsurers we choose to do business with is based upon an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to confirm that there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance 
at december   all ceded contracts were accounted for as risk transferring contracts 
our receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our reinsurance programs 
we base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms and conditions of our reinsurance agreements 
our assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer  publicly available financial and rating agency data  our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies  and responses by reinsurers 

table of contents given the uncertainty inherent in our estimates of losses and related amounts recoverable from reinsurers  these estimates may vary significantly from the ultimate outcome 
under the terms of certain of our reinsurance agreements  the amount of premium that we cede to our reinsurers is based in part on the losses we recover under the agreements 
therefore we make an estimate of premiums ceded under these reinsurance agreements subject to certain maximums and minimums 
any adjustments to our estimates of either balances recoverable under our reinsurance agreements or premiums owed under our agreements are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reinsurance balances  an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
the financial strength of our reinsurers and their corresponding ability to pay us may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate 
we have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer as of december   however  periodically  reinsurers may dispute our demand for reimbursement from them based upon their interpretation of the terms of our agreements 
we have established appropriate reserves for any balances that we believe may not be ultimately collected 
should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us  adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations 
such an adjustment has the potential to be material to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded  however  we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity 
investment valuations we record the majority of our investments at fair value as shown in the table below 
the distribution of our investments based on gaap fair value hierarchies levels was as follows distribution by gaap fair value hierarchy december  level level level total investments investments recorded at fair value other valuations total investments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
all of our fixed maturity and equity security investments are carried at fair value 
our short term securities are carried at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
because of the number of securities we own and the complexity and cost of developing accurate fair values  we utilize multiple independent pricing services to assist us in establishing the fair value of individual securities 
the pricing services provide fair values based on exchange traded prices  if available 
if an exchange traded price is not available  the pricing services  if possible  provide a fair value that is based on multiple broker dealer quotes or that has been developed using pricing models 
pricing models vary by asset class and utilize currently available market data for securities comparable to ours to estimate the fair value for our security 
the pricing services scrutinize market data for consistency with other relevant market information before including the data in the pricing models 
the pricing services disclose the types of pricing models used and the inputs used for each asset class 
determining fair values using these pricing models requires the use of judgment to identify appropriate comparable securities and to choose a valuation methodology that is appropriate for the asset class and available data 
the pricing services provide a single value per instrument quoted 
we review the values provided for reasonableness each quarter by comparing market yields generated by the supplied value versus market yields observed in the market place 
we also compare yields indicated by the provided values to appropriate benchmark yields and review for values that are unchanged or that reflect an unanticipated variation as compared to prior period values 
in addition  we compare provided information for consistency with our other pricing services  known market data and information from our own trades  considering both values and valuation trends 
we also review weekly trades versus the prices supplied by the services 
if a supplied value appears unreasonable  we discuss the valuation in question with the pricing service and make adjustments if deemed necessary 
to date  our review has not resulted in any changes to the values supplied by the pricing services 
the pricing services do not provide a fair value unless an exchange traded price or multiple observable inputs are available 
as a result  the pricing services may provide a fair value for a security in some periods but not others  depending upon the level of recent market activity for the security or comparable securities 

table of contents level investments fair values for our equity and a portion of our short term securities are determined using exchange traded prices 
there is little judgment involved when fair value is determined using an exchange traded price 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify securities valued using an exchange traded price as level securities 
level investments most fixed income securities do not trade daily  and thus exchange traded prices are generally not available for these securities 
however  market information often referred to as observable inputs or market data  including but not limited to  last reported trade  non binding broker quotes  bids  benchmark yield curves  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  offers and recent data regarding assumed prepayment speeds  cash flow and loan performance data is available for most of our fixed income securities 
we determine fair value for a large portion of our fixed income securities using available market information 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify securities valued based on multiple market observable inputs as level securities 
level investments when a pricing service does not provide a value for one of our fixed maturity securities  management estimates fair value using either a single non binding broker quote or pricing models that utilize market based assumptions which have limited observable inputs 
the process involves significant judgment in selecting the appropriate data and modeling techniques to use in the valuation process 
for disclosure purposes we classify fixed maturity securities valued using limited observable inputs as level securities 
we also classify as level our investment interests that are carried at fair value based on a fund provided net asset value nav for our interest 
all investments valued in this manner are lp or llc interests that hold debt and equity securities 
at december  interests valued using a fund provided nav totaled million  or of total investments  and were classified as part of our investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries 
investments other valuation methodologies certain of our investments  in accordance with gaap for the type of investment  are measured using methodologies other than fair value 
at december  these investments had a carrying value of approximately million  which represented of total investments  as shown in the following table 
additional information about these investments is provided in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in millions carrying value gaap measurement method other investments investments in lp llcs cost federal home loan bank fhlb capital stock cost other amortized cost total other investments investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries investments in tax credit partnerships equity business owned life insurance cash surrender value total investments other valuation methodologies investment impairments we evaluate our investments on at least a quarterly basis for declines in fair value that represent other than temporary impairment otti 
in all instances we consider an impairment to be an otti if we intend to sell the security or if we believe we will be required to sell the security before we fully recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
otherwise  we consider various factors in our evaluation  depending upon the type of security  as discussed below 
for debt securities  we consider whether we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis of the security  based upon consideration of some or all of the following third party research and credit rating reports  the current credit standing of the issuer  including credit rating downgrades  
table of contents the extent to which the decline in fair value is attributable to credit risk specifically associated with an investment or its issuer  our internal assessments and those of our external portfolio managers regarding specific circumstances surrounding an investment  which can cause us to believe the investment is more or less likely to recover its value than other investments with a similar structure  for asset backed securities  the origination date of the underlying loans  the remaining average life  the probability that credit performance of the underlying loans will deteriorate in the future  and our assessment of the quality of the collateral underlying the loan  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and our intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in assessing whether we expect to recover the cost basis of debt securities  particularly asset backed securities  we must make a number of assumptions regarding the cash flows that we expect to receive from the security in future periods 
these judgments are subjective in nature and may subsequently be proved to be inaccurate 
we evaluate our cost method interests in lps llcs for otti by considering whether there has been a decline in fair value below the recorded value  which involves assumptions and estimates 
we receive a report from each of the lps llcs at least quarterly which provides us a nav for our interest in the lp llc 
the nav is based on the fair values of securities held by the lp llc as determined by the lp llc manager 
we consider the most recent nav provided  the performance of the lp llc relative to the market  the stated objectives of the lp llc  the cash flows expected from the lp llc and audited financial statements of the entity  if available  in considering whether an otti exists 
our investments in tax credit partnerships are evaluated for otti by comparing cash flow projections of the underlying projects generating the tax credits to our recorded basis  and by considering our ability to utilize the tax credits generated by the investments 
we also evaluate our holdings of fhlb securities for impairment 
we consider the current capital status of the fhlb  whether the fhlb is in compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements  and the fhlb s most recently reported operating results 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting salaries which are directly related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal premiums are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred policy acquisition costs each reporting period  and any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period 
prior to our adoption of the new financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on january   we capitalized all internal selling agent and underwriter salary and benefit costs  including costs associated with unsuccessful contract efforts 
adoption of the new guidance had no material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
deferred taxes deferred federal income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the bases determined for income tax purposes 
our temporary differences principally relate to loss reserves  unearned premiums  deferred policy acquisition costs  unrealized investment gains losses and investment impairments 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized 
we review our deferred tax assets quarterly for impairment 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management is required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information as of the measurement period regarding reversal of existing temporary differences  carryback capacity  future taxable income including its capital and operating characteristics and tax planning strategies 
unrecognized tax benefits we evaluate tax positions taken on tax returns and recognize positions in our financial statements when it is more likely than not that we will sustain the position upon resolution with a taxing authority 
if recognized  the benefit is measured as the 
table of contents largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent probability of being realized 
we review uncertain tax positions each period  considering changes in facts and circumstances  such as changes in tax law  interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law  and make adjustments as we consider necessary 
adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense  and settlement of uncertain tax positions may require the use of cash 
at december   our current tax liability included million for unrecognized tax benefits  and million for related accrued interest 
goodwill management evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter 
if  at any time during the year  events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value  we also evaluate goodwill at that time 
we evaluate goodwill as one reporting unit because we operate as a single operating segment and our segment components are economically similar 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit on the evaluation date based on market capitalization and an expected premium that would be paid to acquire control of our company a control premium 
we then perform a sensitivity analysis using a range of historical stock prices and control premiums 
we concluded as of our last evaluation date  october   that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary 
goodwill is recognized in conjunction with acquisitions as the excess of the purchase consideration for the acquisition over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill of million was recognized in related to acquisitions completed during the period

we have sustained our financial stability during difficult market conditions through responsible pricing and loss reserving practices and through conservative investment practices 
we are committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage and to conservatively investing our assets 
we recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and we manage our business to protect our financial security 
we consider a number of performance measures  including the following the net loss ratio is calculated as net losses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated as underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability 

table of contents the combined ratio is the sum of the underwriting expense ratio and the net loss ratio and measures underwriting profitability 
the investment income ratio is calculated as net investment income divided by net premiums earned and measures the contribution investment earnings provides to our overall profitability 
the operating ratio is the combined ratio  less the investment income ratio 
this ratio provides the combined effect of investment income and underwriting profitability 
the tax ratio is calculated as total income tax expense divided by income loss before income taxes and measures our effective tax rate 
return on equity is calculated as net income for the period divided by the average of beginning and ending shareholders equity 
this ratio measures our overall after tax profitability and shows how efficiently invested capital is being used 
growth in book value 
book value is calculated as total shareholders equity at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of common shares outstanding 
this ratio measures the net worth of the company to shareholders on a per share basis 
growth in book value per share is an indicator of overall profitability 
we particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns  both of which directly affect our return on equity roe and growth of our book value 
historically we targeted a long term average roe of to 
given the persistent low interest rate environment which prevails in the united states and the soft pricing environment for our products  the realization of this long term roe target in the next few years will likely prove difficult 
our emphasis on rate adequacy  selective underwriting  effective claims management and prudent investments is a key factor in our achievement of our roe target 
we closely monitor premium revenues  losses and loss adjustment costs  and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses 
our overall investment strategy is to focus on maximizing current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety  liquidity  duration and portfolio diversification 
while we engage in activities that generate other income  such activities  principally insurance agency services  do not constitute a significant use of our resources or a significant source of revenues or profits 
growth opportunities and outlook we expect our long term growth to come through controlled expansion of our existing operations and through the acquisition of other specialty insurance companies or books of business 
growth through acquisition is often opportunistic and cannot be predicted 
we operate in very competitive markets and  in addition to competition from other insurance companies  we are seeing a trend toward the formation of larger medical practice groups and the employment of physicians by hospitals 
frequently  given the size of these organizations  they choose to manage their medical professional liability exposure outside of the traditional insurance marketplace using self insured mechanisms and other risk sharing arrangements 
in response to these trends  we offer products designed to provide greater risk sharing options to hospitals and large physician groups 
we believe our emphasis on fair treatment of our insureds and other important stakeholders through our commitment to treated fairly has enhanced our market position and differentiated us from other insurers 
we will continue to use treated fairly in all of our activities  and we believe that as we reach more customers with this message we will continue to improve retention and add new insureds 
in  we expanded our lines of business in new directions by acquiring medmarc  an underwriter of products liability insurance for medical technology and life sciences companies who also underwrites a book of legal professional liability insurance 
we have also been a consistent acquirer of other physician insurers  most recently ind in  aps in and pica in other acquisitions included an insurer focused on the legal professional liability market and an agency largely focused on the professional liability needs of allied healthcare providers 
we continue to see new opportunities from each of the acquisitions and believe each will provide organic growth through expansion in their existing markets and relationships 
accounting changes we did not adopt any accounting changes during that had a material effect on our results of operations nor are we aware of any accounting changes not yet adopted as of december  that would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

table of contents liquidity and capital resources and financial condition overview proassurance corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
because the holding company has no other business operations  dividends from its operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for its obligations  including debt service and shareholder dividends 
at december   we held cash and liquid investments of approximately million outside our insurance subsidiaries that were available for use without regulatory approval  million of which was pledged as collateral for advances under our credit facility 
our insurance subsidiaries  in aggregate  are permitted to pay dividends of approximately million over the course of without the prior approval of state insurance regulators 
however  the payment of any dividend requires prior notice to the insurance regulator in the state of domicile  and the regulator may prevent the dividend if  in its judgment  payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the insurance subsidiary 
during  our insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of approximately million  including extraordinary dividends of million 
operating activities and related cash flows the principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of premiums collected and net investment income over losses paid and operating costs  including income taxes 
timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses associated with the premiums 
premiums are generally collected within the twelve month period after the policy is written  while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time 
likewise  timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of any associated reinsurance recoveries 
our operating activities provided positive cash flows of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

the premium from two year term policies is included in gross written premium in the period in which the policy is written  but has little effect on timing of premium receipts since half of the written amount is billed in the second term 
tail policies are typically collected in the period written 
reinsurance contracts are generally for premiums written in a specific annual period  but  absent a commutation agreement  remain in effect until all claims under the contract have been resolved 
some contracts require annual settlements while others require settlement only after a number of years have elapsed  thus the amounts paid can vary widely from period to period 
the timing of our net loss payments varies from period to period because the process for resolving claims is complex and occurs at an uneven pace depending upon the circumstances of the individual claim 
the increase in loss payments for primarily reflected a greater number of claims resolved with large indemnity payments  a portion of which was recovered under existing reinsurance agreements 
the additional loss payments were not isolated to any one state or to any specific risk groups 
loss payments made during were included in the data considered by our actuaries and by our management in determining their best estimate of losses incurred during 
table of contents we are party to certain contracts that involve claims handling but do not transfer insurance risk 
as required by gaap  receipts and disbursements for these contracts are not considered as receipts of premium or payments of losses  but rather are considered as deposits received or returned 
these contracts do not constitute a significant business activity for us 
the decrease in cash received for investments primarily reflected the decrease in net investment income as well as timing differences of interest receipts between periods 
the decrease in cash paid for other expenses was principally attributable to non recurring payments of aps integration costs  primarily compensation related  during the net increase in tax payments during was attributable to a million increase in the final payments for the prior fiscal year  partially offset by a million decrease in estimated tax payments for the current year 
there were no federal tax refunds in in refunds approximated million 
gaap requires that excess tax benefits recognized when shares are issued under stock compensation plans reduce operating cash flows and increase financing cash flows in the period the shares are issued 
such excess tax benefits were million greater in as compared to the above increases to tax related outflows were offset by payments of million made in for the and tax years as a result of federal tax return audits conducted by the internal revenue service

the increase in tax payments primarily reflects an increase in estimated tax payments of million during as compared to payments of million made in for the and tax years as a result of federal tax return audits conducted by the internal revenue service  as previously discussed

some contracts require annual settlements while others require settlement only after a number of years have elapsed  thus the amounts paid can vary widely from period to period 
the decrease in losses reflects lower paid losses at our subsidiaries other than pica of approximately million offset by an increase in pica losses paid of million 
the pica increase is principally due to an additional three months of pica activity in the timing of our loss payments varies from period to period because the process for resolving claims is complex and occurs at an uneven pace depending upon the circumstances of the individual claim

losses the following table  known as the analysis of reserve development  presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to the development of our estimates of losses during that time period 
as noted in the table  proassurance has completed various acquisitions over the ten year period which have affected original and re estimated gross and net reserve balances as well as loss payments 
the table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
the gross liability for losses before reinsurance  as shown on the balance sheet  and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table 
we do not discount our reserve for losses to present value 
information presented in the table is cumulative and  accordingly  each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years 
the table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses  it does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 

table of contents the following may be helpful in understanding the analysis of reserve development the line entitled reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables reflects our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense  less the receivables from reinsurers  each as reported in our consolidated financial statements at the end of each year the balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled cumulative net paid  as of reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled re estimated net liability as of reflects the re estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as balance sheet reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of additional liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year the net re estimated liability 
the line entitled net cumulative redundancy deficiency reflects the difference between the previously recorded balance sheet reserve for each applicable year and the net re estimated liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year

table of contents in each year reflected in the table  we have estimated our reserve for losses utilizing the management and actuarial processes discussed in critical accounting estimates 
factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development are primarily related to the extended period of time required to resolve professional liability claims and include the following the mpl legal environment deteriorated in the late s and severity began to increase at a greater pace than anticipated in our rates and reserve estimates 
we addressed the adverse severity trends through increased rates  stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures 
the expectation of increased claim severity was also considered in establishing our initial reserves for subsequent years 
these adverse severity trends later moderated with that moderation becoming more pronounced beginning in we have been cautious in giving full recognition to indications that the pace of severity increase has slowed  but have given measured recognition of the improving trends in our reserve estimates  as discussed more fully under critical accounting estimates reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve 
the favorable development has been most pronounced for years to  since the initial reserves for these accident years were established prior to substantial indication that severity trends were moderating 
we give stronger recognition to a lower severity trend as time elapses and the percentage of closed claims increases 
a general decline in claim frequency has also been a contributor to favorable loss development 
a significant portion of our policies through were issued on an occurrence basis  and a smaller portion of our ongoing business results from the issuance of extended reporting endorsements which has occurrence like exposure 
as claim frequency declined  the number of reported claims related to these coverages was less than originally expected 
activity in our net reserve for losses during  and is summarized below year ended december in thousands balance  beginning of year less receivable from reinsurers net balance  beginning of year reserves acquired from acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance  end of year plus receivable from reinsurers balance  end of year at december  our gross reserve for losses included case reserves of approximately billion and ibnr reserves of approximately billion 
our consolidated gross reserve for losses on a gaap basis exceeds the combined gross reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately billion  which is principally due to the portion of the gaap reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums 
these unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements tail coverage issued without a premium charge upon death  disability or retirement of an insured who meets certain qualifications 
reinsurance we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
we generally reinsure professional liability risks under annual treaties pursuant to which the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention of million per claim  up to the maximum individual limit offered 
historically  the professional liability per claim retention level has varied between and of the first million and between and of claims exceeding those levels depending on the coverage year and the state in 
table of contents which business was written 
large professional liability risks that are above the limits of our basic reinsurance treaties are reinsured on a facultative basis  whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit 
our primary reinsurance agreements are negotiated and renewed annually at october there was no significant change in the cost or structure of the agreements renewed on october   other than we increased the upper limit of our coverage from million to million 
the pricing structure of the additional coverage is consistent with prior pricing for excess coverage 
our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
we utilize reinsurance brokers to assist us in the placement of our reinsurance coverage and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
we base our reinsurance buying decisions on an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate 
the following table identifies those reinsurers for which our recoverables for both paid and unpaid claims net of amounts due to the reinsurer and our prepaid balances are aggregately million or more as of december  reinsurer domiciliary country am best company rating net amounts due from reinsurer in thousands hannover rueckversicherung ag germany a aspen insurance uk  ltd 
united kingdom a transatlantic reinsurance company united states a general reinsurance corporation united states a taxes in december we received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa from the irs which disallows a substantial portion of the loss and loss adjustment expense deductions taken for the and fiscal years and would thereby increase our current tax liability by approximately million 
we believe that our loss and loss adjustment expense deduction was computed in a manner consistent with tax law  our past practices  and the practices of other liability insurers  and we have begun the process of contesting the irs position 
the proposed adjustment represents a temporary timing difference and impacts the timing of deductions  rather than their allowance  and would shift tax from deferred to current tax expense but would not increase total tax expense 
additional tax payments that might be made as a result of the nopa would come out of our cash and investments and could impact future investment earnings  but  except for interest on past due taxes  if any  will not change recorded tax expense 
we have considered this matter in establishing our liability for uncertain tax matters 
we do not know when a final resolution will be reached with the irs  or the extent  if any  to which we might be required to accelerate our tax payments or the amount of interest  if any  we might be required to pay 
in january we made a million protective tax payment to the irs in order to reduce interest assessments should the irs position be fully or partially sustained 
litigation we are involved in various legal actions related to insurance policies and claims handling including  but not limited to  claims asserted against us by policyholders 
these types of legal actions arise in the ordinary course of business and  in accordance with gaap for insurance entities  are generally considered as a part of our loss reserving process  which is described in detail under critical accounting estimates reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve 
we also have other direct actions against the company which we evaluate and account for as a part of our other liabilities 
for these corporate legal actions  we evaluate each case separately and establish what we believe is an appropriate reserve based on gaap guidance related to contingent liabilities

we manage our investments to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations  taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments  including interest payments  dividends and principal payments  as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations 
in addition to the interest and dividends we will receive  we anticipate that between million and million of our investments will mature or be paid down each quarter of the next year and become available  if needed  to meet our cash flow requirements 
the primary outflow of cash at our insurance subsidiaries is related to paid losses and operating costs  including income taxes 
the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments 
to the extent that we may have an unanticipated shortfall in cash we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under existing borrowing arrangements through our credit facility and the fhlb system 
in december we elected to partially fund our acquisition of medmarc by borrowing million from our existing credit facility on a fully secured basis as this allowed us to continue to hold rather than liquidate certain higher yielding securities 
at december   million of the credit facility remains available for use 
given the relatively short duration of our investments  we do not foresee a shortfall that would require us to meet operating cash needs through additional borrowings

the decrease principally reflects the effects of a competitive market place  but also reflected a net decrease of approximately million related to ceded premium owed to reinsurers for prior year coverages 
our net investment result which includes both net investment income and earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased million or 
net investment income decreased during  primarily due to lower yields on our fixed income portfolio and lower average fixed income investment balances 
approximately million of the decrease is due to increased amortization of tax credit investments in net realized investment gains in were approximately million higher than in the improvement was principally attributable to our equity trading portfolio  but also reflected additional gains from sales of fixed maturity securities and lower impairment losses in other income decreased by million in the decrease is primarily attributable to million of other income in that resulted from the confidential settlement of litigation with a service provider 
expenses current accident year net losses decreased by million or in as compared to the decline was principally attributable to a reduction in the number of insured risks  but also reflected lower expected losses for our death  disability and retirement coverages  and the effect of a commutation recorded in we reduced net losses by million and million in and  respectively  as a result of our review of our estimate of net losses incurred for prior accident years 
underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses decreased by million or in as compared to  which reflected lower costs associated with the operations we acquired from aps  offset by additional expense due to recently closed merger transactions  higher compensation costs and the effect of adopting new fasb guidance regarding policy acquisition costs 
we recognized losses of million in related to the repayment of the note payable which was carried at fair value 
ratios our current accident year net loss ratio decreased percentage points in due to changes in the mix of insured risks 
our calendar year net loss ratio was for as compared to for  with the increase reflecting the emergence of a smaller amount of favorable development in our underwriting expense ratio increased percentage points in  principally reflecting the effect of lower net premiums earned in our operating ratio increased by percentage points in  reflecting higher net loss and expense ratios and a lower investment ratio in return on equity was in and in 
table of contents book value per share our book value per share at december  was compared to at december  the increase primarily reflected the effect of our comprehensive income  partially offset by dividends declared during which reduced our book value by per share 
due to the size of our shareholders equity approximately billion at december   the growth rate of our book value per share may slow 
the past growth rates of our book value per share do not necessarily predict similar future results 
non gaap financial measures operating income is a non gaap financial measure that is widely used to evaluate the performance of insurance entities 
operating income excludes the after tax effects of net realized investment gains or losses  guaranty fund assessments  debt retirement gain or loss and the effect of confidential settlements that do not reflect normal operating results 
we believe operating income presents a useful view of the performance of our insurance operations  but should be considered in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with gaap

table of contents premiums written changes in our premium volume are driven by four primary factors our retention of existing business  the premium charged for business that is renewed  which is affected by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase  the timing of premium written through multi period policies  and the amount of new business we generate 
the professional liability market remains competitive with some competitors choosing to compete primarily on price

the premium associated with both years is included in written premium in the period the policy is written  comparison of gross written premium between successive years reflect volume differences that have no effect on earned premium 
a comparison to is more meaningful  gross written premium for two year term policies in was million 
as compared to  physician premiums declined in the expected timing differences associated with two year policies accounted for more than of the total physician premium decrease 
our retention rate for our standard physician business was for  as compared to for we calculate our retention rate as retained premium divided by all premium subject to renewal 
retention rates are affected by a number of factors 
we may lose insureds to competitors or to alternative insurance mechanisms such as risk retention groups or self insurance entities often when physicians join hospitals or large group practices or due to pricing or other issues 
we may choose not to renew an insured as a result of our underwriting evaluation 
insureds may also terminate coverage because they have left the practice of medicine for various reasons  principally for retirement but also for personal reasons or due to disability or death 
charged rates for our renewed physician business averaged higher than the expiring premiums during our charged rates include the effects of filed rates  surcharges and discounts 
despite competitive pressures  we continue to base our rates on expected losses  as indicated by our historical loss data and available industry loss data 
we are committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds  while generating competitive returns for our shareholders 
new physician business written in was approximately million 
our non physician healthcare providers are primarily dentists  chiropractors and allied health professionals 
the decline in premium volume for these coverages was primarily attributable to allied health professionals 
our hospital and facility premiums remained relatively flat in 
table of contents our other premiums are primarily legal professional liability premiums which increased in due to a greater number of insureds 
our non continuing premiums consist of premiums derived from optometry coverages discontinued in early and certain miscellaneous liability coverages which were discontinued in but that continued to produce small amounts of written premium in and we offer extended reporting endorsement or tail coverage to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us  and we also periodically offer tail coverage through custom policies 
the amount of tail coverage premium written can vary widely from period to period 
a large portion of the increase in tail premium in was attributable to a single custom policy issued to a hospital that terminated its self insurance arrangement 
ceded premiums written ceded premiums written compared as follows year ended december in thousands change primary reinsurance agreement  current accident year reduction in premiums owed under reinsurance agreements ascension health certitude program commutation nm other premiums ceded total ceded premiums written ceded premiums represent the amounts owed to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the ultimate amount owed under certain of our reinsurance agreements is variable and is determined by the loss experience of the business ceded  subject to minimums and maximums 
losses incurred for our higher limit coverages are almost fully reinsured and were estimated to be lower for the accident year than for the accident year 
as a result  our estimate of ceded premium owed under our primary reinsurance agreements for the current accident year was lower in many years may elapse before all losses recoverable under a reinsurance agreement are known 
in the intervening periods  amounts owed are estimated 
premiums ceded for the current period includes both our estimate of premiums owed under reinsurance agreements of the current period and changes to our previous estimate of premiums owed under reinsurance agreements of prior periods 
in both and  we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross losses within our reinsured layers of coverage  as well as the related reinsurance recoveries and premiums ceded

the commutation reduced ceded premium  on both a written and an earned basis  by million and reduced reinsurance recoveries by approximately million 
we reinsure most of our mpl coverages under a single reinsurance agreement that is renewed annually referred to as our primary reinsurance agreement 
professional liability offered to dentists  allied health professionals  certain smaller facilities as well as higher limit mpl coverages were reinsured under separately negotiated contracts until october   but thereafter are covered by our primary reinsurance agreement 
amounts due to reinsurers under these separate contracts are included along with legal professional liability in the preceding table as other premiums ceded

because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
generally  our policies carry a term of one year  but as discussed above  we renew certain policies with a two year term 
tail coverage premiums are generally earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
additionally  ceded premium changes due to commutations or changes to estimates of premiums owed under reinsurance agreements are fully earned in the period of change 
premiums earned were lower in  as compared to  principally due to the pro rata effect of lower non tail physician premiums written during the preceding twelve months  partially offset by higher tail premiums written and earned in components of the change in premiums ceded earned during are detailed in the following table ceded premiums earned increase decrease versus in thousands year ended december primary reinsurance agreement  current accident year reduction in premiums owed under reinsurance agreements ascension health certitude program commutation all other factors net increase decrease see discussions under ceded premiums written for further information

our tax credit partnerships reduced our tax expenses by approximately million during the year ended december   while we recognized million of pre tax amortization million after tax on these investments as noted in the table above 
non gaap financial measure tax equivalent investment result we believe that to fully understand our investment returns it is important to consider the current tax benefits associated with certain investments  therefore  we impute a pro forma tax equivalent investment result by adjusting the current tax benefit into the amount of investment income a taxable investment would need to produce to fairly compare to an investment with preferential tax treatment 
we believe this better reflects the economics of our decision to invest in certain asset classes that are either taxed at lower rates and or result in reductions to our current federal income tax expense

we recognized impairments of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  related to an interest in an llc classified as a part of other investments which we accounted for using the cost method 
the llc announced in that it planned to convert to a publicly traded investment fund and we impaired the investment to the nav reported by the fund 
the conversion occurred during the second quarter of we substantially increased the size of our equity trading portfolio over the previous year 
unrealized trading portfolio gains reflect higher average balances in our portfolio and an overall improvement in stock market yields 
gains losses from changes in the fair value of liabilities were entirely attributable to our note payable and related interest rate swap  both of which we repaid in july for more information  see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income other income is comprised primarily of commission and fee income from our agency operations  other fee revenues  rental income and other miscellaneous revenues 
the revenue is not a principal source of income and often varies among periods 
the decrease in as compared to primarily reflected other income of million recognized in related to a confidential settlement of litigation with a service provider and a gain of approximately million recognized on the sale of a building in losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for claims made policies  which represent over of the company s business  the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the best measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period  since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 

table of contents the following table summarizes calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december in millions change change current accident year prior accident years calendar year net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
our current accident year net loss ratios for the years ended december  and compare as follows year ended december change current accident year net loss ratio  excluding other listed factors effect attributable to change in our estimate of the reserve for death  disability and retirement reduction in premiums owed under reinsurance agreements commutation tail coverages current accident year net loss ratio  as reported the decrease in our current accident year net loss ratio reflects the following in we decreased our loss reserves related to death  disability and retirement ddr coverage endorsements provided to our insureds while in we increased loss reserves for this coverage 
the reserve for ddr is actuarially estimated and is affected by changes in the number of insureds expected to benefit from the coverage endorsement 
net earned premium in both and was increased by reductions to amounts owed under reinsurance agreements see net premiums earned 
the reductions had a greater effect on the net loss ratio in a commutation recorded in increased the net loss ratio  no commutation was recorded in more of our net earned premium was from tail coverages in this increases our average net loss ratio because we expect higher losses for tail coverages than for our other professional liability coverages 
we recognized favorable loss development related to prior accident years of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  a detailed discussion of factors influencing our recognition of loss development recognized is included in the critical accounting estimates section of item  under the caption reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
information provided includes the amount of development recognized by accident year and the factors considered and judgments made to determine the amount of development recognized 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made  as was the case in both and recoveries we recognized favorable prior accident year loss development of approximately million in and million in related to our reinsured coverage layers generally  losses exceeding million and recognized offsetting reductions to loss recoveries of million in and million in because the reductions exceed other recoveries during each year  recoveries increased rather than decreased net losses for the years ended december  and we similarly reduced our estimates of the premium due to reinsurers by million and million in and  respectively  because the premium due to reinsurers is based in part on amounts recovered

the new guidance affects the timing  but not the amount of acquisition costs ultimately expensed  as the decrease in the expense deferral reduces amortization of policy acquisition costs by the same amount  recognized over the term of the associated successful policies 
our expenses reflect a net increase of approximately million in due to adoption of the new guidance  as we expensed approximately million of policy acquisition costs that under prior guidance would have been deferred to later periods but also recognized amortization expense that was approximately million lower than would have been recognized under previous guidance 
exclusive of the effect of the new fasb guidance  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was million lower in than in while amortization was lower in consistent with the decline in net premiums earned  amortization in was reduced by approximately million related to the acquisition of aps in november due to the application of gaap purchase accounting rules  no asset for deferred policy acquisition costs was recognized as a part of the purchase price allocation of aps  consequently  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in was reduced 
on a sporadic basis our expenses are reduced by recoveries related to the settlement of litigation 
recoveries in were approximately million lower and thus expenses on a net basis were higher than in costs associated with the operations acquired from aps  primarily compensation costs  were approximately million lower in as compared to higher stock compensation and bonus costs in as compared to as well as additional costs incurred related to the enhancement of our customer service capabilities increased our expenses by approximately million

our underwriting expense ratio decreased percentage points  reflecting a lower ratio associated with the business acquired from aps and an increase in net premiums earned that is related to favorable development of prior year loss reserves 
our operating ratio declined in by percentage points  reflecting improved net loss and expense ratios partially offset by lower net investment income 
return on equity is for and for book value per share our book value per share at december  is compared to at december  the increase primarily reflects the effect of our income and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from an increase in the net unrealized gain on our investments

trading portfolio losses during reflect the overall decline in stock market yields  further impacted by higher average balances in our portfolio in as compared to fair value adjustments are attributable to our election of fair value treatment for both the note payable and the related interest rate swap  as discussed in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income other income is comprised primarily of commission and fee income from our agency operations  other fee revenues  rental income and other miscellaneous revenues 
the revenue is not a principal source of income and often varies among periods 
during  we recognized other income of million related to a confidential settlement of litigation with a service provider 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to a gain of approximately million recognized on the sale of a building in losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for claims made policies  which represent over of the company s business  the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
for occurrence policies  the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the best measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
the following table summarizes calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 

table of contents net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december in millions change change current accident year pra all other aps acquisition consolidated prior accident years pra all other aps acquisition consolidated calendar year pra all other aps acquisition consolidated net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned as compared to  our current accident year net loss ratio reflects a decrease attributable to higher earned premiums resulting from the re estimation of amounts due to reinsurers discussed further under the header premiums  the effect of which was partially offset by a ratio increase attributable to coverages provided to qualified insureds for death  disability and retirement ddr 
we recognized favorable development related to prior accident years of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  detailed information regarding the development recognized is included in the critical accounting estimates section of item  under the caption reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
information provided includes the amount of development recognized by accident year and the factors considered and judgments made to determine the amount of development recognized 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made  as was the case in both and recoveries we recognized favorable prior accident year loss development of approximately million in and million in related to our reinsured coverage layers generally  losses exceeding million and recognized offsetting reductions to loss recoveries of million in and million in because the reduction exceeds all other recoveries for the period  recoveries increase rather than decrease net losses for the year ended december  we similarly reduced our estimates of the premium due to reinsurers by million and million in and  respectively  because the premium due to reinsurers is based in part on amounts recovered 
underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses the table below provides a comparison of and underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses in thousands change insurance operation expenses pra all other aps acquisition total insurance operation expenses agency expenses 
table of contents insurance operation expenses exclusive of the effect of the aps acquisition  insurance operation expenses decreased by million primarily due to the following amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased by million in primarily due to lower premium volume 
various other expense items reduced operating expense by approximately million 
lower professional fees  principally due to transaction costs incurred in but not in  and an increase in the amount of administrative costs allocated to loss adjustment expense contributed to the decrease 
termination of a captive insurance agreement  managed by proassurance  increased underwriting expense by million 
there was no similar transaction in lower guaranty fund recoupments in increased expenses by million 
expenses associated with aps include salary and benefit expenses of approximately million in that are related to workforce reductions 
aps policy acquisition expenses are approximately million lower in than would be considered normal due to the application of gaap purchase accounting rules whereby the assets for deferred policy acquisition costs were not recognized as a part of the purchase price allocation of aps 
our expense also includes a million reduction that resulted from a settlement of litigation that is unrelated to our normal insurance activities 
underwriting expense ratio the decrease in our consolidated underwriting expense ratio for is attributable to the effect of the acquisition of aps and a million increase in net earned premium resulting from the re estimation of ceded premiums for prior accident year coverages as shown in the following table underwriting expense ratio year ended december change underwriting expense ratio excluding listed factors net earned premiums prior years aps acquisition underwriting expense ratio  as reported our expense ratio computations exclude agency related expenses as discussed below 
agency expenses we have historically operated several non insurance subsidiaries  principally insurance agencies that have generated commission and service fee revenues 
expenses of our agency operations that are associated with the generation of premium revenues by our insurance subsidiaries are included in insurance operation expenses in the above table 
expenses of our agency operations that are directly associated with external commission and service fee revenues are included in agency expenses in the above table 
in  we discontinued most external agency operations 
the decline in agency expenses of million reflects the discontinuation of these operations partially offset by costs incurred related to workforce reductions 

table of contents interest expense the increase in interest expense during reflects commitment fees and amortization of the initial loan costs related to the credit agreement entered into during the second quarter of the credit agreement is discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense by debt obligation is provided in the following table year ended december in thousands change trust preferred securities due surplus notes due may note payable due february revolving credit agreement other taxes our effective tax rate for each period is lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is tax exempt 
other factors affecting our effective tax rate include the following year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income tax credits valuation allowance boli redemption other effective tax rate we continue to invest in tax credit partnerships see equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in we have recognized an expected tax benefit of approximately million related to the credits to be transferred to us by the partnerships 
during we reversed a valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets that were capital in character 
we determined that it was more likely than not that sufficient sources of taxable capital income would be available in future periods to allow us to fully utilize the deferred tax assets 
a partial redemption of our boli increased tax expense in by approximately million  there were no boli redemptions during although our effective tax rate is consistent between and  current tax expense increased by approximately million in in we recorded a current liability of million including interest of million for unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
certain of the securities are held in an unrealized loss position  we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell any of the debt securities held in an unrealized loss position before its anticipated recovery 
the following table summarizes estimated changes in the fair value of our available for sale fixed maturity securities for specific hypothetical changes in interest rates by asset class at december  and december  there are principally two factors that determine interest rates on a given security market interest rates and credit spreads 
as different asset classes can be affected in different ways by movements in those two factors  we have broken out our portfolio by asset class in the following table 
interest rate shift in basis points december  current fair value in millions us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations state and municipal bonds corporate debt asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities duration us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations state and municipal bonds corporate debt asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities december  fair value in millions us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations state and municipal bonds corporate debt asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities duration us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations state and municipal bonds corporate debt asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities 
table of contents computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from the projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  was on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant interest rate sensitivity due to its short duration 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december   of our fixed maturity securities were rated investment grade as determined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros  such as am best  fitch  moody s and standard poor s 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on our fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  investment grade securities  in spite of their rating  can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
ratings published by the nrsros are one of the tools used to evaluate the credit worthiness of our securities 
the ratings reflect the subjective opinion of the rating agencies as to the credit worthiness of the securities  and therefore  we may be subject to additional credit exposure should the rating prove to be unreliable 
we held billion of municipal bonds at december  we require the bonds that we purchase to meet our credit criteria on a stand alone basis 
as of december   on a stand alone basis  our municipal bonds had a weighted average rating of aa 
we also have exposure to credit risk related to our receivables from reinsurers 
our receivables from reinsurers with regard to both paid and unpaid losses approximated million at december  and million at december  we monitor the credit risk associated with our reinsurers using publicly available financial and rating agency data 
equity price risk at december  the fair value of our investment in common stocks was million 
these securities are subject to equity price risk  which is defined as the potential for loss in fair value due to a decline in equity prices 
the weighted average beta of this group of securities was 
beta measures the price sensitivity of an equity security or group of equity securities to a change in the broader equity market  in this case the s p index 
if the value of the s p index increased by  the fair value of these securities would be expected to increase by to million 
conversely  a decrease in the s p index would imply a decrease of in the fair value of these securities to million 
the selected hypothetical changes of plus or minus do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios and are used for illustrative purposes only
