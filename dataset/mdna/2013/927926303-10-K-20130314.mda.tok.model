reclamation we generally will be required to mitigate long term environmental impacts by stabilizing  contouring  re sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed 
these reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans  which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
government regulation our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national  state  provincial and local laws and regulations in the united states  mexico  australia  indonesia and other jurisdictions  which govern prospecting  development  mining  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection of the environment  mine safety  hazardous substances and other matters 
we have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses  permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining  health  safety and environmental statutes and regulations in the united states  mexico  indonesia  australia and the other jurisdictions in which we operate 
there are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations 
for a more detailed discussion of the various government laws and regulations applicable to our operations and potential negative effects of these laws and regulations  see the section heading item a 
risk factors below 
environmental regulation our gold projects are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment 
these laws are continually changing and  in general  are becoming more restrictive 
our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment 
we believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
changes to current local  state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and or reclamation costs 
although we are unable to predict what additional legislation  if any  might be proposed or enacted  additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects 
during  none of our project sites had any material non compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental regulations 
competition we compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition  exploration  financing and development of gold properties 
there is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities  some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources than we have 
as a result  we may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices 
we use consultants and compete with other mining companies for the man hours of consulting time required to complete our studies 
we also compete with other mining companies for mining engineers  geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry and for exploration and development equipment and services 
we believe no single company has sufficient market power to affect the price or supply of gold in the world market 
gold price history the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors all of which are beyond our control  such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation  recession  fluctuation in the relative values of the us dollar and foreign currencies  changes in global and regional gold demand and the political and economic conditions

risk factors 
an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company or otherwise associated with an investment in our securities 
additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
operating risks our mt 
todd gold project requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all 
the construction and operation of our mt 
todd gold project will require significant capital 
our ability to raise sufficient capital will depend on several factors  including a favorable feasibility study  acquisition of the requisite permits  macroeconomic conditions  and future gold prices 
uncontrollable factors such as lower gold prices  unanticipated operating or permitting challenges  illiquidity in the debt markets or a further dislocation in the gold mining equity markets as experienced in recent years  could obstruct our ability to finance the mt 
todd gold project on acceptable terms  if at all 
we cannot be assured that our mt 
todd gold project is feasible or that the feasibility study will accurately forecast operating results 
we have engaged independent consultants to prepare a feasibility study on the mt 
todd gold project 
there can be no assurance that the results of the feasibility study will be positive or that such study will be completed when expected 
if the mt 
todd feasibility study is favorable  and if the project can be financed  there is no assurance that actual production rates  revenues  capital and operating costs at mt 
todd will not vary unfavorably from the estimates and assumptions included in the feasibility study 
if we decide to construct the mine at mt 
todd  we will be assuming certain reclamation obligations resulting in a material financial obligation 
the mt 
todd site was not reclaimed when the original mine closed 
although we are not currently responsible for the reclamation of these historical disturbances  we will accept full responsibility if we make a decision to finance and construct the mine 
at that time we will be required to provide a bond in a form satisfactory to the northern territory government in whose jurisdiction the mt 
todd golf project is located that would cover the expense of the reclamation of the property 
in addition  the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation and bonding requirements from time to time 
the satisfaction of these bonding requirements and continuing or future reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital 
we may not be able to get the required permits to begin construction at mt 
todd in a timely manner or at all 
any delay in acquiring the requisite permits  or failure to receive required governmental approvals  could delay or prevent the start of construction of our mt 
todd gold project 
if we are unable to acquire permits to mine the property  then it will have no reserves under sec industry guide and ni  which would result in an impairment and write down of the carrying value of the project 
there may be other delays in the construction of our mt 
todd gold project 
delays in commencement of construction could result from factors such as availability and performance of engineering and construction contractors  suppliers and consultants  availability of required equipment  and availability of capital 
any delay in the performance of any one or more of the contractors  suppliers  consultants or other persons on which we depend  or lack of availability of required equipment  or delay or failure to receive required governmental approvals  or financing could delay or prevent commencement of construction at the mt 
todd gold project 
there can be no assurance of whether or when construction at the mt 
todd gold project will start or that the necessary personnel  equipment or supplies will be available to the company if and when construction is started 
we cannot be assured that we will have an adequate water supply at mt 
todd 
water at the mt 
todd gold project is expected to be provided from a raw water dam and reservoir which is fed by seasonal rains 
drought or drought like conditions in the area feeding the reservoir could limit or extinguish this water supply  and all operations would have to stop until the water supply is replenished 
there may be delays in the permitting and or start of construction of the los cardones gold project  which could affect the timing of future cash receipts 
construction of the los cardones gold project could be postponed due to delays in receiving the required governmental permits  including permits related to the construction of the desalination plant  pipeline  power line  or widening of the public access road  or from factors such as availability and performance of engineering and construction contractors  suppliers and consultants  availability of required equipment and receipt of required governmental approvals 
there can be no assurance of whether or when construction at the los cardones gold project will start or that the necessary personnel  equipment or supplies will be available if and when construction is commenced 
any delay in the performance of any one or more of invecture  the contractors  suppliers  consultants  or other persons on whom we depend  or lack of availability of required equipment  or delay of or failure to receive required governmental approvals  could also delay or prevent the start of construction 
failure to receive required governmental approvals could delay or prevent a million contractual payment due to us by invecture under the earn in right agreement 
in addition  the los cardones gold project will have no reserves as defined by sec industry guide and ni  which could result in an impairment and write down of the carrying value of the project 
we could incur substantial costs or disruptions to our business if we cannot obtain  renew or maintain the necessary authorizations and permits 
in order to conduct our operations  we must obtain authorizations and permits from governmental authorities 
delays in obtaining authorizations or permits  failure to obtain an authorization or permit or receipt of an authorization or permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our gold projects 
for example  in february  the semarnat dismissed  on administrative grounds  our application for a cusf for our los cardones gold project in baja california sur  mexico 
this delayed indefinitely the start of construction of the project  and  ultimately motivated us to involve a resident joint venture partner to manage this permitting process 
the failure to obtain necessary permits could result in an impairment of the carrying value of our projects as the project s will not have mineral reserves under sec industry guide or ni we rely on third parties to fulfill their obligations under agreements 
our business strategy includes entering into agreements with third parties partners which may earn the right to obtain a majority interest in certain of our projects  in part by managing the respective project 
whether or not we hold a majority interest in a respective project  our partner s may i have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to ours  ii exercise veto rights to block actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the project  iii take action contrary to our policies or objectives  or iv as a result of financial or other difficulties  be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the respective joint venture  option  earn in right or other agreement s  such as contributing capital for the expansion or maintenance of projects 
any one or a combination of these could result in liabilities for us and or could adversely affect the value of the related project s and  by association  damage our reputation and consequently our ability to acquire or advance other projects and or attract future co venturers 
our exploration and development operations are subject to evolving environmental regulations 
all phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation 
environmental legislation is becoming more restrictive in some countries or jurisdictions in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
there is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation  if any  will not adversely affect our projects 
currently  we are subject to us federal and state environmental regulations in california  as well as government environmental regulations in australia  mexico and indonesia 
we could be subject to environmental lawsuits 
neighboring landowners and other third parties could file claims based on environmental statutes and common law for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste material into the environment on or around our properties 
there can be no assurance that our defense of such claims would be successful 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition  results of operation  and corporate reputation 
there may be challenges to our title to mineral properties 
there may be challenges to our title to our mineral properties 
if there are title defects with respect to any of our properties  we may be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property 
also  in any such case  the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management s time from ongoing exploration and development programs 
our property interests in mexico and indonesia are subject to risks from political and economic instability 
we have property interests in mexico and indonesia that may be affected by risks associated with political or economic instability in those countries 
the risks include  but are not limited to  military repression  extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates  labor instability or militancy  mineral title irregularities and high rates of inflation 
in addition  changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in mexico or indonesia may adversely affect our business 
we may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation with respect to restrictions on production  price controls  export controls  income taxes  expropriation of property  maintenance of claims  environmental legislation  land use  land claims of local people  water use and mine safety 
the effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted 
financial and business risks a substantial or extended decline in gold prices would have a material adverse effect on the value of our assets and could result in lower than estimated economic returns 
the value of our assets and our future economic returns are substantially dependent on the price of gold 
the gold price fluctuates on a daily basis and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
factors tending to influence prices include gold sales or leasing by governments and central banks or changes in their monetary policy  including gold inventory management and reallocation of reserves  speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold  the relative strength of the us dollar  expectations of the future rate of inflation  interest rates  changes to economic activity in the united states  china  india and other industrialized or developing countries  geopolitical conflicts  changes in industrial  jewelry or investment demand  changes in supply from production  disinvestment and scrap  and forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions 
a substantial or extended decline in the gold price could jeopardize the development of our mt 
todd  los cardones and awak mas gold projects  reduce our existing estimated gold resources and reserves by removing ores from these estimates that could not be economically processed at the lower gold price  reduce the potential for future revenues from our gold projects  reduce funds available to us for exploration with the result that we may not be able to further advance any of our projects  reduce the market value of our gold projects  and reduce the value of our investments in midas gold corp 
and the amayapampa gold project in bolivia 
we have a history of losses  and we do not expect to generate earnings from operations or pay dividends in the near term 
we are an exploration stage enterprise 
as such we devote our efforts to exploration  analysis and development of our projects 
we do not currently produce gold and do not currently generate operating earnings 
we finance our business activities principally by issuing equity and or debt 
we have incurred losses in all periods since  except for the year ended december   during which we recorded non cash net gains 
our historic accumulated deficit totals approximately  as at december  we expect to continue this trend of incurring losses  until one or more of our gold properties becomes a producing mine s  or is otherwise monetized  and generates sufficient revenues to fund all of our operations  including our corporate headquarters 
we have no history of paying dividends and we do not expect to pay dividends or to make any similar distribution in the foreseeable future 
we may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms  if at all 
the exploration and development of our properties  specifically the construction of any mining facilities and commencement of any mining operations  require substantial additional financing 
we will have to raise additional funds from external sources in order to maintain and advance our existing property positions and to acquire new gold projects 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms  and  if additional financing is not available  we may have to substantially reduce or cease operations 
we cannot be certain that any of our exploration and development activities or any acquisition activities will be commercially successful 
substantial expenditures are required to acquire gold properties  to establish mineral reserves through drilling and analysis  to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the ore and to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining 
we cannot be assured that any mineral reserves or mineral resources acquired or discovered will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds invested in them will ever be recovered 
we face intense competition in the mining industry 
the mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases 
some of our competitors are much larger  established mining companies with greater financial and technical resources than ours 
we compete with other mining companies for attractive mining claims  for capital  for equipment and supplies  for outside services and for qualified managerial and technical employees 
if we are unable to acquire attractive mining claims we could lose an opportunity to improve our business 
competition for capital recently reduced the amount of capital available and raising the associated cost 
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital  our exploration and development programs may be reduced in scope or stopped completely 
competition for equipment and supplies could result in shortage of necessary supplies and or increased costs 
competition for outside services could result in increased costs  reduced quality of service and or delays in completing services 
if we cannot successfully attract and retain qualified employees our exploration and development programs may be slowed down or suspended 
the occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability 
we maintain insurance policies that mitigate certain risks related to our operations 
this insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe to be reasonable based on the circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
however  we may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons  in other cases  insurance may not be available for certain risks 
we do not insure against political risk 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured could result in significant costs that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund our business 
a significant loss or liability could force us to reduce or terminate operations on a specific project 
currency fluctuations may adversely affect our costs 
currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our projects as those costs are incurred at the local currency 
the appreciation of the local currencies against the us dollar increases our costs of exploration and development activities in us dollar terms at our projects located outside of the united states 
as a result  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company is likely a passive foreign investment company  which will likely have adverse us federal income tax consequences for us shareholders 
us shareholders of shares of our common stock the common shares should be aware that the company believes it was classified as a pfic during the taxable year ended december   and based on current business plans and financial projections  management believes there is a significant likelihood that the company will be a pfic during the current taxable year 
if the company is a pfic for any year during a us shareholder s holding period  then such us shareholder generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of common shares  or any so called excess distribution received on their common shares  as ordinary income  and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain or distributions  unless the shareholder makes a timely and effective qualified electing fund qef election or a mark to market election with respect to the common shares 
a us shareholder who makes a qef election generally must report on a current basis its share of the net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which the company is pfic  whether or not the company distributes any amounts to its shareholders 
however  us shareholders should be aware that there can be no assurance that the company will satisfy record keeping requirements that apply to a qef election  or that the company will supply us shareholders with information that such us shareholders require to report under the qef election rules  in event that the company is a pfic and a us shareholder wishes to make a qef election 
thus  us shareholders may not be able to make a qef election with respect to their common shares 
a us shareholder who makes the mark to market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the common shares over the taxpayer s basis therein 
this paragraph is qualified in its entirety by the discussion below under the heading certain us federal income tax considerations 
each us shareholder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding the us federal  us state and local  and foreign tax consequences of the pfic rules and the acquisition  ownership  and disposition of common shares 
eepening political unrest in the middle east and north africa  strong economic growth in china  india and other developing economies could have the effect of constraining supplies of oil and other commodities  which could force related prices higher 
a similar trend in labor costs has been observed  resulting mainly from a shortage of skilled labor and growing pressure for the extractive industries to provide compensation commensurate with higher metals prices 
there is also a growing trend for governments to expect more income from their resources in the form of increased royalties  taxes and fees 
these factors undermine the long term viability of the mining industry generally  and potentially reduce and or increase the cost of financing available to new mining projects 
industry risks cost inflation could negatively affect the long term viability of our industry 
operating costs within the gold mining industry have been increasing dramatically in recent years 
deepening political unrest in the middle east and north africa  strong economic growth in china  india and other developing economies could have the effect of constraining supplies of oil and other commodities  which could force related prices higher 
a similar trend in labor costs has been observed  resulting mainly from a shortage of skilled labor and growing pressure for the extractive industries to provide compensation commensurate with higher metals prices 
there is also a growing trend for governments to expect more income from their resources in the form of increased royalties  taxes and fees 
these factors undermine the long term viability of the mining industry generally  and potentially reduce the availability of  and or increase the cost of  financing for new mining projects 
calculations of mineral reserves and of mineral resources are estimates only and subject to uncertainty 
the estimating of mineral reserves and mineral resources is an imprecise process and the accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data  the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting engineering and geological information and estimating future capital and operating costs 
there is significant uncertainty in any reserve or resource estimate  and the economic results of mining an ore deposit may differ materially from the estimates 
feasibility studies are estimates only and subject to uncertainty 
feasibility studies are used to determine the economic viability of an ore deposit  as are pre feasibility studies and preliminary assessments 
feasibility studies are the most detailed studies and reflect a higher level of confidence in the estimated production rates  and capital and operating costs 
generally accepted levels of confidence are plus or minus for feasibility studies  plus or minus for pre feasibility studies and plus or minus for preliminary assessments 
these levels reflect the levels of confidence that exist at the time the study is completed 
subsequent changes to metal prices  reclamation requirements  operating and capital costs may differ materially from these estimates 
regulations and pending legislation involving climate change could result in increased operating costs 
gold production is energy intensive  resulting in a significant carbon footprint 
a number of governments and or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change 
for example  australia passed the clean energy act in that establishes a mechanism to combat climate change by imposing a carbon tax on greenhouse gas emissions and encourages investment in clean energy 
this type of legislation and possible future legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs related to increased energy requirements  capital equipment  environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations

units of measurement are reported in units used by the qualified person in compiling reports on a project  usually  imperial units for properties in the us and metric units for properties outside the us we use the units of measurement as reported by the qualified persons in their respective reports  regardless of property location  in order to correspond to those units as reported by the qualified persons 
cautionary note to us investors this section and other sections of this annual report on form k contain the terms measured mineral resources  indicated mineral resources  inferred mineral resources  proven mineral reserves  and probable mineral reserves as defined in accordance with ni please note the following regarding these terms measured mineral resources and indicated mineral resources we advise us investors that although these terms are recognized and required by canadian regulations  these terms are not defined in sec industry guide and the sec does not normally permit such terms to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the sec 
us investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves 
inferred mineral resources we advise us investors that although this term is recognized by canadian regulations  the sec does not recognize it 
inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence  and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility 
it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category 
under canadian rules  estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of a feasibility study or prefeasibility study  except in rare cases 
the sec normally only permits an issuer to report mineralization that does not constitute reserves as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures 
us investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally minable 
proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves the definitions of proven and probable mineral reserves used in ni differ from the definitions for proven reserves and probable reserves as found in sec industry guide accordingly  our disclosures of mineral reserves herein may not be comparable to information from us companies subject to reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec 
please see cautionary note to us investors regarding estimates of measured  indicated and inferred resources and proven and probable reserves for further discussion on the differences between terms under ni and sec industry guide cautionary note to all investors concerning economic assessments that include mineral resources mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have no demonstrated economic viability 
the preliminary assessment on the guadalupe de los reyes gold project is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves 
there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment at the guadalupe de los reyes gold project will ever be realized

todd gold project  northern territory  australia property description and location in  we acquired the concession rights to the mt 
todd gold project from the deed administrators for pegasus gold australia pty ltd 
pegasus  the government of the northern territory of australia the nt government and the jawoyn association aboriginal corporation jaac 
in  our agreement with the nt government was renewed for a five year period to mt 
todd was an operating mine in the late s  but the project had been closed due to bankruptcy and was held by these organizations 
the failure of the project was primarily a result of inefficiencies in the comminution circuit  poor gold recoveries and low gold prices 
we hold mt 
todd through our wholly owned subsidiary vista gold australia pty 
ltd 
vista gold australia 
the mt 
todd site was not reclaimed when the mine closed in the late s 
liability for the reclamation of the current disturbance remains with the nt government until we make a production decision  are fully permitted to construct the mine  and have arranged the necessary financing for construction 
the project is located kilometers by road northwest of katherine  northern territory  australia  and approximately kilometers southeast of darwin 
access is by existing paved public roads and approximately four kilometers of paved private road 
we control and maintain the private paved road 
the area has a sub tropical climate with a distinct wet season and dry season 
the area receives most of its rainfall between the months of january and march 
temperatures are moderate  allowing for year round mining operations 
topography is relatively flat 
the tenements encompass a variety of habitats forming part of the northern savannah woodland region  which is characterized by eucalypt woodland with tropical grass understories 
surface elevations are approximately to meters above sea level in the area of the previous and planned plant site and waste dump

todd gold project and will be entitled to an annual cash payment  or payment in kind  equal to of the value of the annual gold production from the current mls  and a nsr royalty on other metals  subject to a minimum payment of a per year 
we are required annually to submit a mine management plan that details work to be done on the property 
we have received approval for all work done on the project to date 
further permitting will be required to continue exploration and development  and an environmental impact statement will be required before mine development can start 
the related permitting processes are relatively straight forward and are not expected to impede to a material extent our exploration and future development plans 
any future mining will require an approved closure plan and sufficient surety bonding to fund that closure 
following the bankruptcy in the s  most of the processing equipment and facilities were removed from the site  but basic infrastructure is still in place  including project access control point  a small shop and office  a mill building  and various concrete slabs and floors  as well as a fully functioning tailings impoundment facility that has capacity to store additional mill tailings  and a fresh water storage reservoir 
in addition  a medium voltage power line supplies the site with electrical power  and a natural gas pipeline  used for power generation by the former operators  is still in place 
mt 
todd is located sufficiently close to the city of katherine to allow for an easy commute for workers 
because the mt 
todd site was not reclaimed when the mine closed  the dumps and heap leach pad require ongoing care and maintenance  which we provide 
precipitation on the waste dumps and heap leach pad have resulted in acid rock drainage which is controlled to the extent possible through collection in retention ponds  storage  ph adjustment and controlled release of acidic or treated water into the edith river when water levels are high enough  in accordance with the waste discharge license 
water treatment we completed the installation of a water treatment plant in the treated water was initially to be stored in the existing tailings impoundment facility  but the above average rainfall experienced in the wet season raised the level of water in the tailings impoundment facility which resulted in the suspension of water treatment 
in  we started pumping water from the tailings impoundment facility into the batman pit 
following extensive chemical and toxicological testwork  in we received authorization from the nt government to in situ treat the water stored in the batman pit to neutralize the acidity and to precipitate the contained metals 
in february  we received a waste discharge license from the nt government that authorizes the release of treated water from the mt 
todd site into the edith river 
we estimate that two wet seasons will be required to complete the discharge of water from the pit 
we will have to dewater substantially all of the pit before we start mining operations 
geology  mineralization  and exploration the mt 
todd gold project is situated within the southeastern portion of the early proterozoic pine creek geosyncline 
meta sediments  granitoids  basic intrusives  acid and intermediate volcanic rocks occur within this geological province 
within the mt 
todd region  the oldest outcropping rocks are assigned to the burrell creek formation 
these rocks consist primarily of interbedded greywackes  siltstones  and shales of turbidite affinity  which are interspersed with the minor volcanics 
the burrell creek formation is overlain by interbedded greywackes  mudstones  tuffs  minor conglomerates  mafic to intermediate volcanics and banded ironstone of the tollis formation 
the burrell creek formation and tollis formation comprise the finniss river group 
the finniss river group strata have been folded about northerly trending f fold axes 
the folds are closed to open style and have moderately westerly dipping axial planes with some sections being overturned 
a later north south compression event resulted in east west trending open style upright d folds 
the finniss river group has been regionally metamorphosed to lower green schist facies 
late and post orogenic granite intrusions of the cullen batholith occurred from ma to ma  and brought about local contact metamorphism to hornblende hornfels facies 
the batman pit geology consists of a sequence of hornfelsed interbedded greywackes and shales with minor thin beds of felsic tuff 
bedding consistently strikes at degrees  dipping degrees to degrees to the southwest 
northerly trending sheeted quartz sulfide veins and joints striking at degrees to degrees and dipping degrees to the east are the major controls for mineralization in the batman pit 
the veins are to millimeters in thickness with an average thickness of around to millimeters and occur in sheets with up to veins per horizontal meter 
these sheeted veins are the main source of gold mineralization in the batman pit 
in general  the batman pit extends  meters in length by to meters in true width and has been drill tested to a depth of meters down dip 
the deposit is open along strike and at depth 
the mineralization within the batman pit is directly related to the intensity of the north south trending quartz sulfide veining 
the lithological units impact on the orientation and intensity of mineralization 
sulfide minerals associated with the gold mineralization are pyrite  pyrrhotite and lesser amounts of chalcopyrite  bismuthinite and arsenopyrite 
galena and sphalerite are also present  but appear to be post gold mineralization  and are related to calcite veining in the bedding plains and the east west trending faults and joints 
two main styles of mineralization have been identified in the batman pit 
these are the north south trending vein mineralization and bedding parallel mineralization 
based on our review of the historic project files  we believe that approximately million tonnes grading grams gold per ton and containing  ounces of gold were extracted between and the termination of mining in processing was by a combination of heap leach production from oxide ore and cyanidation of sulfide ore 
the remaining mineralization consists of sulfide mineralization lying below and along strike of the existing open pit  and in hanging wall structures parallel to the main zone in the existing open pit

the january pfs evaluated the viability of a  tonne per day processing facility and the optimized extraction of the identified mineral resource 
the previous pfs was constrained to treating mineralized material  the volume of which would be accommodated in the existing tailings disposal facility  tonnes 
the operating rate in the previous pfs was  tonnes per day of ore compared to the higher  and more economical rate of  tonnes per day considered in the january study 
a new tailings disposal facility would be constructed to accommodate the excess tails from the increased ore reserves in the new pfs 
highlights of the january pfs include increased proven and probable mineral reserves  higher annual gold production  longer project life and improved economics at current and long term estimated gold prices 
the january pfs was evaluated using a three year trailing average gold price of  per ounce

the latter half of the project life benefits from decreases in the required stripping 
pre production capital costs including contingency  owner s costs and working capital are estimated to be  and sustaining capital over the life of the mine is estimated to be  including  for additional tailings storage capacity to be spent starting in year five 
mining  january pfs we planned to extract ore from the mine using conventional open pit mining equipment and techniques 
a waste mining fleet consisting of tonne trucks and cubic meter shovels has been selected to complement the tonne truck and loader ore mining fleet 
we plan to be the owner and operator of the mining fleets and we expect to enter into maintenance and repair contracts for the major mining equipment 
ore will be mined in four pit development phases over a period of years 
waste rock will either be placed in a single waste dump or used for tailings embankment construction 
concurrent reclamation is planned for the lower benches of the waste dump 
processing  january pfs following an extensive review of the plant performance data from previous operators  it was clear to us that there were a number of key reasons why these operations were unsuccessful 
as a result  we undertook mineralogical and metallurgical studies to fully understand the type of ore that would be treated over the life of the proposed mine 
this was followed by laboratory test programs that evaluated the metallurgical process  proposed equipment and the expected performance and cost parameters 
we believe the principal reasons that led to the previous operational failure were ore hardness the plant built by the previous operator was poorly designed to handle the hard ore and failed to produce a satisfactory product or achieve design capacity 
we tested and determined the expected ore hardness and then evaluated various combinations of equipment 
the best combination of equipment involved primary and secondary crushing  tertiary crushing employing high pressure grinding rolls hpgr followed by a large ball mill 
the use of hpgr is expected to result in a product which significantly improves the efficiency of the grinding circuit 
for the base case  the circuit is very simple with a large primary gyratory crusher  a secondary cone crusher  a single hpgr unit and a single ball mill 
hpgr technology is currently being successfully used by newmont mining corporation  at australia s largest gold mine  the million ounce boddington mine in western australia 
the circuit has been designed to reflect the results of leach tests which indicate that the optimum grind size should be passing mesh  coarser than used in previous operations 
metallurgy a number of metallurgical problems were encountered in the past  mostly related to copper minerals in the ore 
our test program focused first on understanding the form and distribution of the copper minerals in the orebody and then on the best metallurgical approach to deal with the copper 
in the mineralogical review it became apparent that the form of the copper minerals changes with depth 
in the upper part of the orebody  mostly mined out by previous operators  the copper existed mainly as secondary copper minerals  these minerals are very soluble in cyanide which greatly increased the expense and reduced the efficiency of leaching 
the remaining ore contains mainly primary copper minerals like chalcopyrite which generally has a very minor effect on leaching and cyanide consumption 
the tests we undertook on representative samples of the ore to be mined showed that whole ore leaching combined with a carbon in pulp recovery circuit yields acceptable recoveries of 
the proposed plant would have a design capacity of  tonnes per day and was designed to be simple  efficient and easy to maintain 
the proposed flowsheet indicates that following grinding  the slurried ore will be sized by cyclones  thickened  pre conditioned  and then leached in tanks prior to recovery in a hybrid carbon in pulp circuit 
gold will be stripped from the carbon and precipitated in an electrowinning cell prior to refining into dore bars 
the tailings will be detoxified using the so air process and deposited in the existing tailings impoundment facility 
further contributing to lower costs  the proposed project will self generate power using low cost natural gas which can be supplied to the site via the existing natural gas pipeline 
the project also includes plans to produce lime from near by limestone deposits  thereby significantly reducing the supply cost for this reagent 
infrastructure  january pfs the mt 
todd gold project site has existing infrastructure which includes a fresh water storage reservoir with sufficient capacity to sustain the proposed operation  paved access roads  concrete foundations for some of the crushing circuit  a natural gas pipeline and an electrical power line 
power will be generated on site using a gas turbine generator which is included in the project capital 
the power plant is designed to have excess capacity to meet higher loads during large equipment starting up 
excess power during operations could be sold into the grid further reducing expected costs 
environmental  january pfs the january pfs includes engineering designs for the closure of the mine site following cessation of production 
where practical  concurrent reclamation activities would be undertaken to reduce the time and expense involved in the closure of the site 
the closure plan was designed to meet all requirements for long term reclamation of the site and cost estimates include provisions for monitoring required under applicable law 
economic analysis  january pfs the economic analysis was completed using the three year trailing average gold price of  per ounce and a foreign exchange rate of a 
we also completed sensitivity analyses at gold prices of   and  per ounce 
the   and  sensitivity analyses incorporate the current foreign exchange rate of a

todd feasibility study process  we generated a final pit design based on estimated measured and indicated mineral resources 
subsequently  we determined the limits of an economic pit using estimated measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources 
this economic pit design and the location of inferred mineral resources relative to the feasibility study pit design led us to start a drilling program in november designed to convert estimated inferred mineral resources to estimated measured or indicated mineral resources in areas that could expand the feasibility study pit shape 
the program was completed in november thirty two diamond core holes totaling  meters were completed within the program 
the core was logged  photographed and sampled by employees or contractors under the directions of our vice president of exploration  mr 
frank fenne pg  who is a qualified person within the meaning of ni facilities for the core processing included an enclosed logging shed and a covered cutting and storage area that was fenced in 
both of these facilities were considered to be limited access areas and kept secured when work was not in progress 
the diamond core was boxed and stacked at the rig by the drill crews 
core was then picked up daily by members of the core cutting crew and transported directly into the logging shed 
processing of the core included photographing  geotechnical and geologic logging  and marking the core for sampling 
the core was laid out for the following procedures sample intervals were marked on the core by a member of the geologic staff 
sample intervals were a nominal meter  geotechnical logging was done in accordance with procedures recommended by our geotechnical consulting company  geologic logging was then done by a member of the geologic staff 
assay intervals were selected at this time and a cut line marked on the core 
the standard sample interval was one meter  sample numbers were then assigned and sample tickets prepared 
duplicate sample tickets were placed in the core tray at the appropriate locations  and each core tray was photographed and restacked on pallets pending sample cutting 
the core was then cut using diamond saws with each interval placed in marked plastic bags 
standards and blanks were also placed in plastic bags for inclusion in the shipment 
all of these samples were kept in the secure area until crated for shipping 
samples were prepared and assayed by north australia laboratories  pine creek australia 
second lab check assays were completed by northern territory environmental laboratories intertek group in darwin  australia 
gold grades are based on a gram fire assay method 
updated resource september we announced the results of an updated mineral resource estimate for the batman deposit on september   and the ni technical report was issued on october  the resource update incorporates cores completed in the resource conversion drilling program

project development update october we announced that we have completed a comprehensive analysis focused on optimizing the development plans for the mt 
todd gold project in northern territory  australia 
after a thorough review  management has selected for evaluation a two phased strategy to achieve its development goals and economic objectives 
stage contemplates the construction of a  tpd project using a higher cut off grade g au tonne vs 
g au tonne used in all prior vista analysis  with lower grade material to be stockpiled 
stage would involve an expansion to  tpd after payback of initial capital and contemplates a reduction in the cut off grade to g au tonne and the processing of stockpiled material from stage this two phased strategy enables us to minimize initial capital costs and further increase the average grade of material to the mill in the early years of the project to achieve the shortest possible payback period 
it also provides the opportunity to achieve a increase in project scale with modest additional capital expenditures to allow us to take advantage of mt 
todd s large and growing resource base 
additionally  we intend to complete a preliminary feasibility study in the first quarter of that evaluates this development strategy 
we expect to complete a feasibility study for the project in the second quarter of  subject to the results of the preliminary feasibility study 
exploration potential based on airborne geophysical survey data  we have identified five magnetic targets within our controlled land holdings surrounding the batman pit 
the targets are distinct magnetic highs located within sedimentary rocks that should have a low magnetic signature 
these features are similar to those at mt 
todd  which  as a result of the included pyrrhotite  exhibits a strong magnetic high 
in september  we completed our review of the geology and calculated a mineral resource estimate in accordance with cim standards 
the mineral resource estimate was conducted by tetra tech mm inc under the direction of mr 
john rozelle  at the time an independent qualified person as defined by ni using standard industry software and resource estimation methodology  who joined vista as vice president  technical services in may 
the quigleys deposit is located km northeast of the batman pit at our mt 
todd gold project 
mineralization at the quigleys deposit is interpreted to occur within a series of mineralized shears that strike north northwest and dip to degrees to the west 
the main shear extends for nearly one kilometer along the strike and has been drilled to a vertical depth of meters 
the mineral resource estimate has been defined by drill holes drilled by pegasus and billiton australia gold pty 
ltd 
in the late s through the mid s 
tetra tech reviewed the integrity of the drill hole database and developed a computer model to estimate and classify the estimated mineral resources 
the model reflected tetra tech s geological interpretation of the deposit  which constrained the mineralization to the shear zones using geological information and assays from  samples obtained from the drilling 
lower grade  erratic mineralization in the hanging wall of the shears has not been included in the mineral resource estimate 
sampling and assaying was done under the supervision of prior operators in conjunction with evaluation of the batman pit and are discussed in the pfs and the pea  as part of the overall project sampling and assaying methodology 
based on tetra tech s resource analysis  at a cut off grade of grams of gold per tonne  under sec industry guide guidelines  mineralized material for the quigleys deposit is estimated at  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne 
under cim definition standards  at the same cut off grade of grams gold per tonne  measured mineral resources are estimated at  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne  indicated mineral resources are estimated at  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne and inferred mineral resources are estimated at  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne 
cautionary note to us investors see the section heading cautionary note to united states investors regarding estimates of measured  indicated and inferred resources and proven and probable reserves above 
the focus of the geology staff in has been on the development drilling and exploration on the exploration licenses has been limited to meeting commitments to maintain the licenses in good standing 
in late november  a single diamond drill hole was completed on the target before the onset of the wet season 
sd was drilled at an angle across the target zone to a depth of m 
although the hole did not intersect significant ore grade mineralization  assay results were encouraging  and we believe that additional drilling is warranted 
the hole intersected zones of intensely silicified greywackes and shales with minor sheeted quartz veins 
the alteration and veining is remarkably similar to that observed at the batman deposit in the vicinity of the core zone 
the greywacke units are coarser grained than at batman  but the frequency of lithological changes and alteration types are all very similar 
sulfides are present within the quartz veining and as disseminated blebs within intensely silicified siltstones 
common sulfide minerals include pyrite  pyrrhotite  chalcopyrite  and arsenopyrite with traces of galena  sphalerite and bornite 
veining has a steep dip to the east  similar to batman  but appears richer in base metals 
disseminated sulphides are also more abundant  while the vein density is not as intense as batman 
during  we completed a detailed ground magnetic survey at the golden eye target to refine the airborne data 
we continued mapping and geochemical exploration at the snow drop target 
based on the results  we drilled one angle core hole to a depth of meters across the target 
the hole intersected thick zones of anomalous gold and gold pathfinder elements and additional drilling is planned in as much as  meters of core drilling on the els is planned in  depending on drill results 
drill targets include quigleys  snowdrop and golden eye 
we plan to raise additional funds to execute this program 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary capital on reasonable terms  if at all 
the mt

guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project  sinaloa  mexico property description and location our guadalupe de los reyes project is located in the state of sinaloa  near the village of guadalupe de los reyes in western mexico  approximately halfway between the cities of mazatlan and culiacan 
the project area is accessed by a kilometer dirt road from cosala  a city of approximately  inhabitants 
the city of cosala is connected to the cities of mazatlan and culiacan by a kilometer paved highway plus kilometers of toll freeway or by small aircraft from a local airstrip to international airports of durango  mazatlan and culiacan 
the project is located in the western foothills of the sierra madre occidental at elevations that vary from approximately meters to  meters 
the topography is moderate to rugged 
climate in this area is arid to semi arid with an average temperature of to degrees celsius 
the average rainfall of approximately  millimeters occurs mostly during the period of june to september in strong storm events that cause flooding along the river beds and frequent interruptions of the road to cosala 
moderate to dense vegetation of bushes and shrubs covers the hill slopes within the project area  in a transition zone that changes from the tropical vegetation towards the lower elevations to that of evergreens and other types of trees at higher topography 
sporadic underground mining of veins in the district occurred from the s until the s  resulting in a reported accumulated extraction of approximately million tonnes of ore with an average grade of gold grams per tonne and silver grams per tonne from the various deposits located within the district 
old  abandoned underground mine workings and relatively small mine waste dumps exist in the area  no tailings ponds are present  and there are no known environmental liabilities on the project

an important consideration is the traditional use of land  which recognizes that mining is the preferred use of the land in and around old mine workings 
most of the surface rights to the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project are held by the ejido tasajera ejido 
in november  we concluded a two year lease for use of the surface with the ejido two gold silver mineral properties adjacent to our guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project 
history from the middle of the s to the s there was limited activity within the guadalupe area that included exploration reconnaissance studies and mining concessions promotions 
in the early s  northern crown mines ltd 
ncm completed a total of  meters of reverse circulation drilling on the concessions 
in  meridian gold  incorporated optioned the project from ncm and completed a due diligence investigation including sample checks and drilling of additional confirmatory holes totaling  meters 
meridian dropped the option with ncm in and ncm subsequently returned all mineral rights to the original concessionaires 
in  we acquired a interest in the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project and a data package associated with the project and general area 
in  we acquired several concessions adjacent to our guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project 
in  we acquired several open fractions within our concession grouping 
this consolidated our ownership of the known mineralization within the guadalupe de los reyes district 
the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project is subject to nsr royalties ranging from 
we hold guadalupe de los reyes through our wholly owned subsidiary minera gold stake sa de sa infrastructure electrical power is available in the village of guadalupe de los reyes  but there may not be sufficient capacity to support a mining operation 
a trade off study between on site power generation and power capacity upgrades will be part of a future feasibility study 
it is anticipated that ground water wells would supply water for any future mine development and that the source of mine personnel would be from nearby villages 
operations personnel would be secured from surrounding villages 
transportation of personnel will be addressed in future feasibility studies 
geology and mineralization the guadalupe de los reyes district is a low sulfidation epithermal gold silver system composed of quartz chalcedony veins  vein stockworks  and breccias hosted within the lower volcanic sequence lvs of the sierra madre occidental 
the lvs is a differentiated section of basalt flows and tuffs that grade upward into andesite tuff 
the andesites are overlain by a complex of dacite to rhyodacite flows and tuffs with related dikes  small stocks and flow domes 
the lvs rests unconformable on a cretaceous granite batholith and is unconformably overlain by the upper volcanic sequence uvs 
the uvs is characterized by thick  tabular  rhyolitic ash flow tuffs that form topographic highs and prominent cliffs 
within the area  there are four major northwesterly and west northwesterly dilational quartz filled fault structures with an aggregate strike length of kilometers 
these structures have displaced the lvs stratigraphy and have been subsequently silicified and infilled with low sulfidation style epithermal gold and silver mineralization 
the vein fault structures have good strike continuity and typically dip from to degrees 
vein widths vary from to meters depending upon the degree of dilation of the fault structure and intensity of silica injection and mineralization 
the mineralogy is dominated by several varieties and periods of silicification with attendant calcite and adularia 
native gold  electrum and acanthite are the primary economic minerals 
sulfide content is very low and typical gold pathfinder elements are only weakly elevated 
most of the historical underground operations in the district were concentrated along the footwall of the veins where the higher grade gold and silver values most often occurred 
however  the more extensive brecciated hanging wall sections of these veins that usually host lower grade  dominantly gold bearing mineralization  were largely ignored 
these hanging wall sections in topographically favorable locations are favorable sites to develop bulk tonnage gold silver deposits 
preliminary economic assessment in march  we announced the completion of a preliminary economic assessment pea for the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project in sinaloa  mexico which evaluated the viability of a  tonne per day  tonne per annum processing facility with positive results 
the guadalupe de los reyes pea was completed by tetratech mm  inc of golden  colorado  pursuant to canadian national instrument standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni

lips  dr 
bryan and mr 
spiller have reviewed and approved the technical and scientific information contained in this report 
previous technical reports contain extensive geologic and technical information related to the deposit  on which this estimate relies 
the last technical report was filed on sedar on november  and is entitled technical report resource of guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project sinaloa  mexico and was issued on november  the pea is intended to provide only an initial review of the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project potential and is preliminary in nature 
the pea includes inferred resources that are considered to be too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves  and there is no certainty that the economic results described in the pea will be realized 
project economics the following table provides details on the project s economics at variable gold price assumptions 
financials discount rate gold silver price assumptions units base case average gold cash cost us oz after tax npv us m irr after tax payback after tax years project concept the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project  as currently envisioned  consists of five small open pits within the guadalupe de los reyes system  all located within approximately km of each other 
conventional open pit methods are recommended for mining the five deposits 
the deposits are typical of a low sulfidation epithermal system with mineralization occurring in westward dipping structural zones that range from a few meters to tens of meters in thickness 
the gold occurs as microscopic sized  free to quartz encapsulated electrum associated with silver sulfides 
historic metallurgic testwork focused on heap leach recovery methods  however vista believes that finer grind size through milling could lead to better recoveries 
vista testwork has focused on gold extraction under a conventional mill and cil circuit and has resulted in an estimated average gold recovery of and a range of silver recoveries  dependent on the specific deposit tested 
mill throughput is assumed to be  tonnes per day or  tonnes per year 
with this assumed production rate  the mine life would be approximately years  with million tonnes of material processed 
the mine would have an overall strip ratio of tonnes of waste rock per tonne of economic mineralized rock 
gold accounts for approximately of the value of the payable metals with silver accounting for the balance 
mineral resources the mineral resources utilized in this pea were announced in november and are contained in a separate technical report that was filed on november  those mineral resources are summarized in the table below

the minimal amount of deep drilling conducted by the company together with historical records indicate that the stockwork of the low sulfidation epithermal vein system that is the host for the deposits evaluated in the pea consolidate into high grade vein systems with widths that could be mined by underground mining methods 
we believe there is a possibility that with time and the appropriate exploration expenditures  a high grade underground mineable resource could potentially be developed 
the guadalupe de los reyes project is without known mineral reserves under sec industry guide and the proposed program at guadalupe de los reyes is exploratory in nature 
for the remainder of  our expenditures on guadalupe de los reyes will be restricted to property holding costs and community support initiatives as the company is primarily focused on the continued evaluation of the mt

history the initial recorded work at los cardones started around when noranda inc noranda completed to core drill holes on the property 
an extensive geochemical program and completion of diamond drill holes were completed in and by imperial metals corporation imc 
in  tymar resources inc tymar acquired of the shares of imc  and subsequently completed a geochemical survey and reverse circulation drill holes 
through a series of name changes and amalgamations  tymar became a wholly owned subsidiary of viceroy resource corp 
viceroy 
echo bay mines ltd 
echo bay entered into an agreement with viceroy in may under the agreement  echo bay spent approximately  on the project through january and earned a interest in the project 
the echo bay work included completion of a feasibility study on the project in based on the feasibility study  a production decision was made 
however  when gold prices quickly fell from over per ounce  which had been the basis of the feasibility study  to less than per gold ounce  echo bay terminated the detailed engineering work then in progress and indefinitely suspended development of the project 
in october  viceroy acquired echo bay s of the project in exchange for the mill that was owned jointly by echo bay and viceroy as joint venture partners  and a net profits royalty  except for two concessions which are outside the limits of the currently designed open pit 
we acquired the project from viceroy in august for a total purchase price of c  the terms of the agreement called for payment of in cash  with c  due at closing and c due one year from closing  and in vista equity units one common share and one warrant to purchase one common share 
infrastructure at the present time  the project area is undeveloped with only several sheds and the drill access roads constructed during the exploration phase 
we maintain an office in the city of la paz and a small warehouse for the storage of drill samples in the town of san antonio 
there is an existing power sub station located kilometers north of the project area 
surface rights have been secured by the purchase of titled land from a landowner in the area  and there is sufficient space on this land for the processing plant and tailings disposal facility 
geology and mineralization the south southeast trending baja peninsula is cut by north trending extensional faults thought to be related to the tertiary extensional environment of the gulf of california and east pacific rise 
at the southern tip of the peninsula is the la paz crystalline complex  made up of cretaceous intermediate to silicic intrusions that cut and metamorphosed early mesozoic clastic and calcareous sedimentary rocks 
the los cardones gold project lies on the northwest flank of the mountain range with picacho sierra la laguna as its most prominent local feature 
this mountain range lies within the la paz crystalline complex 
the crystalline complex is bounded on the west by the la paz fault that transects the peninsula 
while a thick sequence of tertiary volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks crop out west of the la paz fault  erosion has removed both the tertiary volcanic units and the early mesozoic metasedimentary rocks from the los cardones area 
the to kilometer wide  kilometer long todos santos mineral belt  bounded by north trending extensional faults  includes the valle perdido  el triunfo  and san antonio mining districts  as well as los cardones 
a regional north northeast striking fault  mapped for three kilometers north and south of los cardones  has an east trending flexure in its central portion  which is where the los cardones resource is located 
general geology at los cardones consists of diorite roof pendants intruded by a granodiorite batholith with local low and high angle fault zones 
a north east striking  south east dipping low angle silicified fault zone technically a cataclasite is the main host of gold mineralization at los cardones 
movement along this structure has been characterized as reverse  resulting from compression 
secondary  high angle faulting is thought to control the higher grade mineralization at the project 
the known gold mineralized material occupies an inverted u shaped block with an approximate strike length of  meters east west to east northeast  a width of approximately meters down dip  and a thickness averaging about meters  but reaching meters 
the apex of the u is near the center of the proposed pit with the legs forming the east and west pit lobes 
silver occurs in the deposit  but due to the lack of quality assurance and quality control data for the silver assays  a ni compliant silver resource estimate has not been prepared 
metallurgical testing indicates that silver recoveries are variable  but silver production is not included in the feasibility study described below 
it cannot be assumed that any silver will be produced from the los cardones gold project 
feasibility study and mineral resource and reserve estimate in september  we completed a feasibility study under the direction of our independent consultant  srk 
an update of the capital and operating costs and economic analysis of the project was completed on september  the updated study 
the technical report outlining the results of the updated study entitled feasibility study update  ni technical report  vista gold corp  paredones amarillos gold project  baja california sur  mexico dated september   is available on sedar at www

com 
paredones amarillos is a former name for the los cardones project 
the technical portions of the studies contracted directly by vista and supervised by srk were completed by mda  golder associates inc golder  and srk

in connection with the feasibility study and confirmed in the updated study  a mineral resource estimate mineralized material estimate under sec industry guide was completed by mda by or under the supervision of mr 
steven ristorcelli  p 
geo  an independent qualified person as defined by ni the estimate was prepared using industry standard software and estimation methodologies 
there are drill holes in the data base  of which four were drilled by reverse circulation methods followed by core drilling through the mineralized zone were core holes and were reverse circulation holes 
of the drill holes in the data base  drill holes containing  samples were used in the mineral resource estimate 
drill hole spacing in the projected open pit area is approximately meters 
mr 
ristorcelli reviewed available information necessary for the preparation of the resource estimate  including sampling  analytical  drilling and geologic 
the only information available in respect of sampling programs relates to work that was completed by echo bay mines ltd 
echo bay  a former operator of the project and subsequently by vista gold 
the sampling programs completed by vista gold were either completed after the resource model was prepared or were conducted outside the area of the reported resource and were not included in the preparation of the resource model 
most of the drilling at the los cardones gold project has been reverse circulation drilling  and the majority of the reverse circulation drill sampling was completed on wet samples 
echo bay s reverse circulation drill samples were collected in a cyclone that contained both a vertical and a side discharge port 
samples from both ports appeared to be representative of each one meter interval  although as observed in the field  samples from the vertical port were slightly heavier 
estimated sample weights were to kilograms 
samples were collected in five gallon plastic pails to which flocculent had been added and were then put into pre numbered cloth bags  there was no mention of spilling or overflow or pouring samples into bags 
samples were stored a safe distance away from drilling and sampling operations 
representative chip samples were collected  screened  and placed into chip trays 
echo bay constructed a sample preparation lab on the site that included a sample splitter  roll crusher  pulverizer  and drying oven 
for echo bay s core drilling program  core samples were collected at meter intervals and then sawed or split on site using a hydraulic splitter 
one half of the core was prepared for assay  and the other half was retained as a duplicate or for engineering purposes 
all echo bay samples were analyzed for gold using fire assay with an atomic adsorption finish fa aa 
if the fa aa analysis resulted in a grade higher than grams gold per tonne  a gravimetric finish was applied 
cone laboratories cone in denver  colorado performed the original assaying  with duplicate samples checked by rocky mountain geochemical rmg of salt lake city  utah 
no information is available on sample security for any of the historic drilling programs 
four assay data bases existed which mda audited and eventually merged into one data base 
the data base with the fewest errors less than for gold  silver  copper and arsenic values in an audit of of the gold values and of the other metal values was chosen as the base for merging 
following a review of the available documentation pertaining to the sampling and assaying programs  the data was deemed sufficiently accurate to use for estimation 
however  mr 
ristorcelli noted that some of the early program s quality assurance and quality control procedures were poorly documented and that an apparent bias may exist between some of the assay values and the check assay values of the same samples 
three other independent consulting firms have noted  and echo bay acknowledged  the apparent bias  but no one has been able to quantify it 
mda concluded that the potential impact to the project could be half in grade and half in tonnage 
as the original samples were not preserved and cannot be re assayed  mr 
ristorcelli recommended a to hole drill program to confirm the validity of the model that relied on those assays whose check assay bias is unresolved 
in late and early  we completed a hole core drill program for metallurgical testwork and to evaluate any apparent check assay bias  under the direction of our vice president of exploration  frank fenne  pg  who is a qualified person within the meaning of ni drilling was done by major drilling of hermosillo  sonora  mexico  and core logging and sampling was done by consultants of vista gold 
sample preparation was by als chemex of hermosillo  who sent prepared sample pulps to als chemex in vancouver  british columbia  canada for assaying 
check assaying was done by acme labs in vancouver 
sampling  sample custody  preparation and assaying were completed in compliance with ni standards 
however  the results of the drilling did not resolve the apparent check assay bias and additional work to resolve the issue is ongoing 
mr 
ristorcelli undertook multiple checks including review of the geologic interpretation  an assessment of the statistical behavior of the gold grades in the context of the geologic setting  classical statistics on the entire database and by rock type  and geostatistics by domain to assess the validity of the model 
he then classified the mineral resources into measured  indicated and inferred categories of ni requirements  following cim definition standards 
under sec industry guide guidelines  mineralized material excluding mineral reserves reported separately at a cut off grade of grams gold per tonne totals  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne 
under cim standards  excluding mineral reserves which are reported separately  and using a cutoff grade of grams gold per tonne  measured mineral resources are estimated at  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne  indicated mineral resources are estimated at  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne  for combined measured and indicated mineral resources of  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne 
inferred mineral resources are excluded from estimates of mineral reserves and are estimated at  tonnes grading grams gold per tonne

cautionary note to us investors proven and probable mineral reserves as described in this table are based on canadian definitions under ni these reserves are based on a feasibility study that uses the three year historical trailing price  however  the company does not currently have the necessary permits to the mine property 
see the section heading cautionary note to united states investors regarding estimates of measured  indicated and inferred resources and proven and probable reserves above 
as of january   the trailing three year average gold price was per ounce  which is slightly higher than the per ounce gold price used by mda for the mineral reserves reported in the table above 
the three year trailing gold price was  per ounce at the end of therefore  under sec industry guide requirements  the qualified person believes the mineral reserve estimate listed above is conservative 
however  should we not be able to obtain the required governmental permits to mine the property  then the project would not have mineral reserves under either ni or sec industry guide see the section heading item a

total capital costs including replacement  reclamation and salvage value over the life of the project and final mine closure are estimated to be per ounce of gold produced 
payback of capital is estimated at years from the start of production at the los cardones gold project 
the base case economic analysis used a gold price profile with a gold price of per ounce in the first three years of production  decreasing to per ounce for the remainder 
an alternative sensitivity analysis was completed at a constant gold price of per ounce 
the economic analyses were conducted on equity basis with no consideration of debt or leasing

long valley gold project  california we acquired the long valley gold project in january the property consists of contiguous  unpatented mining claims that cover an area of approximately  acres 
the surface rights covering the area of the claims are owned by the us government  and are subject to a surface grazing lease 
the project is subject to a nsr royalty 
the project is located a few miles to the east of the sierra nevada mountains  at an elevation of about  feet  in an area of gently rolling terrain in the inyo national forest  about miles east of the town of mammoth lakes  in mono county  california  and about miles north of the town of bishop  california 
both towns are connected by us highway  which passes a few miles west of the property 
access to the property from the highway is via a series of graded gravel roads 
the property is in an undisturbed condition 
the climate is semi arid and moderate  with high temperatures in the summer generally in the degree fahrenheit range and winter highs generally in the degree fahrenheit range 
winter temperatures can be below zero degrees fahrenheit 
precipitation at the property totals approximately to inches per year  divided between winter snows and summer thunderstorms 
snow depths in winter are generally less than two feet 
the vegetation consists mostly of sagebrush and related shrubs and grasses with local areas of open pine forest 
during the s  a total of holes were drilled  various metallurgical and engineering studies were completed and permitting documents were submitted in support of constructing a small operation 
during the early s  geologic mapping  geochemical sampling  and geophysical surveying of the area was completed and reverse circulation holes were drilled 
these holes were mostly in the south zone  but also resulted in the discovery of two new zones contiguous with the south zone  the hilton creek zone and the southeast zone 
during the mid s  exploration activities significantly increased as the owner  at that time drilled approximately holes mostly in the hilton creek and southeast zones and undertook extensive studies related to metallurgical investigations  preliminary engineering studies  including resource estimations  and initiated baseline type environmental studies of the biological  water  and archeological resources of the area 
the database contains drill holes  totaling  feet 
the majority of holes were drilled using reverse circulation methods 
gold was primarily analyzed by fire assay  with grade determinations by atomic absorption 
because of other priorities  we have no immediate plans for developing the long valley gold project  and it is considered an immaterial project to the company at this time a location map follows 
picture geology and mineralization the long valley gold project claims are contained entirely within the early pleistocene age long valley caldera  which has been dated at about  years old 
the caldera is an elongated east west oval depression measuring some miles by miles and is related to eruption of the bishop tuff  which is covered by younger rocks within the caldera 
the long valley gold mineralization is located near the center of the caldera and is underlain by lithologic units related to the caldera formation and its subsequent resurgence 
associated with resurgent doming is a sequence of interbedded volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks which were deposited in a lacustrine setting within the caldera 
these rocks consist of sediment siltstones through conglomerates and debris flow deposits  with local deposits of intercalated silica sinter and rhyolite flows and dikes 
all of these lithologies have been altered and or mineralized to variable degrees 
intruding the generally flat lying lake sediments are several rhyolite domes that have been dated from  to  years in age 
the north south trending hilton creek fault zone appears to define the eastern limit of the resurgent dome within the central part of the long valley caldera and extends outside the caldera to the south 
offset along this fault appears to be variable and suggests that fault activity along this zone may be episodic in nature 
gold and silver mineralization at long valley appears to fall under the general classification of an epithermal  low sulfidation type deposit 
several areas  termed the north  central  south  southeast and hilton creek zones  on the long valley property are mineralized with low grades of gold and silver 
the mineralized zones are generally north south trending  up to  feet in length with widths ranging from feet to  feet 
the tabular bodies are generally flat lying or have a shallow easterly dip 
mineralization is typically from to feet thick and  in the south and southeast zones  is exposed at or very near the surface 
the top of the hilton creek zone is covered by to feet of alluvium 
the majority of the mineralization discovered to date is located in the hilton creek zone 
gold and silver mineralization is quite continuous throughout the zones and is well defined above a cut off grade of gold ounces per ton 
within the continuous zones of low grade gold mineralization above gold ounces per ton are numerous zones of higher grade mineralization above gold ounces per ton  particularly in the hilton creek zone  which may relate to zones of enhanced structural preparation 
mineralized zones typically correlate with zones of more intense clay alteration or argillization and or silicification 
awak mas gold project  sulawesi  indonesia property description and location we acquired the awak mas gold deposit in sulawesi  indonesia  in april this project is subject to a contract of work cow with the indonesian government  which mandates a royalty in certain circumstances 
the cow requires the holder to be responsible for conducting all stages of operations from prospecting to the marketing of refined minerals  as a contractor for and on behalf of the indonesian government 
the holder bears all risks of exploration 
in addition  the holder is required to employ indonesian personnel to the maximum extent possible and undertake their training and to endeavor to use indonesian goods and services wherever possible 
the holder of a cow must negotiate with land and or plantation owners for use of the surface 
this will be done in the future as needed for access  mining  tailings storage  waste disposal and processing plants 
the awak mas gold project lies kilometers south of the equator and is characterized by a typical tropical maritime monsoonal climate  with hot wet summers and marginally milder and dryer winters 
the annual average rainfall is  millimeters  with the dryer period extending from july through october 
temperatures during the rainy season generally range between and degrees celsius 
mining operations are possible all year  but monsoonal rainfall events may prevent operations for short periods of time hours 
the project area is mountainous  with steep razorback ridges and slope gradients generally ranging from degrees to degrees 
the project is moderately to extremely rugged in the western portion  becoming more subdued in the east  with elevations ranging from near sea level to  meters above mean sea level 
primary rainforest predominates in the more rugged and inaccessible western portion of the project area  giving way to partially logged and cleared re growth in lower lying and more accessible portions 
sulawesi is located within a seismically active area and a number of seismic events associated with the palu and mantano faults  located within kilometers of the project  have been recorded 
the project is accessible by existing secondary paved and gravel public roads 
the access roads will require improvements in order to support the loads associated with the construction of the project 
at the present time  the project area is undeveloped with only a small office camp complex and several sheds used for drill sample storage and the drill access roads constructed during the exploration phase 
electrical power is supplied by diesel generator 
project power requirements may be supplied by diesel generated power or with commercial power from the city of palopa 
if the latter is chosen  approximately kilometers of new power line construction will be required 
the project is located at the headwaters of a significant river system 
the awak mas project is held by our indonesian subsidiary pt masmindo dwi area ptm

to date  several of the earn in conditions have not been met 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  we will retain of the shares of ptm until am holdings completes the earn in conditions described above 
am holdings manages ptm 
in june  we entered into additional option agreement with pan asia subsequently assigned to am holdings  which provides am holdings the opportunity to earn an additional interest in salu siwa after it has earned a interest for a total of interest in salu siwa or an interest in the awak mas gold project 
am holdings can acquire the additional interest by i making cash payments totaling  over a nine month period  ii making a cash payment of  within months or issuing shares with a value equal to  if pan asia completes an initial public offering in that time  and iii carrying out a  meter drilling program outside of the current project resource area 
to date  cash payments of  have been made  but other earn in conditions have not been met 
because of other priorities  we have no immediate plans for developing the awak mas gold project  and it is considered an immaterial project to the company at this time

word awak mas 
jpg geology and mineralization the awak mas property is situated on the southern side of the central sulawesi metamorphic belt within a kilometer long  north northeast trending fault bounded block of basement metamorphic rocks and younger sediments 
the western margin of this block is represented by an easterly dipping thrust  whereas the eastern margin is defined by a major basement structure 
imbricate faulting has complicated the internal morphology of the block 
the property is dominated by the late cretaceous latimojong formation  consisting of phyllites  slates  basic to intermediate volcanics  limestone and schist representing a platform and or fore arc trough flysch sequence 
the latimojong formation overlies basement metamorphic rocks dominated by phyllites and slates 
both sequences have been intruded by late stage plugs and stocks of diorite  monzonite and syenite 
to the east of the metamorphic block  basic intermediate intrusives  pyroclastics and volcanogenic sediments comprising the mesozoic lamasi ophiolite complex appear to have been obducted into a position effectively overlying the younger flyschoid sequence and basement metamorphics during continental accretion 
gold mineralization is distinctly mesothermal in character  atypical of the more ubiquitous low temperature or epithermal precious metal mineralization within many island arc environments in indonesia 
gold is associated with sulfur poor  sodic rich fluids introduced at a relatively late stage in the tectonic history 
albite pyrite silica carbonate alteration  which accompanies gold deposition  clearly overprints the ductile fabric associated with deformation and metamorphism in the older basement lithologies 
the majority of gold mineralization on the property  including the awak mas deposit  is predominantly hosted within the flysch sequence  which typically dips at between and degrees  generally towards the north 
the majority of gold mineralization is associated with abundant quartz veining and silica albite pyrite alteration  however  the association of gold and quartz is not ubiquitous  with some vein zones appearing to be locally barren of mineralization 
two main styles of mineralization are present 
the first represents broad shallow dipping zones of sheeted and stockwork quartz veining and associated alteration that conform to the shear fabric  especially within the dark  graphitic mudstones 
the other style consists of steeper dipping zones of quartz veining and breccias associated with high angle faults cutting both the flyschoid cover sequence and basement metamorphic rocks 
late stage  north northeast trending normal faults locally disrupt or offset mineralization 
a surface layer of consolidated scree and colluvium averaging three to four meters maximum meters in thickness veneers the deposit 
the base of weak oxidation within the mineralized sequence typically is within meters of surface

overview vista gold corp 
and its subsidiaries collectively  vista  the company  the corporation  we  our or us operate in the gold mining industry 
we are focused on the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects  which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions such as earn in right agreements or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other mining companies  or outright sales of assets for cash and or other consideration 
as such  we are considered an exploration stage enterprise 
our approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the gold mineralization 
in addition  we look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling and or technical studies resulting in changes to the operating assumptions underlying previous engineering work 
our holdings include the mt 
todd gold project in australia  the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project in mexico  the los cardones formerly concordia gold project in mexico  the long valley gold project in california  the awak mas gold project in indonesia  and mining claims in utah 
in addition  we own approximately of the shares of midas gold corp 
midas gold  a company exploring for gold and developing the golden meadows project in the yellow pine stibnite district in idaho 
midas gold is listed on the toronto stock exchange under the trading symbol max 
outlook our mt 
todd gold project in the northern territory  australia will be our principal focus in our plans for mt 
todd include completing a final reserve estimate  initiating the process to permit construction of the project including an environmental impact statement  completing a feasibility study  and  if the project is feasible  initiating the financing for construction of the project 
subject to successful completion of each of these  construction could begin in early  with construction completion and plant commissioning occurring in the latter part of we do not currently generate operating cash flows 
our principal source of financing in the past has been the issuance of our common stock 
market interest in the gold sector has diminished in recent years  due at least in part to the popularity of gold exchange traded funds and the rising costs for mine construction and operation 
consequently  raising sufficient amounts of capital on reasonable terms has become increasingly difficult 
these conditions could continue into  and could affect our ability to raise the necessary capital on reasonable terms  if at all 
results from operations summary for the year ended december   we continued to advance our mt 
todd gold project in northern territory  australia with a view towards potential development 
in our drilling programs resulted in significant expansion of the mineral resource  we started treating the water in the existing open pit as a preliminary step to ultimately dewatering the pit  subject to strict quality standards and discharge rates  and we progressed significantly in the completion of a pre feasibility study on the project 
we also completed a drilling program at our guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project in sinaloa  mexico and completed a new resource estimate for that project 
consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was  or per basic share 
for the same period in we reported net income of  or per basic share 
for the same period in we reported net loss of  or per basic share 
the principal components of these year over year changes are discussed below 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs exploration  property evaluation and holding costs were   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the higher costs period to period were primarily due to increased activity at our mt 
todd gold project associated with the pre feasibility and feasibility studies and related activities  drilling  permitting  and the september start of water treatment in the existing open pit 
at our los cardones gold project  costs decreased in from because since february invecture group  sa de sa invecture began to incur all costs associated with the progression of this project under an earn in right agreement earn in right agreement 
los cardones costs in approximated those of we completed a drilling program at our guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project in early and have incurred minimal costs for the remainder of as our efforts were then focused on the mt 
todd gold project 
corporate administration and investor relations corporate administration and investor relations costs were   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the higher costs were primarily due to legal and professional fees associated with activities such as our shelf registration statement and completion of the earn in right agreement  and an increase in stock based compensation expense incurred to attract additional professional staff and consultants and to incentivize and retain professional staff and directors 
similarly  the higher costs in compared to were primarily due to increases in compensation  principally stock based compensation  to incentivize and retain professional staff and directors 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  and for years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases period to period were primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures at the mt 
todd gold project 
gain loss on extinguishment of convertible debt during may  we repurchased a portion of our convertible debt  then outstanding 
we paid the debt holder  in cash and issued  common shares as consideration for the principal amount of the notes and interest payable of  in aggregate 
the common shares issued were based on a share price of per share 
a loss of  was recorded in our consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income loss as a result of the repurchase 
the company had no similar transactions during or gain on disposal of mineral property pursuant to a joint venture agreement with awak mas holdings pty 
ltd 
am holdings  whereby am holdings may earn an interest in our awak mas gold project in indonesia  we received certain cash payments in excess of the carrying value of the project  which resulted in a realized gain of  during the year ended december  in april  vista was issued  common shares in the capital of midas gold as consideration for its interest in gold assets in the yellow pine stibnite district in idaho 
upon initial recognition of its investment in the midas gold shares  vista elected to apply the fair value option  and as such  the investment was recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
the difference between the fair value of our midas gold shares and the carrying value of our yellow pine assets resulted in an unrealized gain of  the company had no similar transactions in non operating income and expenses unrealized gain loss on other investments unrealized gain loss on other investments was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts are substantially the result of changes in fair value of our midas gold shares 
the company had no similar transactions in deferred income tax benefit expense the deferred income tax benefit of  is principally related to the unrealized loss arising from the change in fair value of our midas gold shares 
the deferred tax expense of  is a result of the unrealized gains arising from the disposal of gold assets in the yellow pine stibnite district in idaho in exchange for shares of midas gold  and subsequent fair value gains in our midas gold shares see above 
the estimated deferred tax liability associated with the gains exceeded our us deferred tax asset valuation allowance  consequently this valuation allowance was released upon receipt of the midas gold shares 
there were no similar gains or losses in fluctuations in the fair value of our midas gold shares will result in fluctuations in the deferred income tax benefit expense 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase period to period was primarily the result of increases in exploration  property evaluation and holding costs and corporate administration and investor relations costs as discussed above 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  was primarily due to receipt of  from agreements related to awak mas and los cardones projects  offset by additions to plant and equipment of  mainly at our mt 
todd gold project 
net cash used in investing activities of  for the same period in was primarily due to the acquisition for cash of  additional midas gold shares issued in a private placement 
net cash used in investing activities of  for the same period in was primarily due to land acquisition costs at the los cardones gold project 
financing activities during july  we closed a private placement of  units the july units for gross proceeds of  the july offering 
each july unit consists of one common share in the capital of the company and one half of one common share purchase warrant each full warrant  a july warrant 
each july warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one common share at a price of per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances and is exercisable for a period of months from the closing of the july offering 
in connection with the july offering  we incurred in commissions and other costs and issued a total of  compensation warrants to finders that provided services in respect of subscriptions for  july units 
each compensation warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one common share at a price of per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances for a period of months from the closing of the july offering 
on september   we filed a registration statement on form s related to the resale by the purchasers of the july units of the common shares issued as part of the units and common shares issuable upon exercise of the july warrants and compensation warrants 
during december  we closed a public offering of  units the december units  which included  december units issued pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  for gross proceeds of  the december offering 
each december unit consists of one common share in the capital of the company and one half of one common share purchase warrant each full warrant  a december warrant 
each december warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one common share at a price of per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances and is exercisable for a period of months from the closing of the december offering 
in connection with the december offering  the company incurred approximately  in commissions and other costs 
the net proceeds from both financing transactions are being used principally for ongoing technical evaluations engineering studies  exploration resource conversion drilling and water treatment at the mt 
todd gold project and for general corporate purposes 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  we raised a net total of  from the july offering and the december offering 
in addition  we received a total of  from the exercise of warrants  compensation options and stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  on march  we repaid the outstanding principal amount of  on our senior secured convertible notes 
in april  we received net cash proceeds of  from an equity financing 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  we completed a private placement offering during october which resulted in net cash proceeds to us of  we repaid  of the outstanding convertible notes payable balance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of  compared with working capital of  at december   representing an increase of  working capital increased primarily because of the reclassification of our investment in midas gold from long term assets to current assets  as the restrictions on the sale of the midas gold shares will expire in july cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december  we plan to complete a feasibility study at our mt 
todd gold project by mid we will need to raise additional cash to maintain that schedule  to complete the permitting process for the construction of the mt 
todd gold project  and for general corporate purposes 
our source of financing is expected to be one or a combination of bridge loan  sale of all or a portion of our midas gold shares  a structured facility secured by our midas shares  or the issuance of our common stock 
there is no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
should the mt 
todd feasibility study demonstrate that the project is sufficiently robust to support an appropriate project debt facility  we will initiate raising sufficient capital to construct the mt 
todd mine 
in that regard  we plan to explore all available avenues for financing a large gold project  including project debt  export credit agency debt or guarantees  equipment leasing  royalty and streaming arrangements  high yield debt  the sale of all or a portion of our midas gold shares  a structured facility secured by our midas gold shares  or issuance of our common stock 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise this additional capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements required to be disclosed in this annual report on form k 
contractual obligations at december   our contractual obligations consist of our obligation for the balance due on our acquisition of land for our los cardones gold project  which is due upon the achievement of certain milestones and is recorded in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   vista gold has sufficient finances to meet its contractual obligations through december  summary of quarterly results th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter revenue net income loss basic income loss per share revenue net income loss basic income loss per share transactions with related parties agreement with sierra partners llc on april   we entered into an agreement with sierra partners llc sierra pursuant to which sierra provides us with support and analysis of our general corporate finance and strategy efforts

project updates mt 
todd gold project  australia the january mt 
todd preliminary feasibility study contemplated a  tpd project 
as explained above  the continued success from our resource conversion drilling program led management to consider increasing the size of the process facilities ranging from   tpd to balance the significant increase in resources with an economically attractive project 
recent analysis of the resource model has led management to conclude that a g au t cut off grade combined with a smaller  scalable plant has the potential to result in better project economics 
the larger throughput rate will require additional capital expenditures at the time the decision is made 
project development update october we announced that we have completed a comprehensive analysis focused on optimizing the development plans for the mt 
todd gold project in northern territory  australia 
after a thorough review  management has selected for evaluation a two phased strategy to achieve its development goals and economic objectives 
stage contemplates the construction of a  tpd project using a higher cut off grade g au tonne vs 
g au tonne used in all prior vista analysis  with lower grade material to be stockpiled 
stage would involve an expansion to  tpd after payback of initial capital and contemplates a reduction in the cut off grade to g au tonne and the processing of stockpiled material from stage this two phased strategy enables us to minimize initial capital costs and further increase the average grade of material to the mill in the early years of the project to achieve the shortest possible payback period 
it also provides the opportunity to achieve a increase in project scale with modest additional capital expenditures to allow us to take advantage of mt 
todd s large and growing resource base 
additionally  we intend to complete a preliminary feasibility study in the first quarter of that evaluates this development strategy 
we expect to complete a feasibility study for the project in the second quarter of  subject to the results of the preliminary feasibility study 
exploration activity the focus of the geology staff in has been on the development drilling and exploration on the exploration licenses has been limited to meeting commitments to maintain the licenses in good standing 
update drilling on snowdrop in late november  a single diamond drill hole was completed on the target before the onset of the wet season 
sd was drilled at an angle across the target zone to a depth of m 
although the hole did not intersect significant ore grade mineralization  assay results were encouraging  and we believe that additional drilling is warranted 
the hole intersected zones of intensely silicified greywackes and shales with minor sheeted quartz veins 
the alteration and veining is remarkably similar to that observed at the batman deposit in the vicinity of the core zone 
the greywacke units are coarser grained than at batman  but the frequency of lithological changes and alteration types are all very similar 
sulfides are present within the quartz veining and as disseminated blebs within intensely silicified siltstones 
common sulfide minerals include pyrite  pyrrhotite  chalcopyrite  and arsenopyrite with traces of galena  sphalerite and bornite 
veining has a steep dip to the east  similar to batman  but appears richer in base metals 
disseminated sulphides are also more abundant  while the vein density is not as intense as batman 
guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project  mexico preliminary economic assessment in march  we announced the completion of a preliminary economic assessment pea for the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project in sinaloa  mexico which evaluated the viability of a  tonne per day  tonne per annum processing facility with positive results 
the guadalupe de los reyes pea was completed by tetratech mm  inc of golden  colorado  pursuant to canadian national instrument standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 
the pea was completed by or under the supervision of edwin c 
lips pe  dr 
rex bryan  vicki scharnhorst pe and erik spiller  each independent qualified persons as defined in ni 
mr 
lips  dr 
bryan and mr 
spiller have reviewed and approved the technical and scientific information contained in this report 
previous technical reports contain extensive geologic and technical information related to the deposit  on which this estimate relies 
the last technical report was filed on sedar on november  and is entitled technical report resource of guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project sinaloa  mexico and was issued on november  the pea is intended to provide only an initial review of the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project potential and is preliminary in nature 
the pea includes inferred resources that are considered to be too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves  and there is no certainty that the economic results described in the pea will be realized 
project economics the following table provides details on the project s economics at variable gold price assumptions 
financials discount rate gold silver price assumptions units base case average gold cash cost us oz after tax npv us m irr after tax payback after tax years project concept the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project  as currently envisioned  consists of five small open pits within the guadalupe de los reyes system  all located within approximately km of each other 
conventional open pit methods are recommended for mining the five deposits 
the deposits are typical of a low sulfidation epithermal system with mineralization occurring in westward dipping structural zones that range from a few meters to tens of meters in thickness 
the gold occurs as microscopic sized  free to quartz encapsulated electrum associated with silver sulfides 
historic metallurgic testwork focused on heap leach recovery methods  however vista believes that finer grind size through milling could lead to better recoveries 
vista testwork has focused on gold extraction under a conventional mill and cil circuit and has resulted in an estimated average gold recovery of and a range of silver recoveries  dependent on the specific deposit tested 
mill throughput is assumed to be  tonnes per day or  tonnes per year 
with this assumed production rate  the mine life would be approximately years  with million tonnes of material processed 
the mine would have an overall strip ratio of tonnes of waste rock per tonne of economic mineralized rock 
gold accounts for approximately of the value of the payable metals with silver accounting for the balance 
mineral resources the mineral resources utilized in this pea were announced in november and are contained in a separate technical report that was filed on november  those mineral resources are summarized in the table below

the minimal amount of deep drilling conducted by the company together with historical records indicate that the stockwork of the low sulfidation epithermal vein system that is the host for the deposits evaluated in the pea consolidate into high grade vein systems with widths that could be mined by underground mining methods 
we believe there is a possibility that with time and the appropriate exploration expenditures  a high grade underground mineable resource could potentially be developed 
the guadalupe de los reyes project is without known mineral reserves under sec industry guide and the proposed program at guadalupe de los reyes is exploratory in nature 
for the remainder of  our expenditures on guadalupe de los reyes will be restricted to property holding costs and community support initiatives as the company is primarily focused on the continued evaluation of the mt

significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies use of estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relating to capital costs of projects  mine closure and reclamation obligations  useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  the fair value and accounting treatment of financial instruments including marketable securities and stock based compensation  and asset impairments including impairments long lived assets and investments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accordingly  actual results will differ from these amounts estimated in these financial statements 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and money market securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
because of the short maturity of these investments  the carrying amounts approximate their fair value 
restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other current assets 
marketable securities we classify marketable securities as available for sale 
accordingly  these securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being reported in other comprehensive income until such time that the securities are disposed of or become impaired 
at that time  any gains or losses will then be realized and reported in our consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income loss 
we use the specific identification method for determining carrying value in computing realized gains and losses on sales of investment securities 
we evaluate investments in a loss position to determine if such a loss is other than temporary 
if so  such loss will be recognized and reported during that period 
mineral properties mineral property acquisition costs  including directly related costs  are capitalized when incurred  and mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred 
when we determine that a mineral property can be economically developed in accordance with us gaap  the costs then incurred to develop such property will be capitalized 
capitalized costs will be depleted using the units of production method over the estimated life of the proven and probable reserves 
if mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired  any undepleted costs will be charged to loss in that period 
the recoverability of the carrying values of our mineral properties is dependent upon economic reserves being discovered or developed on the properties  permitting  financing  start up  and commercial production from  or the sale lease of  or other strategic transactions related to these properties 
development and or start up of any of these projects will depend on  among other things  management s ability to raise additional capital for these purposes 
although we have successfully raised capital in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
we assess the carrying cost of our mineral properties for impairment whenever information or circumstances indicate the potential for impairment 
this would include events and circumstances such as our inability to obtain all the necessary permits  changes in the legal status of our mineral properties  government actions  the results of exploration activities and technical evaluations and changes in economic conditions  including the price of gold and other commodities or input prices 
such evaluations compare estimated future net cash flows with our carrying costs and future obligations on an undiscounted basis 
if it is determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property  a write down to the estimated fair value will then be reported in our consolidated statement of income loss for the period 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not determinable and where other conditions indicate the potential for impairment  management uses its judgment to assess if the carrying value can be recovered and to estimate fair value 
plant and equipment plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging primarily from three to ten years 
significant expenditures that increase the life of an asset  including interest on expenditures on qualifying assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
upon sale or retirement of assets  the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gains or losses will be reported in our consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income loss 
assets held for sale plant and equipment is classified as held for sale when the following conditions are met i assets or group of assets are actively marketed for a price which reasonably approximates the fair value at the time of sale  ii management has committed to a plan to sell the assets or group of assets  iii the assets or group of assets are available for sale in current condition  and iv sale is probable within the next months 
asset retirement obligation and closure costs the fair value of a liability for our legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets is recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset unless the asset has been previously written off  in which case the amount is expensed 
the liability will be adjusted for changes in the expected amounts and timing of cash flows required to discharge the liability and accreted to the full value over time through periodic charges to our consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income loss 
warrants and compensation options warrants and compensation options issued are recorded at fair value using the black scholes merton fair value model adjusted to relative fair value 
stock based compensation under our stock option and long term equity incentive plans  common share options and awards may be granted to executives  employees  consultants and non employee directors 
compensation expense for such grants is recorded in the consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income loss as a component of exploration  property evaluation and holding costs and corporate administration and investor relations  with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair values of the options are calculated using the hull white trinomial lattice option pricing model 
the expense is based on the fair values of the grant on the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period specified for each grant 
financial instruments accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc of the financial accountig standards board fasb requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
asc establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent  objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value 
a financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
asc prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities

monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date 
non monetary items are translated at the historical rate unless such items are carried at market value  in which case they are translated using exchange rates that existed when the value were determined

income taxes we provide for income taxes using the liability method of tax allocation 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on deductible or taxable temporary differences between financial statement values and tax values of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled  based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
deferred tax is recognized as income or an expense and included in the profit or loss for the period  except when it arises from a transaction that is recognized directly in equity  in which case the deferred tax is also recognized directly in equity 
we establish a valuation allowance against the future income tax assets if  based on available information  it is more likely than not that all of the assets will not be realized 
uncertainty in income tax positions the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
the company records the related interest expense and penalties  if any  as tax expense in the tax provision 
net income loss per share basic income loss per share amounts are calculated by using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted income loss per share amounts reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts that may require the issuance of common shares in the future were converted unless their inclusion would be anti dilutive 
recent accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued guidance that requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement has been eliminated 
this guidance was effective for us in the first quarter of and should be applied prospectively 
our presentation of comprehensive income already complies with this new guidance 
reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued guidance related to items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 
the new standard requires either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements i the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its sources and ii the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
the standard is effective for us january   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are engaged in the acquisition of gold projects and related activities  including exploration  engineering  permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies 
the value of our properties  as well as our marketable securities and our investment in midas gold corp  is related to the price of gold  and changes in the price of gold could affect the value of  and or our ability to generate revenue from  our portfolio of gold projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for and supply of gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
the market value for gold cannot be predicted for any particular time 
because we have exploration operations in mexico  indonesia and australia  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations
