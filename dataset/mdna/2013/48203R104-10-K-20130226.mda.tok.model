item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k report  including the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of juniper networks  inc we  us  or the company that are based on our current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections about our business  our results of operations  the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  would  could  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements by their nature address matters that are  to different degrees  uncertain  and these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this report under the section entitled risk factors in item a of part i and elsewhere  and in other reports we file with the sec 
while forward looking statements are based on reasonable expectations of our management at the time that they are made  you should not rely on them 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
in the course of operating our business  we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices  the collection of receivables  the manufacturing and shipment of products  the fulfillment of orders  the purchase of supplies  and the building of inventory and spare parts  among other matters 
each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period 
in making these decisions  we consider various factors including contractual obligations  customer satisfaction  competition  internal and external financial targets and expectations  and financial planning objectives 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  pricing credits  warranty costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges  assumptions used in the valuation of share based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates  see note  significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report  and our critical accounting policies and estimates section included in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report  we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment 
these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item  our risk factors section included in item a of part i  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of part ii of this report 
business and market environment at juniper networks  we design  develop  and sell products and services that together provide our customers with a high performance network infrastructure built on simplicity  security  openness  and scale 
we serve the high performance networking requirements of global service providers  enterprises  governments  and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success 
our core competencies in hardware systems  silicon design  network architecture  and our open cross network software platform are helping customers achieve superior performance  greater choice and flexibility  while reducing overall total cost of ownership 
we do business in three geographic regions americas  emea  and apac 
beginning in the first quarter of  we aligned our organizational structure to focus on our platform and software strategy  which resulted in two business segments organized principally by product families psd and ssd 
our psd segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used in service provider  enterprise  and public sector networks to control and direct network traffic between data centers  core  edge  aggregation  campus  wans  branch  and consumer and business devices 
our ssd segment offers software solutions focused on network security and network services applications for both service providers and enterprise customers 
both segments offer worldwide services  including technical support and professional services  as well as educational and training programs to our customers 

table of contents we remain focused on a common vision for the new network and we believe that the organizational structure we have in place will effectively drive our innovative portfolio and support our customers next generation network requirements 
together  our high performance product and service offerings help our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation  value  increased performance  reliability  and security to end users 
we remain dedicated to uncovering new ideas and innovations that will serve the exponentially increasing demands of the networked world  and we will endeavor to continue to build solutions that center on simplification  automation  and open innovation 
during  we saw moderate growth in some of our primary markets 
we continued to experience an uncertain global macroeconomic environment in which our customers exercised care and conservatism in their investment prioritization and project deployments 
we expect that our customers will continue to remain cautious with their capital spending in the near term 
we also continued to experience declining product gross margins and pricing pressures from our competitors 
we believe our product gross margins may continue to decline in the future  offset by operational improvements and cost efficiencies 
nevertheless  we are focused on executing our strategy to address the market trends of mobile internet and cloud computing and we continue to see positive long term fundamentals for high performance networking 
we continue to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio  which resulted in new product offerings during  including a smaller version of our qfabric solutions  the latest qfx m qfabric system  t core routers  ptx series packet transport switches 
additionally  we experienced new customer wins contributing to the growth in the ex series  mx series  and srx series 
we launched the new acx series router with support for both ethernet access aggregation and mpls  which extends network intelligence closer to the subscriber and features an open  standards based management system with software development kit sdk enabled programmability to enable rapid third party innovation 
we also announced new products and features in our simply connected portfolio  including srx series services gateways and wla series wireless lan access points  which simplify and secure mobile device access to enterprise networks 
furthermore  we acquired mykonos web security software  in february to complement our network security applications portfolio 
additionally  we announced innovative products to enable service providers to rapidly deliver and expand new consumer and business services 
these products include our mx and mx d universal edge routers and new junosv app engine  which enable service providers to transform the network edge into a platform for rapid service deployment 
we also launched the junos content encore with mx application services modular line card  which enables the delivery of premium content services over broadband connections across multiple device types 
furthermore  we announced a technology partnership with riverbed technology  inc riverbed that provides us with new capabilities for application delivery control  in exchange for juniper providing wan acceleration technology to riverbed  along with promoting riverbed as its wan optimization provider of choice going forward 
throughout  we focused on improved operational execution  continued innovation  and prudent capital allocation 
we continue to believe that the underlying trends driving network investment around the cloud and mobility are intact and remain strong 
during  we also initiated a variety of actions to ensure we are positioned for the future  resulting in a restructuring plan the restructuring plan to bring our cost structure more in line with our desired long term financial and strategic model 
the restructuring plan consists of workforce reductions  facility consolidations or closures  and supply chain and procurement efficiencies 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded costs of million for workforce reductions  facility consolidations or closures  and other charges during we also recorded certain inventory charges  intangible asset impairment charges  and contract termination costs of million 
we expect to incur charges related to the restructuring plan through the end of fiscal we continue to anticipate that our restructuring and cost reduction activities will result in approximately million in cost reduction savings  primarily in operating expenses  and to a lesser extent  in both product and service cost of revenues for the full year  in comparison to our full year levels 
see note  restructuring and other charges  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report  for further discussion of our restructuring activities 
on january   we communicated the following five principles that provide insight on our operating plans for we expect the macroeconomic environment to remain uncertain  we expect overall modest growth in the markets we serve  we expect to take share in routing and switching and stabilize our share in enterprise security  we expect to expand operating margins over  and we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows and prudently allocate capital 
these five principles are based on our management plans  assumptions  and expectations as of the date of this report 
although we believe we have been prudent in our plans  expectations  and assumptions  should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially 

table of contents financial results and key performance metrics overview the following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended december    and in millions  except per share amounts  percentages  day sales outstanding  and book to bill as of and for the years ended december  vs

change change change change net revenues gross margin percentage of net revenues operating income percentage of net revenues net income attributable to juniper networks percentage of net revenues net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stockholders basic diluted operating cash flows deferred revenue day sales outstanding dso book to bill dso and book to bill are for the fourth quarter ended   and net revenues our net revenue decreased in our emea and apac regions  offset by an increase in the americas region in  compared to by market  we experienced declines in both service provider and enterprise markets in  compared to the year over year decrease in our net revenues during was primarily due to a decline in sales of our core and edge legacy routing products and firewall products  partially offset by increases in our service revenue  switching products  and high end srx products 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in  compared to  due to lower product margin from million in inventory charges related to component inventory held in excess of forecasted demand and an intangible asset impairment charge of million  and to a lesser extent  due to an increase in the size and number of strategic contracts with lower margins  and a shift in product mix to lower margin products 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in service margin 
operating income our operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased in  compared to  primarily due to slower revenue growth relative to our sales and marketing and research and development expense  as we continue to invest in our innovative portfolio and bring new products to market 
in addition  restructuring and other associated charges of million were recorded in  related to workforce reduction activities  facility closures  asset impairment charges  and contract terminations 
net income attributable to juniper networks and net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stockholders the decrease in net income attributable to juniper networks in  compared to  reflects the lower operating income discussed above 
operating cash flows operating cash flows decreased in  compared to  primarily due to lower net income  higher taxes paid  timing of payments to our vendors  and a decrease in deferred revenue  offset by collections of our outstanding receivables 

table of contents deferred revenue total deferred revenue decreased million to million as of december   compared to million as of december   due to a decline in deferred service revenue  partially offset by an increase in deferred product revenue 
dso dso is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable  net of allowances  divided by average daily net sales for the preceding days 
dso for the quarter ended december  decreased by days  or compared to the quarter ended december  the decrease was primarily due to shipment linearity  resulting in a greater proportion of the periods shipments converted to cash by the end of the period and an increase in collections on our outstanding receivables 
book to bill book to bill represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period 
book to bill was greater than one for the quarter ended december  and one for the quarter ended december  stock repurchase plan activity under our stock repurchase program  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million during the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience  and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
note  significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 
inventory valuation and contract manufacturer liabilities 
inventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and is stated at lower of average cost or market 
a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete  to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 
in determining the provision  we also consider estimated recovery rates based on the nature of the inventory 
as of december  and  our inventory balances were million and million  respectively 
we establish a liability for non cancelable  non returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for carrying charges  quantities in excess of our demand forecasts  or obsolete material charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers to meet our demand forecasts or customer orders 
we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability 
as of december  and  our contract manufacturer liabilities were million and million  respectively 
significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand  recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory  and obsolete material exposures 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast  which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements  we may be required to increase our inventory write downs and contract manufacturer liabilities  which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities 
inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
we make significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions  and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer 
table of contents and product base  and the expected use of the acquired assets 
these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 
the value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as  but not limited to a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  b a substantial decline in our market capitalization  c an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  d unanticipated competition  e loss of key personnel  f a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  g a realignment of our resources or restructuring of our existing businesses in response to changes to industry and market conditions  h testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or i higher discount rate used in the impairment analysis as impacted by an increase in interest rates 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of november st or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segment level  by comparing the reporting unit carrying value  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches 
under the income approach  we estimate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of forecasted future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
under the market approach  we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting units to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
when the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  operating trends  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocated shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
as of december   goodwill recorded for our psd segment and ssd segment was  million and  million  respectively 
the fair value of our reporting units  in particular ssd  are sensitive to events or changes in circumstances  such as adverse changes in operating results or macro economic conditions  changes in management business strategy  or declines in our stock price 
a hypothetical decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would result in the fair value of our ssd segment to be above its carrying value by approximately and the fair value of our psd segment to be in excess of its carrying value by approximately 
see item a of part i  risk factors  for more information 
we evaluate long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if a long lived asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
warranty reserves 
we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
we use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  labor costs for trouble shooting and repair  and overhead at the time revenue is recognized 
material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period 
technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  if actual product failure rates  use of materials  or service delivery costs differ from estimates  additional warranty costs may be incurred  which could reduce gross margin 
as of december  and  our warranty reserves were million and million  respectively 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
under our revenue recognition policies  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives  pricing practices and controls  customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles 
when determining esp  we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles 
we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one to three years 
we applied esp to the majority of our product revenue and vsoe to our service revenue in   and share based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards including stock options  rsus  rsas  psas  and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp based on each award fair value on the grant date 
we utilize the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options and espp 
the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected award life  and risk free interest rate 
the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock  adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
the expected life of an award is based on historical experience 
we determine the fair value of rsus  rsas and psas based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
in addition  we use significant judgment in estimating share based compensation expense for our psas based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management best estimates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
if factors change and different assumptions are used  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
additionally  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience  as well as judgment  and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our recorded share based compensation expense could be different 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different that the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  by expiration of or lapses in the r d tax credit laws  by transfer pricing adjustments  including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r d cost sharing arrangement and legal structure  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  by tax costs related to intercompany realignments  by changes in accounting principles  or by changes in tax laws and regulations  including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income  or the foreign tax credit rules 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions  including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
loss contingencies 
we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customer industrial classification code  but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product 
the service provider market generally includes wireline  wireless  and cable operators  as well as major internet content and application providers  including those that provide social networking and search engine services 
the enterprise market generally comprises businesses  federal  state  and local governments  and research and education institutions 
net revenues from sales to the service provider market decreased in  compared to  primarily due to reduced routing purchases by some of our international and content service providers  partially offset by strong growth from tier carrier service providers in the americas 
net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in  compared to  across all of our geographic regions  specifically in the americas and emea 
the increase was largely attributable to customers adoption of our routing and switching products 
net revenues generated from the enterprise market decreased in  compared to  primarily due to lower revenue in federal and financial services  offset by our expanding presence in apac and emea 
net revenues generated from the enterprise market increased in compared to across all three geographic regions

net revenues in the americas increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased sales in the united states attributable to the demand for our routing and switching products and services from enterprise and service provider customers 
net revenues in emea decreased in  compared to  primarily due to decreased sales in western and southern europe as a result of the challenging economic climate in those areas 
the decrease was partially offset by increased revenues in the middle east and from a top service provider in eastern europe  across a broad range of our product portfolio 
the increase in net revenues in emea in  compared to  was driven by service provider and enterprise demand for our routing and switching products and related services  in both the service provider and enterprise markets 
the increases were largely attributable to sweden  eastern europe  and the netherlands 
in addition  we recognized the first revenue from a top service provider in eastern europe  across a broad range of our product portfolio 
net revenues in apac decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in sales to a certain service provider customer in japan  following a large product deployment that occurred in this decrease was partially offset by growth in china in the enterprise market 
net revenues in apac increased in  compared to  due to the increase in revenues from both service provider and enterprise markets

to a lesser extent  the decrease was due to an increase in the size and number of strategic contracts with lower margins and to a shift in product mix to lower margin products 
product gross margin percentage decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a lower proportion of router revenue  a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from the americas  and increased fixed overhead and inventory related costs 
from through  our product gross margins have declined 
we expect this trend to continue into  due to a shift in product mix and pricing pressures offset in part by innovation and cost efficiencies 
service gross margin percentage increased in  compared to  primarily due to higher service revenues  combined with a continuing focus on operational improvements and cost efficiencies 
service gross margin percentage decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a growth in headcount for service and support resources for our expanded product portfolio

off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
however  in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance  guarantees related to third party customer financing arrangements  customs and duties guarantees  and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities

rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we occupy approximately million square feet worldwide under operating leases 
the majority of our office space is in north america  including our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
our longest lease expires on november  purchase commitments in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply  our contract manufacturers place non cancelable  non returnable ncnr orders for components based on our build forecasts 
the contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers 
generally  we do not own the components and title to the product transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location 
if the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time  we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 
as of december   we had accrued million based on our estimate of such charges 
total purchase commitments as of december   consisted of million of ncnr orders 
long term debt and interest payment on long term debt in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes  and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes and  together with the notes and the notes the notes 
interest on the notes is payable in cash semiannually 
we may redeem the notes  at any time in whole or from time to time in part  subject to a make whole premium  and  in the event of a change in control  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of the notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principle amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
the indenture that governs the notes also contains various covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur liens or enter into sale leaseback transactions over certain dollar thresholds 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
based on our current outlook  we expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants over the next twelve months 
other contractual obligations other contractual obligations primarily consisted of million in indemnity related and service related escrows  required by certain acquisitions completed in    and and million in campus build out obligations 

table of contents tax liabilities in addition to the table above  tax liabilities include million of long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
guarantees we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance  guarantees related to third party customer financing arrangements  customs and duties guarantees  and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities

liquidity and capital resource requirements liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future 
additionally  if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program  our liquidity may be impacted 
as of december   of our cash and investment balances are held outside of the us  which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 
in august  we filed a billion shelf registration with the sec 
in march  we issued notes in the amount of billion under the shelf registration statement 
therefore  while we have no current plans to do so  we may issue up to million in additional securities under the shelf registration statement 
the shelf registration is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions 
any additional offerings of securities under the shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus 
we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant 
our intention for fiscal year was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis where each option  rsu  rsa or psa granted is counted as one share  with psas counted at their target amount 
based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options  rsus  and psas  we achieved the goal for in fiscal year  as a result of stock price weakness we increased our repurchase activity  and expect to continue to calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time 
we have also managed our equity compensation programs to reduce the overall number of shares subject to outstanding awards over the past two years 
notably  we have reduced the use of stock options in our equity compensation programs 
the total number of common shares subject to our outstanding awards in connection with juniper plans was million  million  and million shares as of december    and  respectively  reflecting a consecutive decline for the three years ended december  based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term  and long term investments which includes the proceeds of the issuance of the notes  together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months 
we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period 
however  our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors  including level and mix of our product  sales  and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditures and r d plans  repurchases of our common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility 
in addition  as of december   of our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities are held outside of the us our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these investments are also reviewed to identify and evaluate indications of potential other than temporary impairments as discussed in note  cash equivalents and investments  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december    and  related to the sales of our investments

market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts periodically  we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less 
our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars 
our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
approximately of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by non us dollar denominated operating expense and costs 
in designing a specific hedging approach  we consider several factors  including offsetting exposures  significance of exposures  costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument  and potential effectiveness of the hedge 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year 
the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates 
we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial during the years ended december    and  respectively  in other expense income  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
the change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue  r d  sales and marketing  and g a expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately   and in   and  respectively

equity price risk our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities and our non qualified deferred compensation nqdc plan  which may also hold publicly traded equity securities  are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 
our publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not purchase our publicly traded equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes
