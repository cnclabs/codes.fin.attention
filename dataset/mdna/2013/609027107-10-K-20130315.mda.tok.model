item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations monarch casino resort  inc  through its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  golden road motor inn  inc golden road  monarch growth inc monarch growth  monarch black hawk  inc 
monarch black hawk  high desert sunshine  inc high desert and golden north  inc golden north  owns and operates the atlantis casino resort spa  a hotel casino facility in reno  nevada the atlantis  the riviera black hawk casino in black hawk  colorado riviera black hawk  and real estate proximate to the atlantis and riviera black hawk 
monarch s wholly owned subsidiary monarch interactive  inc monarch interactive received approval from the nevada gaming commission on august   which approval was extended on february  for six months pending commencement of operations  for a license as an operator of interactive gaming 
before the license can be issued  a number of conditions must be met  within six months of the february  approval  and before operations can commence  the company must enter into contracts with a licensed interactive gaming service provider with an approved system 
none of these conditions have occurred  and monarch interactive is not currently engaged in any operating activities 
in nevada  legal interactive gaming is currently limited to intrastate poker 
our operating assets are the atlantis and the riviera black hawk 
our business strategy is to maximize revenues  operating income and cash flow primarily through our casino  food and beverage operations and at the atlantis  our hotel operations 
the riviera black hawk does not yet have a hotel 
we focus on delivering exceptional service and value to our guests 
our hands on management style focuses on customer service and cost efficiencies 
unless otherwise indicated  monarch  company  we  our and us refer to monarch casino resort  inc and its subsidiaries 
operating results summary our operating results may be affected by  among other things  competitive factors  gaming tax increases  the commencement of new gaming operations  construction at our facilities  general public sentiment regarding travel  overall economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the disposable income of our patrons and weather conditions affecting our properties 
in particular  our results for the year ended december  were impacted by non recurring expenses in connection with the acquisition of riviera black hawk  inc consequently  our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of future periods results 
the following significant factors and trends should be considered in analyzing our operating performance atlantis as in many other areas around the country  the impacts of the economic decline and weakness in northern nevada that began in the fourth quarter of continued to be felt in aggressive marketing programs by our competitors also posed challenges to us during that time 
furthermore  based on statistics released by the nevada gaming control board  the reno gaming revenue market has shrunk in the aggregate 
we anticipate that the ongoing macroeconomic weakness nationally and in the reno market  combined with aggressive marketing programs of our competitors  will continue to apply downward pressure on atlantis revenue 
riviera black hawk on april   we acquired riviera black hawk  inc  the owner of the riviera black hawk in black hawk  colorado which is located approximately miles from denver  colorado 
our initial focus with the riviera black hawk is to maximize casino and food and beverage revenues 
there is currently no hotel on the property 
we have evaluated all aspects of operations and have begun to implement certain operational changes which we believe will enhance the guest experience and reduce costs 
we have also begun to develop a master plan of future improvements to the riviera black hawk  which we expect to include  among other things  a property wide renovation  including renovations of all casino  restaurant  public areas  and  subject to our final evaluation  construction of a new multi story parking facility  a hotel and related property amenities 
results of operations comparison of operating results for the twelve months ended december  and atlantis operations for the year ended december   net revenue increased slightly to million from million for the same period of  approximately thousand or due to higher casino  food and beverage and other revenues partially offset by lower hotel revenues and higher promotional allowances due to an increase in the amount of complimentary food  beverage and other services provided to casino patrons complimentaries 
the increase in casino revenues was primarily due to higher slot revenues 
casino operating expenses as a percentage of casino revenue increased slightly to as compared to in the prior year primarily due to higher complimentaries partially offset by higher casino net revenue 
food and beverage revenues increased during the year driven by a decrease in covers served combined with a increase in the average revenue per cover 
this increase in the average revenue per cover was the result of menu price increases in response to higher food commodity costs 
these menu price increases contributed to an improvement in the food and beverage operating expenses as a percentage of food and beverage revenue from in prior year to for the current year 
hotel revenue decreased due to lower average daily room rate adr of in compared to in and lower hotel occupancy of during compared to during revenue per available room revpar  calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms available was and for the years ended december  and  respectively

riviera black hawk operations we acquired the riviera black hawk on april   and therefore  no information is given for the year ended december  the amounts of net revenue and operating income of riviera black hawk included in the company s consolidated statement of income  after elimination of intercompany transactions  for the year ended december  are as follows in thousands net revenues income from operations net income corporate and other expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense related to the addition of riviera black hawk 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense for increased by million over the prior year  million of which represents sg a expense from the black hawk operation for which the prior year reflects no expense

the higher use tax expense is primarily the result of a ruling from the nevada department of taxation that complimentary meals are subject to use tax effective february following nevada casino industry practice  the company did not recognize use tax on complimentary meals in the prior year 
during and  we incurred million and thousand  respectively  of non recurring acquisition expense directly related to the acquisition of riviera black hawk 
because of borrowings required to complete the riviera black hawk acquisition  the balance outstanding under our new credit facility increased from million at december  to million at december  as a result  interest expense increased to million in from thousand in see the credit facility below

capital spending and development we seek to continuously upgrade and maintain our facilities in order to present a fresh  high quality product to our guests 
capital expenditures during the years ended december  and were as follows twelve months ended december  capital expenditures atlantis black hawk a a we acquired riviera black hawk on april  during the twelve months ended december  and  capital expenditures at both the atlantis and riviera black hawk consisted primarily of the acquisition of gaming equipment to upgrade and replace existing equipment and other general upgrades to their respective facilities 
in addition to the above listed capital expenditures for atlantis and riviera black hawk  during  we acquired a acre land parcel in black hawk  colorado for million and paid a million deposit related to the acquisition of the riviera black hawk 
the land parcel is contiguous to the riviera black hawk 
future cash needed to finance ongoing capital expenditures and the redesign and upgrade of the black hawk property  is expected to be available from operating cash flow  the new credit facility see the credit facility below and  if necessary  additional borrowings 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our policies  including the estimated useful lives assigned to our assets  the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  self insurance reserves  the calculation of income tax liabilities and the calculation of share based compensation  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
to provide an understanding of the methodologies applied  our significant accounting policies are discussed where appropriate in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of monarch and its subsidiaries 
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company extends short term credit to its gaming customers 
such credit is non interest bearing and is due on demand 
in addition  the company also has receivables due from hotel guests which are primarily secured with a credit card at the time a customer checks in 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is set up for all company receivables based upon the company s historical collection and write off experience  unless situations warrant a specific identification of a necessary reserve related to certain receivables 
the company charges off its uncollectible receivables once all efforts have been made to collect such receivables 
the book value of receivables approximates fair value due to the short term nature of the receivables 
self insurance reserves we are currently self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for atlantis workers compensation and certain medical benefit costs provided to all of our employees 
as required by the state of colorado  we are fully insured for black hawk workers compensation costs 
the company reviews self insurance reserves at least quarterly 
the reserve is determined by reviewing the actual expenditures for the previous twelve month period and reports prepared by the third party plan administrator for any significant unpaid claims 
the reserve is an amount estimated to pay both reported and unreported claims as of the balance sheet date 
we believe changes in medical costs  trends in claims of our employee base  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for this reserve 
unforeseen developments in existing claims  or the possibility that our estimate of unreported claims differs materially from the actual amount of unreported claims  could result in the over or under estimation of our self insurance reserve 
capitalized interest the company capitalizes interest costs associated with debt incurred in connection with major construction projects 
when no debt is specifically identified as being incurred in connection with a construction project  the company capitalizes interest on amounts expended on the project at the company s average borrowing cost 
interest capitalization is ceased when the project is substantially complete 
the company did not capitalize interest during the years ended december   and casino revenues casino revenues represent the net win from gaming activity  which is the difference between wins and losses 
additionally  net win is reduced by a provision for anticipated payouts on slot participation fees  progressive jackpots and any pre arranged marker discounts 
progressive jackpot provisions are recognized in two components as wagers are made for the share of player s wagers that are contributed to the progressive jackpot award and as jackpots are won for the portion of the progressive jackpot award contributed the company 
promotional allowances our frequent player program allows members  through the frequency of their play at the casino  to earn and accumulate points which may be redeemed for a variety of goods and services complimentaries 
points may be applied toward hotel room stays  food and beverage consumption at the food outlets  gift shop items as well as goods and services at the spa and beauty salon and for cash in our black hawk property 
points earned may also be applied toward off property events such as concerts  shows and sporting events 
we recognize complimentaries expense at the time points are earned  which occurs commensurate with casino patron play 
the amount of expense recognized is based on the estimated cost of the complimentaries expected to be redeemed 
the retail value of hotel  food and beverage services provided to customers without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances 
the cost of the products and services earned is reported as casino operating expense 
income taxes income taxes are recorded in accordance with the liability method pursuant to authoritative guidance 
under the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes  the following basic principles are applied in accounting for income taxes at the date of the financial statements a a current liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on taxes for the current year  b a deferred income tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  c the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on the provisions of the enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated  and d the measurement of deferred income taxes is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based upon available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities 
we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes 
under the accounting guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included in current and noncurrent tax liabilities  based on when expected to be recognized  within the consolidated balance sheets at december  and stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
it requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period 
we calculate the grant date fair value using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions which include the expected term of options granted  risk free interest rates  expected volatility  and expected rates of dividends 
we estimate an expected term for each stock option grant based on the weighted average time between grant date and exercise date and the risk free interest rate assumption was based on us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term 
we use historical data and projections to estimate expected volatility and expected employee behaviors related to option exercises and forfeitures 
changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the estimate of the stock options fair value 
in our judgment  the most volatile input for our company has been the expected volatility assumption which has fluctuated significantly from to and then again to for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair value of the company s financial instruments has been determined by the company  using available market information and valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value  thus  the estimates provided herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the carrying amounts of cash  receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic 
the company tests its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year  or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level  and each of the company s casino properties is considered to be a reporting unit 
the company s annual goodwill impairment testing utilizes a two step process 
in the first step  the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  then the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to be impaired  and impairment is measured in the second step of the process 
in the second step  the company estimates the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment that may allow them to skip the annual two step test as appropriate 
goodwill consists of the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations 
as of december   we recorded goodwill totaling million related to the purchase of riviera black hawk  inc business combinations the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions  including fair value estimates  as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period defined as the period  not to exceed one year  in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination in a manner that is generally similar to the previous purchase method of accounting 
under the acquisition method of accounting  we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree  generally at the acquisition date fair value 
we measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred  which we also measure at fair value  over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking  legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to acquisition expense as they are incurred 
should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period  we report provisional amounts in our financial statements 
during the measurement period  we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements 
we apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements  including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense 
under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations  if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date  those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill 
we record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense 
finite lived intangible assets our finite lived intangible assets include assets related to its customer relationships and trade name for the riviera black hawk  which are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we periodically evaluate the remaining useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
the customer relationship intangible asset represents the value associated with riviera black hawk rated casino guests 
the initial fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated based on the projected net cash flows associated with these casino guests 
the recoverability of our customer relationship intangible asset could be affected by  among other things  increased competition within the gaming industry  a downturn in the economy  declines in customer spending which would impact the expected future cash flows associated with the rated casino guests  declines in the number of visitations which could impact the expected attrition rate of the rated casino guests  and erosion of operating margins associated with rated casino guests 
should events or changes in circumstances cause the carrying value of the customer relationship intangible asset to exceed its estimated fair value  an impairment charge in the amount of the excess would be recognized 
fair value measurement asc establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for various valuation techniques eg market value  income approach and cost approach 
the levels of the hierarchy are described below level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and level unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions 
the fair value measurements relating to the acquired assets of riviera black hawk was determined using inputs within level and level of asc s hierarchy 
segment reporting we have defined two reportable segments  based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results 
we define the chief operating decision maker as our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and our chief financial officer 
our chief operating decision maker organizes and manages our business primarily on the basis of adjusted ebitda 
we include expenses such as corporate selling  general and administrative expense  which is not allocated to specific segments  in corporate and other expense 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  an increase of approximately million  or  compared to the same period last year 
this increase was primarily related to higher net income  higher depreciation and amortization  higher deferred income taxes  higher receivables  higher inventories and higher accrued expenses all partially offset by higher amortization of deferred loan costs  lower loss on disposal of assets  lower accounts payable and lower income taxes payable in compared to net cash used in investing activities totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities during consisted primarily of net cash paid to acquire riviera black hawk and cash spent to acquire property and equipment 
during  net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of million for the acquisition of a land parcel in black hawk  colorado contiguous to the riviera black hawk  a million acquisition deposit related to the acquisition agreement for riviera black hawk  inc  and capital expenditures for various general facility improvements and for purchase of additional gaming equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during primarily related to borrowings made to complete the acquisition of riviera black hawk compared to net cash used in financing activities of million during primarily represents net payments of our new credit facility see the credit facility below and loan issuance costs related to refinancing the previous credit facility 
we believe that our existing cash balances  cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the new credit facility will provide us with sufficient resources to fund our operations  meet our debt obligations  and fulfill our capital expenditure plans  however  our operations are subject to financial  economic  competitive  regulatory  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow  we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or eliminating planned capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital 
see item a 
risk factors 
commitments and contingencies our contractual cash obligations as of december  and the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period d less than to to more than total year years years years contractual cash obligations operating leases a current maturities of borrowings under new credit facility b purchase obligations c total contractual cash obligations a operating leases include  per year in lease and common area expense payments to the shopping center adjacent to the atlantis and  due in less than one year related to an office equipment lease at riviera black hawk 
b the amount represents outstanding draws against our new credit facility see liquidity and capital resources above as of december  c purchase obligations represent approximately million of commitments related to capital projects and approximately million of materials and supplies used in the normal operation of our business 
of the total purchase order and construction commitments  approximately million are cancelable by us upon providing a day notice 
d because interest payments under our new credit facility are subject to factors that in our judgment vary materially  the amount of future interest payments is not presently determinable 
these factors include future short term interest rates  our future leverage ratio which varies with adjusted ebitda and our borrowing levels and the speed with which we deploy capital and other spending which in turn impacts the level of future borrowings 
the interest rate under our new credit facility is libor  or a base rate as defined in the new credit facility  plus an interest rate margin ranging from to depending on our leverage ratio and whether libor or a base rate is utilized 
the interest rate is adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio which is calculated using operating results over the previous four quarters and borrowings at the end of the most recent quarter 
at december  our leverage ratio was such that pricing for borrowings was libor plus 
the credit facility on november   we amended and restated our million credit facility with a new facility the new credit facility 
the new credit facility was utilized by us to finance the acquisition of riviera black hawk  inc and may be used for working capital needs  general corporate purposes and for ongoing capital expenditure requirements 
the maximum available borrowings under the new credit facility are million 
the maturity date of the new credit facility is november  borrowings are secured by liens on substantially all of our real and personal property 
the new credit facility contains customary covenants for a facility of this nature  including  but not limited to  covenants requiring the preservation and maintenance of our assets and covenants restricting our ability to merge  transfer ownership of monarch  incur additional indebtedness  encumber assets and make certain investments 
the new credit facility contains covenants requiring that we maintain certain financial ratios and achieves a minimum level of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and other non cash charges adjusted ebitda on a trailing four quarter basis 
it also contains provisions that restrict cash transfers between monarch and its affiliates and contains provisions requiring the achievement of certain financial ratios before the company can repurchase common stock or pay dividends 
management does not consider the covenants to restrict normal functioning of day to day operations 
as of december   we were required to maintain a leverage ratio  defined as consolidated debt divided by adjusted ebitda  of no more than and a fixed charge coverage ratio adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges  as defined of at least as of december   the company s leverage ratio was  and the fixed charge coverage ratio was the maximum principal available under the new credit facility is reduced by per quarter beginning in the second quarter of we may permanently reduce the maximum principal available at any time so long as the amount of such reduction is at least thousand and a multiple of thousand 
maturities of our borrowings for each of the three years and thereafter as of december  are as follows amounts in thousands year maturities thereafter we may prepay borrowings under the new credit facility without penalty subject to certain charges applicable to the prepayment of libor borrowings prior to the end of the applicable interest period 
amounts prepaid may be reborrowed so long as the total borrowings outstanding do not exceed the maximum principal available 
we paid various one time fees and other loan costs which totaled million upon the closing of the new credit facility that are being amortized over the term of the new credit facility using the straight line method which approximates the effective interest method 
at december   we had million outstanding under the new credit facility 
at that time our leverage ratio was such that pricing for borrowings under the new facility was libor plus 
at december  the one month libor interest rate was 
the carrying value of the debt outstanding under the new facility approximates fair value because the interest fluctuates with the lender s prime rate or other market rates of interest 
we believe that our existing cash balances  cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the new credit facility will provide us with sufficient resources to fund our operations  meet our debt obligations  and fulfill our capital expenditure plans over the next twelve months  however  our operations are subject to financial  economic  competitive  regulatory  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow  we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or eliminating planned capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital

risk factors 
recently issued accounting standards in april  the fasb issued guidance on accruing for jackpot liabilities that clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities or portions thereof before a jackpot is won if the entity can legally avoid paying that jackpot for example  by removing the gaming machine from the casino floor 
jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot 
this guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots 
the guidance was effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  and was applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption 
under nevada gaming regulations  the removal of base jackpots is not prohibited and upon adoption  the company reversed previously accrued base jackpots of thousand as of january  as a credit to opening retained earnings 
this adoption did not affect the accounting for progressive jackpots  as the company s existing accounting was in accordance with the new guidance 
in december  the fasb issued amendments to enhance disclosures about offsetting and related arrangements 
this information will enable the users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity s financial position  including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial and derivative instruments 
these amendments are effective for annual reporting periods  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after january  the disclosures required by these amendments should be provided retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
management does not believe that these amendments will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu 
under the amendments in asu  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the two step impairment test 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu no 
amends the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by allowing companies to first assess the qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset might be impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
the changes to the asc as a result of this update are effective prospectively for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  january  for the company 
the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
a variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under review and study by standard setting organizations and certain regulatory agencies 
because of the tentative and preliminary nature of such proposed standards  we have not yet determined the effect  if any  that the implementation of any such proposed or revised standards would have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market risks and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not have any cash or cash equivalents as of december  subject to market risk 
as of december  we had million of outstanding debt under our new credit facility that was subject to credit risk 
a increase in the interest rate on the balance outstanding under the new credit facility at december  would result in a change in our annual interest cost of approximately thousand
