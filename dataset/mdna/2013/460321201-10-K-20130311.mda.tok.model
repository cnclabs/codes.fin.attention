risks relating to our recent acquisition of uos we may be unable to successfully integrate uos s business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
we are operating uos as a separate subsidiary managed by its pre acquisition management team 
we have been devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of uos with our operations 
potential difficulties that we may encounter in the integration process include the following lost sales if customers decide not to do business with us  the failure to retain key employees  and potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses  delays or regulatory issues associated with the acquisition 
for all these reasons  you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could distract our management or disrupt our ongoing business  which could in turn adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers  vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 
we expect to incur integration expenses related to the uos acquisition 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur certain expenses in connection with integrating many of uos s operations  policies and procedures with ours 
these expenses include wage and benefit increases necessary to integrate uos s non union personnel into our unions 
while we have assumed that a certain amount of integration expenses will continue to be incurred  there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses 
any additional future acquisitions of vessels or businesses by us would subject us to additional business  operating and industry risks  the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated  and could adversely impact our capital structure 
from time to time in the future we may pursue other acquisition opportunities in an effort to implement our business strategies 
acquisitions may be of individual or groups of vessels or of businesses 
to the extent we acquire a business that is financially unstable or is otherwise subject to a high level of risk  we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that business 
accordingly  there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular business or assets that we may acquire 
in addition  the financing of any future acquisition completed by us could adversely impact our capital structure as any such financing would likely include the issuance of additional securities or the borrowing of additional funds 
except as required by law or the rules of any securities exchange on which our securities might be listed at the time we seek to consummate an acquisition  we do not expect to ask our stockholders to vote on any proposed acquisition

in  the segment began to feel the impact of the current economic recession and reported lower than expected gross voyage profit results 
the lower results were further dampened by the loss of one of the segment s largest customers in december of as a result  the company has routinely performed an impairment test in prior periods and determined based on the projected results it could recover the carrying value of the assets 
however  based on the challenge to replace the major customer lost in  a lack of improvement throughout  and no improvement expected in the short term for the segment s operating results  the company determined that the cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived assets of its rail ferry segment are less than the carrying amount of these assets 
the fair value of these assets was estimated based upon an independent third party appraiser level inputs 
during the second quarter of we recorded a non cash impairment loss of million on one of our international flag container vessels

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions  judgments  and opinions of management 
following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application 
for a description of all of the company s material accounting policies  see note a to the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item voyage revenue and expense recognition we currently generate our revenue from time charters and voyage charters 
time charter revenue is for a specific period of time at a specific rate per day  and is generally not as complex or as subjective as voyage charters 
revenues and expenses relating to our rail ferry and jones act segment s voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
our voyage expenses are estimated at the beginning of the voyages based on historical actual costs or from industry sources familiar with those types of charges 
as the voyage progresses  these estimated costs are revised with actual charges and timely adjustments are made 
the expenses are ratably expensed over the voyage based on the number of days in progress at the end of the period 
based on our experience  we believe there is no material difference between recording estimated expenses ratably over the voyage versus recording expenses as incurred 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require limited estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
vessel lives and depreciation the carrying value of each of our vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased  less depreciation and or impairment charges  if applicable 
we depreciate our vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated based on the type and age of the vessel 
see note a summary of significant accounting policies 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual salvage value 
salvage  or scrap  value is based on a vessel s lightweight tonnage lwt multiplied by a scrap rate to compute each vessel s salvage value 
we apply an initial scrap rate equal to the average applicable scrap rates for the months preceding the date the vessel is initially placed in service 
an increase in the useful life of a vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge 
on the other hand  a decrease in the useful life of a vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
the useful life and scrap value of all our vessels are reviewed every three years or when specific events or changes occur 
specifically  every three years the scrap value is reviewed and compared to the most recent three year average of steel prices 
the review was performed for the fiscal year with adjustments to our salvage values reflecting the latest three year average for steel prices 
see note a for more details 
if management feels an adjustment is warranted  the salvage value is adjusted based on this updated steel price 
due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying amounts of our vessels for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a particular vessel may not be recoverable 
the carrying values of the vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time because the market prices of vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates  second hand vessel sales  the cost of vessels and various other factors discussed in this report 
we record impairment losses only when events occur that cause us to believe that the future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value 
in such instances  we would recognize an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel s carrying amount  and the fair value is below the carrying amount 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  we must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
we test our long lived assets on an individual basis for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the vessel s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
there are two methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings a the deferral method where drydocking costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period of the next scheduled drydock  and b expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred 
we use the deferral method of accounting for drydock costs 
under the deferral method  drydock costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis until the estimated date of the next drydock 
we believe the deferral method better matches costs with revenue rather than expensing the costs as incurred 
we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks performed  depending on the age and type of vessel  its cargoes and other criteria 
typically  we estimate the date between drydockings to be between and months 
if circumstances change  we will change the length of the amortization period  which can result in adjustments to the amortization of drydock expense 
costs capitalized as part of the drydocking include direct costs that are incurred as part of the drydocking to meet regulatory requirements 
major expenditures that add economic life to the vessel  increase the vessel s earnings capacity or improve the vessel s efficiency are depreciated over the remaining economic life of the vessel 
direct costs include the shipyard costs  parts  inspection fees  steel  blasting and painting 
expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs  whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not  are expensed as incurred 
unamortized drydocking costs of vessels that are sold are written off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or loss in the period of the vessel s sale 
self retention insurance we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estimated potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  historical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual defense and settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we believe that insurance and the indemnification of a previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will partially mitigate our exposure 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant employment history with the company 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc topic asc 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
as described further in item of this report  our qualifying us flag operations are taxed under the tonnage tax regime rather than under the us corporate income tax regime 
certain foreign operations are exempt from foreign income taxation under existing provisions of the laws of those jurisdictions 
pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain foreign operations will be subject to us income tax when those earnings are repatriated 
our intention has been and remains to indefinitely re invest   and  of our  and respective foreign earnings losses excluded in our foreign subsidiaries  and accordingly  have not provided deferred taxes against those earnings 
the principal reasons for this position are as follows maintenance of international flag fleet  future expansion of international flag fleet and us flag fleet s operating cash flow needs are adequately met by its operations 
the american taxpayer relief act of  enacted on january   extended the active financing exception from subpart f income 
the extension was retroactive from january  through december  for  the company has reflected its active financing income as a  reduction to its current year us net operating loss 
during the first quarter of  the company s us net operating loss carryforward will be increased by the  to reflect the retroactive application of the new law 
see note j income taxes 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
during the deferred tax assets created by the continued losses of the us filing group resulting in the company moving to an overall net deferred tax asset position 
based on the above factors  it was determined that the establishment of a valuation allowance was warranted 
the valuation allowance was recorded  with the net deferred tax asset being reduced to zero as of december  the company s position has not changed during and the valuation allowance remains in effect as of december   with the net deferred tax asset remaining at a zero balance 
the establishment of the valuation allowance results in a higher effective tax rate for   and in considering the need both for establishment and continuation of a valuation allowance  the company gave consideration to the following factors the company files a consolidated u 
s 
corporate income tax return for its eligible domestic members 
exclusive of the tonnage tax companies  this group has experienced book losses for the three year period 
the book losses have translated into net operating losses for us tax reporting 
notwithstanding the above information  a recent acquisition could result in the company changing its assessment of the realization of its deferred tax assets to a more likely than not position 
if such a change were to happen  it would result in the company s recognition of these tax benefits 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities under asc topic  in order to consider a derivative instrument as a hedge  i we must designate the instrument as a hedge of future transactions  and ii the instrument must reduce our exposure to the applicable risk 
if the above criteria are not met  we must record the fair market value of the instrument at the end of each period and recognize the related gain or loss through earnings 
if the instrument qualifies as a hedge  net settlements under the agreement are recognized as an adjustment to earnings  while changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recorded through stockholders equity in other comprehensive income loss 
we currently employ  or have employed in the recent past  interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency contracts 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by asc topic these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation rates  rate of compensation increases  and expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
asc topic requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under asc topic  actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the measurement date  the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured  is required to be the company s fiscal year end 
impairment of investments our holdings in marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are thus carried on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in carrying value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the investments are sold 
we review these investments and our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment when there is evidence that fair value may be below the carrying value 
we write down an investment if fair value is below the carrying value and the impairment is other than temporary 
if we determine that a material decline in fair value below the carrying value is other than temporary  we would record a noncash impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which that determination is made 
the carrying value of that investment would then be written down to its fair value at the end of that period  establishing a new cost basis 
in determining the fair value of an investment and assessing whether any identified impairment is other than temporary  we use significant estimates and considerable judgments 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
business combinations and goodwill we account for business combinations by using the acquisition method of accounting which requires  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis  but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition  will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill 
all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the administrative and general expenses section of the income statement 
executive summary overall strategy we operate a diversified fleet of us and international flag vessels that provide international and domestic maritime transportation services to commercial and governmental customers primarily under medium to long term contracts 
our business strategy consists of identifying growth opportunities as market needs change  utilizing our extensive experience to meet those needs  maintaining a diverse portfolio of medium to long term contracts  and maintaining strong relations with our long standing customer base by providing quality transportation services 
overview as expected  proved to be a very challenging year for most shipping companies 
international dry bulk rates were reduced to historically low levels primarily due to weaker demand driven by continuing global economic uncertainties 
we believe this climate of uncertainty continues to have an impact on our industry 
on the supply side  overcapacity pressured ship owners to reduce their fleets and order books as prevailing charter rates were insufficient to support an adequate return on investments 
in addition  companies were impacted by a reduction in funding sources as financial institutions began to tighten credit available to shipping companies  which not only drove the cost of financing higher but also led to stricter loan covenants 
our strategy has proven to be effective 
we maintain a diversified business portfolio with medium to long term revenue streams while identifying growth opportunities as market needs change 
this strategy has enabled us over the years to mitigate the cyclicality of the shipping industry 
in the first quarter of  we consummated two significant transactions the sale and leaseback of one pctc and the outright sale of two pctc s 
from these two transactions we generated million in proceeds  paid down approximately million in debt and reacquired at a discount our previously leased molten sulphur carrier for approximately million under an early buy out arrangement 
these transactions not only provided us with more cash but deleveraged our balance sheet for future growth 
for both the second and third quarters  we continued to recognized positive earnings and generated positive operating cash flows despite weakening in prevailing dry bulk rates 
in mid september  the msc terminated the contract which employed our ice strengthened built multi purpose vessel and redelivered the vessel 
annual revenues under this terminated contract were estimated to be approximately million 
the vessel is currently employed under a spot market basis 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we acquired uos for total consideration of approximately million consisted of a million cash payment and the assumption of million in current liability subject to customary working capital adjustments  making us the largest jones act dry bulk operator by capacity and the only operator with handysize dry bulk vessels in the coastwise trade and self unloading barges in the gulf of mexico 
we financed the acquisition through a combination of a bank term loan  draws on our line of credit  two sale leaseback transactions and available cash 
for further information on the acquisition of uos  see footnote b 
the uos transaction was our largest corporate acquisition since we purchased waterman in with this acquisition  we expect an increase in our fixed revenues attributed to medium to long term contracts from of revenues in to approximately of revenues in the scale and diversity of the uos fleet provides us scheduling flexibility that is expected to enhance vessel utilization and offers customers a range of vessel types and sizes 
in addition  the acquisition further solidifies our strategy of maintaining key credit worthy customers that generate stable revenues and cash flows 
also  in the fourth quarter of we completed the sale of one of our built pctc s and an additional sale leaseback transaction for working capital purposes 
the sale of our built pctc positioned us to acquire a built pctc 
for further information on the pctc transaction see footnote f 
change in segments following our acquisition of uos in late  we internally restructured our business to reorganize our prior operating segments listed below with the following new segments new segments prior segments jones act time charter contracts us flag pure car truck carriers time charter contracts international flag dry bulk carriers contracts of affreightment rail ferry rail ferry service specialty contracts other other the new segmentation  which is effective beginning with the fourth quarter of  is based primarily by the market in which the segment assets are deployed  the physical characteristics of those assets  and the type of services provided to our customers 
we believe this reorganization will better align our segment disclosures with the information now reviewed by our chief operating decision maker and believe it improves the transparency with which we communicate to our investors 
all prior period data for each of our segments has been restated based on this new segmentation methodology 
consolidated financial performance for the full year  net income was million  a decrease of million as compared to full year reflected in the results was a million gain resulting from vessel sales in the first quarter and like kind exchange in fourth quarter

table of contents the majority of our revenues are derived from medium to long term contracts  which generally provide us with fixed income streams and predictable cash flows  subject to off hire time 
as of march  excluding charter s options the average remaining term of our contracts deploying jones act vessels was three years  the average remaining term of our contracts deploying pctc s was four years  the average remaining term of our contracts in our specialty contracts segment was two years 
in addition to contractually fixed income  we also earn income as a result of chartering our us flag pctc s back for the carriage of supplemental cargo when available 
because of recent downturns in our revenues and the overall condition of the global economy  we test our long lived assets quarterly to determine whether or not our projected cash flows exceed the vessel s carrying amount 
based on this assessment  we believe that no impairments existed at december  management gross voyage profit financial measures in connection with discussing the results of our various operating segments in this report  we refer to gross voyage profit  a metric that management reviews to assist in monitoring and managing our business

jones act overall segment revenues increased by or million when comparing to the increase was due to the addition of million of revenues generated by the uos vessels in december of  partially offset by slightly lower revenues generated by our incumbent jones act vessels 
the segment s gross voyage profit increased from million in to million in  also primarily due to the addition of the uos vessels  and reduced operating costs 
pure car truck carriers overall segment revenues decreased by or million when comparing to the decrease was driven primarily by the sale of two pctc s in the first quarter of the segment s gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in  also due primarily to the sale 
our fixed contract revenues for this segment were million and million in and  respectively 
our variable revenues of million and million for the same periods in and  respectively  represent revenues derived from supplemental cargoes

for additional information  see items a and a of this report and note a appearing at page f of this report 
gain loss on sale of investments increased from a  loss in to a gain of  in this was primarily due to a gain on the sale of marketable securities in  contrasted with a loss on the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated entity in other income from vessel financing decreased from million in to million in due to lower interest earned on a note receivable relating to vessels we sold to an indonesian company in the third quarter of investment income decreased from  in to  in due to higher cash balances in  higher average balances of interest bearing debt securities in  and an adjustment on returns for the prior year 
foreign exchange gain of million in  an increase from a million loss in  is associated with the yen financing of a pctc 
the gain is due to the revaluation of our yen denominated loan and the weakening of the value of the yen since the end of the exchange gain was based on a change in the exchange rate of yen to usd at december  compared to yen to usd at december  see item a risk factors 
income taxes we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  on our million of income before equity in net loss income of unconsolidated entities for the year ended december  for the year ended december  our provision for income tax benefit was  on our million of income before equity in net income loss of unconsolidated entities 
this favorable change resulted from a decrease in required valuation allowance referable to a current year business acquisition and a reduction in foreign withholding tax

prior to us acquiring of dry bulk on march   we reported our proportionate interest in dry bulk using the equity method 
as a result of the step acquisition  dry bulk s results are now consolidated in our dry bulk carriers segment 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities decreased from million at december  to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased during by million to a total of million 
this decrease was due to cash provided by operating activities of million and investing activities of  offset with cash used by financing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for was generated after adjusting for the items listed in our consolidated statements of cash flows  including non cash items such as i depreciation of million  ii amortization of deferred charges and other assets of million offset by i a million gain on a foreign currency exchange related to the revaluation of our yen denominated loan facility  ii a million gain on the purchase sale of assets and iii drydocking payments of million 
net cash provided by investing activities of million included capital expenditures of million  million related to the acquisitions of fsi  tower and uos  an increase of million in restricted cash as required by a loan to value covenant in connection with our yen denominated facility  and investments in unconsolidated entities of million  offset by principal payments received under direct financing leases of million  million of proceeds from the sale of assets  million from proceeds from sales of marketable securities and million from cash received on note receivables

these debt payments and our cash dividends payments of million were partially offset by proceeds of million from the final bank draw on a term loan for a handymax bulk carrier delivered in january of  million for uos vessels and total draws on our line of credit of million 
as of december   we had outstanding on our line of credit  of which  million was repaid in early january  of the million of cash and cash equivalents reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   approximately  is held overseas and is subject to our non repatriation commitment discussed under the heading tax matters in item of this annual report 
consequently  these funds are not available for use in the united states 
we have filed with the securities and exchange commission a million universal shelf registration statement  which we believe provides us with flexibility to access the public equity and debt markets 
this shelf registration statement expires in october  and it is our intent to extend it 
we routinely evaluate the acquisition of additional vessels or businesses and from time to time evaluate possible vessel divestitures 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisitions or dispositions 
we generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a definitive agreement 
we may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions  the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations 
stock repurchase program on january   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to a total of  shares of our common stock 
we expect that any share repurchases under this program will be made from time to time for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices 
the timing and amount of any purchases under the program will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
thereafter  we suspended repurchases until the second quarter of  when we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
since then we have not repurchased any other shares 
unless and until the board otherwise provides  this authorization will remain open indefinitely  or until we reach the  share limit 

table of contents debt and lease obligations as of december   we held seven vessels under operating contracts  seven vessels under bareboat charter or lease agreements and two vessels under time charter agreements 
the types of vessels held under these agreements include i a molten sulphur carrier and an integrated tug and barge unit operating in our jones act segment  ii three pure car truck carriers that operate under our pctc segment  iii two handysize bulk carriers that operate in our dry bulk carrier segment  and iv three multi purpose vessels  a tanker and five container vessels  all of which operate in our specialty contracts segment 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities 
we have lease agreements on our offices in mobile  al  new york  ny  tampa  fl and shanghai  china  which expire in april  june  august  and september  respectively 
on february   we completed a sale and leaseback transaction with wells fargo bank northwest  national association  of our built pctc 
the transaction generated gross proceeds of million  which we used to pay down debt of million 
we are leasing the vessel back under a ten year lease agreement with early buyout options that can be exercised in and this lease is classified as an operating lease  with the million gain on this sale leaseback being deferred and recognized over the term of the lease 
on june   we negotiated the early buy out of the operating lease related to our molten sulphur carrier 
on november   we sold this vessel to bmo harris equipment finance company for approximately million cash and commenced a seven year lease agreement with an early buy out option that can be exercised in this lease is classified as an operating lease  with the million gain on this sale leaseback being deferred and recognized over the term of the lease 
also on november  we sold a built pctc to capital source bank for approximately million cash and commenced a six year lease agreement with an early buy out option that can be exercised in this lease is classified as an operating lease  with the million gain on this sale leaseback being deferred and recognized over the term of the lease 
the company used the net proceeds of approximately million from the november  transactions to finance a portion of the purchase price for the company s acquisition of uos  which was completed on november  on december   we sold a built pctc to bb t equipment finance for million cash and commenced a six year lease agreement with an early buy out option that can be exercised in and again in this lease is classified as an operating lease 
included in the acquisition of uos was one integrated tug barge unit under an operating lease 
this lease will expire in december of and we have the right to buy back the unit up to the lease expiration date in december we intend to continue to operate all of the aforementioned leased vessels under their respective charters and contracts 
annual rent payments due under the new lease agreements can be found in the table below 
see our fleet listings on page for a complete list of vessels 
our operating lease agreements have fair value renewal options and fair value purchase options 
most of the agreements impose defined minimum working capital and net worth requirements  impose restrictions on the payment of dividends  and prohibit us from incurring  without prior written consent  additional debt or lease obligations  except as defined 
debt covenants substantially all of our credit agreements require us to comply with various loan covenants  including financial covenants that require minimum levels of net worth  working capital and interest expense coverage and a maximum amount of debt leverage 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants related to its debt obligations and we believe  based on current circumstances  that it is likely that we will continue to meet such covenants in the near future 
the following table represents the actual and required covenant amounts for the twelve months ending december  actual required net worth thousands of dollars working capital thousands of dollars interest expense coverage ratio minimum leverage ratio ebitda maximum ebitdar to fixed charges total indebtedness leverage ratio ebitdar maximum total assets less goodwill minus total liabilities 
total current assets minus total current liabilities

defined as the ratio between consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
defined as the ratio between fixed charges to consolidated ebitdar defined as the ratio between adjusted unconsolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitdar 
in the unanticipated event that our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital  enter into financings of our unencumbered vessels or restructure debt 
based on current circumstances we believe we can continue to fund our working capital and routine capital investment liquidity needs through cash flow from operations and or accessing available lines of credit 
to the extent we are required to seek additional capital  our efforts could be hampered by the on going uncertainty in the credit markets 
see item a  risk factors 
we presently have variable to fixed interest rate swaps on of our long term debt

during  while the financial markets continued to be buffeted by market volatility  due to the concerted efforts of the federal reserve  ecb governors and other finance ministers in other parts of the world  some calm was restored back into the markets 
as we continuously evaluate our pension plan investment diversification  we worked with our outside investment consultants and added new category funds as well as replaced or altered the percentage of dollar investment placed in our current funds in our portfolio 
we also increased our equity exposure 
our new pension benchmark mix is equities and fixed instruments 
the additions of certain actively managed funds were selected to enhance our current passively managed selections 
we contributed  to our pension fund for the plan year to help offset an increase in future liabilities which was mainly driven by a reduction in the discount rate used in their calculation 
this rate is established by the market 
we will continue to monitor the pension plan quarterly with our investment consultants and will make any necessary adjustments at that time 
we are currently in a funded status 
see note i employee benefit plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts  and in the past we have also utilized commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december  is not material 
we have entered into two interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  one in september and one in january through the acquisition of dbch we assumed an interest rate swap agreement  which began in january in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
for each of these agreements  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates  and our weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is a liability of million 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in a million liability 
commodity price risk as of december   we did not have commodity swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to the risk of increases in the price of fuel necessary to operate both our rail ferry and jones act segments 
we have fuel surcharges and escalation adjustments in place for both segments  which we believe managed the price risk for those services during we estimate that a increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately  in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding decrease of approximately in our basic earnings per share based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  the additional fuel costs assume no additional revenue would be generated from fuel surcharges  even though we believe that we could have passed on to our customers some or all of the fuel price increases through the aforementioned fuel surcharges during the same period  subject to the need to maintain competitive freight rates 
our charterers in the pctc s  dry bulk carriers and specialty contracts segments are responsible for purchasing vessel fuel requirements under governing time charters  thus  our fuel price risk is limited to any voyage charters concluded within our dry bulk carriers segment 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase commitments during these contracts mature on various dates during the fair value of these contracts at december   is a liability of  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates would be a liability of  on january   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into a senior secured term loan facility denominated in japanese yen for the purchase of a ceu pctc  which was completed and delivered in march the decision to enter into this yen loan was driven by the lower yen interest rates versus the usd interest rates at that time 
subsequently  we entered into a yen interest rate swap the facility designed to cap the interest at 
in june  we received notification that the banking institution would be exercising their option to reduce the yen financing on this vessel from to of the delivered vessel cost 
the loan was fully drawn in march to the full amount available of yen  under current accounting guidelines  since this facility is not denominated in our functional currency  the outstanding balance of the facility as of the end of each reporting period is to be revalued  with any adjustments recorded to earnings 
due to the amount of the facility  we may sustain fluctuations that may cause material swings in our reported results 
as an example  a hypothetical to yen increase or decrease on the exchange rate between the us dollar and yen  which was to yen at december   would impact our earnings by approximately  to million for the reporting period see item a risk factors 
while we believe that these fluctuations may smooth out over time  any particular reporting period could be materially impacted by these adjustments 
there was a depreciation in the yen to usd exchange rate at december  compared to december   resulting in a million foreign exchange gain for the year ended december   reported under interest and other on our consolidated statement of income 
we continue to monitor the movements in the foreign currency markets in order to take advantage of potential opportunities to minimize our yen currency risk 
from time to time over the past year  the japanese government has intervened in the foreign currency market in an attempt to weaken the value of the yen 
we bought forward contracts to purchase yen to cover our installments due under the facility for the periods march  through december  on november   we purchased million yen to cover the march  installment for to usd  or a usd equivalent of  on november   we purchased million yen to cover the june  installment for to usd  or a usd equivalent of  on december   we purchased million yen to cover the september  installment for to usd  or a usd equivalent of  and on december   we purchased million yen to cover the december  installment for to usd  or a usd equivalent of
