item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  segments to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents acquisition and development strategy acquisitions we seek to acquire high quality  well located communities with modern floor plans and amenities 
our ideal acquisition targets generally are located in markets that have stable or increasing collegiate populations and high barriers to entry 
we also seek to acquire investments in collegiate housing communities that possess sound market fundamentals but are under performing and would benefit from re positioning  renovation and or improved property management 
we consider the following property and market factors to identify potential property acquisitions university and campus reputation  competitive admissions criteria  limited number of on campus beds and limited plans for expansion  distance of property from campus  property unit mix  competition  significant out of state enrollment  past operating performance  potential for improved management  ownership and capital structure  presence of desired amenities  maintenance and condition of the property  access to a university sponsored or public transportation line depending on location  and parking availability 
conversely  subject to appropriate market conditions  we may dispose of certain non strategic collegiate housing communities 
we continually assess all of our communities  the markets in which they are located and the colleges and universities they serve  to determine if any dispositions are necessary or appropriate 
developments we develop collegiate housing communities for our ownership  and we plan to increase self development activity going forward 
the on campus equity plan  or the one plan sm  is our private equity program for universities  which allows universities to use the edr equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their credit capacity for other campus projects 
the one plan sm offers one service provider and one equity source to universities seeking to modernize on campus housing to meet the needs of today s students 
edr has completed the development of wholly owned collegiate housing communities located on the campus of syracuse university in syracuse  new york 
the trust owns and manages the communities under a long term ground lease from syracuse university 
edr is also currently developing a high rise apartment community on university land at the university of texas at austin campus under the one plan sm 
edr will own and manage the community under a long term ground lease from the university of texas 
in december  we were selected by the university of kentucky uk to develop  own and manage a multi phase project aimed at revitalizing uk s on campus housing which could potentially include the revitalization and replacement of uk entire campus housing portfolio and expansion of such to over  beds within five to seven years utilizing the one plan sm 
construction on central hall  the first building in the multi phase project  is progressing as planned 
in the fourth quarter of  edr received approval from the uk board of trustees and began construction on phase ii of the project  which will include four communities with  beds 
we believe the trust will continue to enter into more partnerships under the one plan sm due to our years of success in the collegiate housing business 
the one plan sm allows us to provide the perfect opportunity to universities to develop new housing and boost enrollment with a plan tailored to specific needs while simultaneously preserving the university s credit capacity 
in total  we currently have eleven active owned developments delivering in and this includes wholly owned developments at the university of connecticut and university of colorado 

table of contents joint ventures starting in  we began entering into joint venture agreements to develop  own and manage properties near the university of alabama  which opened in august  and arizona state university and university of mississippi  which are both expected to open in the summer of we have the majority ownership interest in each property 
in some cases  we hold a minority ownership interest in properties and earn a fee for the management of the properties 
in december the trust invested in a collegiate housing development with gem realty capital to jointly develop and own new off campus collegiate housing 
the trust is a owner and will manage the community once the development is completed 
this strategy enables us to source and take advantage of opportunities not otherwise available and to accretively diversify our portfolio by expanding into geographic markets where we are not currently present with lower capital requirements than if we acquired the properties on our own 
we expect to continue pursuing joint venture arrangements in the future 
operating strategy we seek to maximize net operating income of the collegiate housing communities that we own and manage through the following operational strategies 
controlling costs 
we seek to maximize property level profitability through the use of cost control systems and our focused on site management personnel 
some of our specific cost control initiatives include establishing internal controls and procedures for consistent cost control throughout our communities  operating with flat property level management structures  minimizing multiple layers of management  and negotiating service level pricing arrangements with national and regional vendors and requiring corporate level approval of service agreements for each community 
maintain and develop strategic relationships 
we believe that establishing and maintaining relationships with universities and developers  owners and brokers of collegiate housing properties is important to the ongoing success of our business 
we believe that these relationships will continue to provide us with referrals that enhance our leasing efforts  opportunities for additional acquisitions of collegiate housing communities and contracts for third party services 
proactive marketing practices 
we have developed and implemented proactive marketing practices to enhance the visibility of our collegiate housing communities and to optimize our revenue 
we study our competitors  our residents and university policies affecting enrollment and housing 
based on our findings at each property  we formulate a marketing and sales plan for each academic leasing period 
this plan is closely monitored and adjusted  if necessary  throughout the leasing period using our pilot leasing management system 
we intend to continue to market our properties to students  parents and universities by emphasizing collegiate oriented living areas  state of the art technology and infrastructure  a wide variety of amenities and services and close proximity to university campuses 
develop and retain personnel 
we staff each collegiate housing community that we own or manage with a full service on site property management team 
each of our property management teams includes community assistants who plan activities and interact with residents  enhancing their college experiences 
we have developed programs and procedures to train each team of on site employees and to provide them with corporate based support for each essential operating function 
to retain employees  we have developed an incentive based compensation structure that is available to all of our on site personnel 
third party services strategy in addition to developing communities for our ownership and managing our owned collegiate housing communities  we seek to provide development and management consulting services for universities and other third party owners who rely upon the private sector for assistance in developing and managing their collegiate housing properties 
we perform third party services in order to enhance our reputation with universities and to benefit our primary goal of owning high quality collegiate housing communities 
we perform third party services for collegiate housing communities serving some of the nation s most prominent systems of higher education  including the university of north carolina  the california state university system and the pennsylvania state system of higher education 
in order to comply with the rules applicable to our status as a reit  we provide our third party services through our development company and our management company 
unlike the income earned from our properties under the reit  the income earned by our development company and our management company is subject to regular federal income tax and state and local income taxes where applicable 

table of contents third party development consulting services we provide third party development consulting services primarily to universities seeking to modernize their on campus collegiate housing communities but also to other third party investors 
we typically are notified that we have been awarded development consulting services projects on the basis of a competitive award process and thereafter begin work on the project 
in the case of tax exempt bond financed projects  definitive contracts are not executed until bond closing 
our development consulting services typically include the following market analysis and evaluation of housing needs and options  cooperation with university in architectural design  negotiation of ground lease  development agreement  construction contract  architectural contract and bond documents  oversight of architectural design process  coordination of governmental and university plan approvals  oversight of construction process  design of layout  purchase and installation of furniture  pre opening marketing to potential residents  and obtaining final approvals of construction 
by providing these services  we are able to observe emerging trends in collegiate housing development and market acceptance of unit and community amenities 
our development consulting services also provide us with opportunities to obtain additional third party property management contracts 
of the clients we have provided development consulting services to since  we currently offer third party management services under contracts with of those clients while the remaining clients alternatively elected to manage the communities in house under their existing infrastructure 
in  our fees from third party development consulting services represented of our revenues  excluding operating expense reimbursements 
since  we have provided third party development consulting services to clients for projects totaling over billion in value 
we are currently providing third party development services pursuant to signed definitive contracts with projects under construction at mansfield university of pennsylvania  clarion university of pennsylvania and west chester university of pennsylvania 
the aggregate project cost of these three projects is estimated to be approximately million 
third party management services we provide third party management services for collegiate housing communities owned by educational institutions  charitable foundations and others 
our management services typically cover all aspects of operations  including residence life and student development  marketing  leasing administration  strategic relationships  information systems and accounting services 
these services are comparable to the services that we provide for our owned properties 
we typically provide these services pursuant to multi year management agreements 
these agreements usually have an initial term of two to five years with renewal options of like terms 
we believe that providing these services allows us to leverage our existing management expertise and infrastructure 
for the year ended december   our fees from third party management services represented of our revenue  excluding operating expense reimbursements

our operations we staff each of our owned and managed collegiate housing communities with a full service property management team 
we typically staff each property with one community manager  a marketing leasing manager  a resident services manager  a maintenance supervisor  one on site resident community assistant for each residents and general office and maintenance staff 
each property management team markets  leases and manages the community with a focus on maximizing its profitability 
in addition  each property management team is trained to provide social and developmental opportunities for residents  enhancing the residents college experiences as well as the desirability of our communities 
we have developed policies and procedures to carefully select and develop each team of on site employees and to provide each team with corporate based support for each essential operating area  including lease administration  sales marketing  
table of contents community and university relations  student life administration  maintenance  loss prevention  accounting  human resources benefits administration and information systems 
the corporate level personnel responsible for each of these areas support each community manager s leadership role and are available as a resource to the community managers around the clock 
residence life and student development our vice president of client relations designs and directs our residence life program 
our programs are developed at the corporate level and implemented at each community by our community assistants  together with our other on site personnel 
we provide educational  social and recreational activities designed to help students achieve academic goals  promote respect and harmony throughout the community and help bridge interaction with the respective university 
examples of our residence life and student development programs include community building and social activities geared to university related events  holidays  public safety and education  study and attention skills counseling  career development  resume writing and employment search skill training  sponsorship of intramural sport teams  academic clubs and alumni based activities  parent and resident appreciation events  community service activities including recycling  blood drives  food drives and student volunteer committees  lectures focused on social issues  including effective communication  multi cultural awareness and substance abuse  university outreach activities  and voter registration  enrollment and education 
the community assistants perform key roles in the administrative functioning of the community and interface with residents through constructive programs  activities and listening to resident interests and concerns 
our on site leadership selects residents to serve as community assistants who meet criteria established by our vice president of client relations 
marketing we begin our annual marketing campaign by thoroughly segmenting the student population attending each of the primary universities where our collegiate housing communities are located  and compiling market surveys of comparable collegiate apartment properties 
with this information  we formulate a marketing sales strategy that consists of a renewal campaign for current residents and a broader campaign directed at the eligible student population 
we assess university regulations regarding housing requirements to avoid targeting segments of the market in which students are not eligible to live off campus 
we typically begin our renewal campaign in october of each year 
signage  social networking  direct mailings to the students and their parents  appreciation parties and staff selling incentives are key elements of the renewal campaign 
the community assistant team plays a key role in communicating the renewal message throughout its assigned property area 
we use a database of current resident demographic data to direct sales information to primary feeder high schools  particularly where new freshmen are eligible to live off campus 
other database criteria include gender  high school location  prior apartment community  academic class standing  field of study and activity preferences 
we appeal to the greater university population through theme based newspaper advertising campaigns  open house activities  housing fairs conducted by the university  web based advertising and social networking media 
our professional leasing and marketing staff targets certain university sponsored on campus events to distribute handouts displaying our logo and offering incentives to visit our sales center 
wherever possible  our collegiate housing communities appear on university websites in listings of off campus housing options  together with banner advertising where available 
leasing our standard lease begins in mid august and runs for approximately months  ending july or early august to coincide with the university s fall academic term 
the primary exception to our standard lease term is our university towers and university village on colvin communities  which we generally rent on nine month academic year leases 
our standard lease is an agreement between the student and parental guarantor  and the specific collegiate housing community 
all leases are for a bed in a private or shared bedroom  with rights to share common areas within the unit and throughout the community 
this individual lease is a strong selling attraction as it limits a student s liability to the rental for one bedroom instead of burdening the student with shared liability for the entire unit rental amount 

table of contents we lease our units by floor plan type using pilot  our property leasing marketing system  to maximize full leasing of entire units  avoiding spotty vacancies particularly in the four bedroom units 
we offer roommate matching services to facilitate full occupancy 
we develop waiting lists and monitor popular floor plans that fill to capacity early in the leasing season 
if any fully vacant units remain available after the beginning of any academic semester  we seek to lease such units on a temporary basis to university related visitors and our tenants parents and family members  or keep them available for future leasing to students 
unlike conventional apartment communities that have monthly move outs and renewals  our collegiate housing community occupancies remain relatively stable throughout the academic year  but must be entirely re leased at the beginning of each academic year 
because of the nature of leasing to students  we are highly dependent upon the success of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season  generally october through august 
our leasing staff undergo intensive annual professional training to maximize the success of our leasing efforts 
we typically require rent to be paid in equal installments throughout the lease term  with the first installment due on july residents of university towers and residence halls that we manage for third parties typically pay their annual rent in two installments on july and december we replace contracted residents who fail to pay the first installment with people on our waiting list or from walk in traffic while the market is still active with students seeking housing at the commencement of the academic year 
strategic relationships we assign high priority to establishing and nurturing relationships with the administration of each of the primary universities where our collegiate housing communities are located 
our corporate staff establishes this network  and on site management then sustains it with follow up by corporate staff during routine visits to the community 
as a result of our strategic relationships  universities often refer their students to our properties  thus enhancing our leasing effort throughout the year 
these networks create goodwill for our collegiate housing communities throughout the university administration  including departments of admissions  student affairs  public safety  athletics and international affairs 
most universities promote off campus housing alternatives to their student population 
it is our intention to be among the most preferred off campus residences and for universities to include our communities in listings and literature provided to students 
we seek to obtain student mailing lists used by universities and to be featured in web based collegiate housing listings wherever permitted by the institution and incorporate these initiatives into our marketing efforts 
our community managers make scheduled personal visits to academic departments at the universities to further our community exposure at this level 
in addition to our university relationships  our management team has developed long standing relationships with developers  owners and brokers of collegiate housing properties that allow us to identify and capitalize on acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we have generated an internal database of contacts that we use to identify and evaluate acquisition candidates 
as it is our intention to develop a diverse portfolio of collegiate housing communities  we also develop strategic relationships with equity investors in order to pursue acquisitions through joint venture arrangements 
competition competition from universities we typically compete for student tenants with the owners of on campus collegiate housing  which is generally owned by educational institutions or charitable foundations 
educational institutions generally do not have to pay real estate taxes and borrow funds at lower interest rates  while we and other private sector operators pay full real estate tax rates and have higher borrowing costs 
the competitive advantages of on campus collegiate housing also include its physical proximity to the university campus and captive student body 
moreover  many universities have policies requiring students to live in their on campus facilities during their freshman year 
on campus housing is limited  however  and most universities are able to house only a small percentage of their students 
as a result  educational institutions depend upon  and may serve as referral sources for  private providers of off campus housing 
in addition  off campus housing facilities tend to offer more relaxed rules and regulations than on campus properties and therefore tend to be more appealing to students 
off campus collegiate housing offers freedom from restrictions  such as quiet hours or gender visitation limitations  and is especially appealing to upperclassmen who are transitioning towards independence 

table of contents competition from private owners we compete with several regional and national owner operators of off campus collegiate housing  including two publicly traded competitors  american campus communities  inc acc and campus crest communities  inc ccg 
we also compete with privately held developers and other real estate firms and in a number of markets with smaller local owner operators 
currently  the industry is fragmented with no participant holding a dominant market share 
we believe that a number of other large national companies with substantial financial resources may be potential entrants into the collegiate housing business 
the entry of one or more of these companies could increase competition for residents and for the acquisition  management and development of collegiate housing properties 
environmental matters as a current or prior owner  manager and developer of real estate  we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties 
environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contaminants  and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances can be substantial 
the liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party 
the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third party liability for personal injury or property damage  or adversely affect our ability to sell  lease or develop the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral 
these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item a 
risk factors below 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees  including  on site employees  including community assistants  people in our property management services department  people in our development consulting services and construction departments  and executive  corporate administration and financial personnel

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our properties  our business and the real estate industry our performance and the value of our real estate assets are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
our performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders depends on our ability to generate cash revenues in excess of expenses  scheduled debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements 
events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties 
these events include local oversupply of collegiate housing units  increased competition or reduction in demand for collegiate housing  inability to collect rent from tenants  the need for capital expenditures at our communities  vacancies or our inability to lease beds on favorable terms  inability to finance property development and acquisitions on favorable terms  increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  utilities and real estate taxes  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments  changing student demographics  decreases in student enrollment at particular colleges and universities  changes in university policies related to admissions  national  regional and local economic conditions  and rising interest rates 
our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact tenant leasing practices 
our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact tenant leasing practices 
a continuation of ongoing adverse economic conditions affecting disposable tenant income  such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates  tax rates  fuel and energy costs and other matters  could reduce overall tenant leasing or cause tenants to shift their leasing practices 
at this time  it is difficult to determine the breadth and duration of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our tenants and our business in general 
a general reduction in the level of tenant leasing could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
we own  directly or indirectly  interests in collegiate housing communities located near major universities in the united states 
accordingly  we are dependent upon the levels of student enrollment and the admission policies of the respective universities  which attract a significant portion of our leasing base 
as a result of the overall market quality deterioration  many students may be unable to obtain student loans on favorable terms 
if student loans are not available or their costs are prohibitively high  enrollment numbers for universities may decrease 
the demand for  occupancy rates at  rental income from and value of our properties would be adversely affected if student enrollment levels become stagnant or decrease in the current environment 
accordingly  a continuation or further worsening of these difficult financial and macroeconomic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows  profitability and results of operations 
our results of operations are subject to the following risks inherent in the collegiate housing industry leasing cycles  concentrated lease up period  seasonal cash flows and increased risk of student defaults during the summer months of month leases 
we generally lease our properties under month leases  but we may also lease for terms of nine months or less 
furthermore  all of our properties must be entirely re leased each year  exposing us to increased leasing risk 
we may not be able to relet the property on similar terms  if we are able to relet the property at all 
the terms of renewal or re lease including the cost of required renovations and or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than the prior lease 
if we are unable to relet all or a substantial portion of our properties  or if the rental rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected rates  our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected 

table of contents in addition  we are subject to increased leasing risk on properties that we acquire that we have not previously managed due to our lack of experience leasing those properties and unfamiliarity with their leasing cycles 
collegiate housing communities are typically leased during a leasing season that begins in november and ends in august of each year 
we are therefore highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts and personnel during this season 
prior to the commencement of each new lease period  mostly during the first two weeks of august but also during september at some communities  we prepare the units for new incoming tenants 
other than revenue generated by in place leases for returning tenants  we do not generally recognize lease revenue during this period referred to as turn as we have no leases in place 
in addition  during turn  we incur significant expenses making our units ready for occupancy  which we recognize immediately 
this lease turn period results in seasonality in our operating results during the third quarter of each year 
as a result  we may experience significantly reduced cash flows during the summer months at properties leased for terms shorter than twelve months 
in addition  students leasing under month leases may be more likely to default on their rental payments during the summer months 
although we typically require a student s parents to guarantee the student s lease  we may have to spend considerable effort and expense in pursuing payment upon a defaulted lease  and our efforts may not be successful 
we rely on our relationships with universities  and changes in university personnel and or policies could adversely affect our operating results 
in some cases  we rely on our relationships with universities for referrals of prospective tenants or for mailing lists of prospective tenants and their parents 
the failure to maintain good relationships with personnel at these universities could therefore have a material adverse effect on us 
if universities refuse to make their lists of prospective student tenants and their parents available to us or increase the costs of these lists  the increased costs or failure to obtain such lists could also have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be adversely affected by a change in university admission policies 
for example  if a university reduces the number of student admissions  the demand for our properties may be reduced and our occupancy rates may decline 
in addition  universities may institute a policy that a certain class of students  such as freshmen  must live in a university owned facility  which would also reduce the demand for our properties 
while we may engage in marketing efforts to compensate for such policy changes  we may not be able to effect such marketing efforts prior to the commencement of the annual lease up period or at all 
it is also important that the universities from which our communities draw tenants maintain good reputations and are able to attract the desired number of incoming students 
any degradation in a university s reputation could inhibit its ability to attract students and reduce the demand for our communities 
we face significant competition from university owned collegiate housing and from other private collegiate housing communities located within close proximity to universities 
many students prefer on campus housing to off campus housing because of the closer physical proximity to campus and integration of on campus facilities into the academic community 
universities can generally avoid real estate taxes and borrow funds at lower interest rates  while we and other private sector operators pay full real estate tax rates and have higher borrowing costs 
consequently  universities often can offer more convenient and or less expensive collegiate housing than we can  which can adversely affect our occupancy and rental rates 
we also compete with other national and regional owner operators of off campus collegiate housing in a number of markets as well as with smaller local owner operators 
there are a number of purpose built collegiate housing properties that compete directly with us located near or in the same general vicinity of many of our collegiate housing communities 
such competing collegiate housing communities may be newer than our collegiate housing communities  located closer to campus  charge less rent  possess more attractive amenities  or offer more services  shorter lease terms or more flexible leases 
the construction of competing properties or decreases in the general levels of rents for housing in competing properties could adversely affect our rental income 
we believe that a number of other large national companies may be potential entrants in the collegiate housing business 
in some cases  these potential competitors possess substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
the entry of one or more of these companies could increase competition for student tenants and for the acquisition  development and management of other collegiate housing communities 

table of contents we may not be able to recover our costs for our development consulting services 
we typically are awarded development consulting services business on the basis of a competitive award process  but definitive contracts are typically not executed until the formal approval of the transaction by the institution s governing body at the completion of the process 
in the intervening period  we may incur significant predevelopment and other costs in the expectation that the development consulting services contract will be executed 
these costs could range up to million or more per project and typically include architects fees to design the property and contractors fees to price the construction 
we typically seek to enter into a reimbursement agreement with the institution that requires the institution to provide a guarantee of our advances 
however  we may not be successful in negotiating such an agreement 
in addition  if an institution s governing body does not ultimately approve our selection and the underlying terms of a pending development  we may not be able to recover these costs from the institution 
in addition  when we are awarded development consulting business  we generally receive a significant percentage of our fees for development consulting services upon closing of the project financing  a portion of the fee over the construction period and the balance upon substantial completion of construction 
as a result  the recognition and timing of revenues will  among other things differ from the timing of payments and be contingent upon the project owner s successful structuring and closing of the project financing as well as the timing of construction 
our contractual obligations arising under third party development consulting agreements expose us to risks related to the total project cost and on time completion of the project 
we typically enter into development agreements with universities and other third parties as developer at risk 
at the same time  we enter into guaranteed maximum price contracts with a general contractor for the construction of the project 
in our capacity as developer at risk  we usually guarantee that a project will be completed within a certain maximum cost 
any additional costs which are not the responsibility of the contractor  under their guaranteed maximum price contract  or the result of changes by the university or other third party  would be our responsibility to fund 
we also typically guarantee that a project will be completed and ready for occupancy by a date certain in order to meet housing needs for a particular school term 
if completion of a project was delayed beyond such date certain  we would be exposed to claims for liquidated damages  which would usually include  but may not be limited to  the cost of housing prospective residents of the community until it was available for occupancy 
although we generally transfer such risks to the general contractor who is responsible for the construction activities of a development project  if we were to experience significant cost overruns or were to become subject to such a claim or claims  our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted 
we may not be able to recover internal development costs 
when developing collegiate housing communities for our ownership on university land  definitive contracts are not executed until the formal approval of the transaction by the institution s governing body at the completion of the process 
in the intervening period  we may incur significant predevelopment and other costs in the expectation that a ground lease will be executed 
these costs could range up to million or more and typically include architects fees to design the property and third party fees related to other predevelopment services 
if an institution s governing body does not ultimately approve the lease we will not be able to recover these predevelopment costs 
we may be unable to take advantage of certain disposition opportunities because of additional costs we have agreed to pay if we sell the university towers collegiate housing community in a taxable transaction 
we issued university towers partnership units for our interest in university towers 
so long as the contributing owners of such property hold at least of the university towers partnership units  we have agreed to maintain certain minimum amounts of debt on the property so as to avoid triggering gain to the contributing owners 
if we fail to do this  we will owe to the contributing owners the amount of taxes that they incur 
in each case  the amount of tax is computed assuming the highest federal and state rates 
as a result  these agreements may preclude us from selling the restricted property at the optimal time 
our growth will be dependent upon our ability to acquire and or develop  lease  integrate and manage additional collegiate housing communities successfully 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify real estate investments  including joint ventures  that meet our investment criteria  that we will be successful in completing any acquisition we identify or that any acquisition we complete will produce a return on our investment 

table of contents our future growth will be dependent upon our ability to successfully acquire new properties and enter into joint ventures on favorable terms  which may be adversely affected by the following significant risks we may be unable to acquire a desired property at all or at a desired purchase price because of competition from other purchasers of collegiate housing  many of our future acquisitions are likely to be dependent on external financing  and we may be unable to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all  we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to improve or renovate acquired properties  we may incur an increase in operating costs or may not have the proceeds available to implement renovations or improvements at existing properties which are necessary to attract and retain tenants  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into our existing operations  market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates  and we may acquire properties subject to liabilities but without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  to the sellers  or with liabilities that are unknown to us  such as liabilities for undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by members  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
as we acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including lease up and integration risks 
newly acquired properties may not perform as expected  and newly acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us at the time of acquisition 
we may be unable to invest our capital resources on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to achieve our expected levels of financial performance will depend significantly upon our ability to invest efficiently our available capital resources in accretive transactions 
although we seek to maintain a pipeline of suitable investment opportunities  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify any acquisition and or development opportunities or other investments that meet our investment objectives or that any investment that we make will produce a positive return 
moreover  our investment pipeline is generally subject to numerous uncertainties and conditions that make it difficult to predict if or when any such potential transactions will be consummated 
accordingly  we may be unable to invest our available capital resources on acceptable terms within the time period that we anticipate  or at all  and these delays could result in additional dilution and may cause our financial results  including funds from operations  or ffo  per share  to fall short of analyst expectations 
moreover  we have significant flexibility in investing our capital resources  and we may use the resources in ways with which our stockholders may not agree or for purposes other than those that we originally contemplated 
our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 
we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located or under development  and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases 
as the lessee under a ground lease  we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property or building we may be developing upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 
we have limited time to perform due diligence on many of our acquired properties  which could subject us to significant unexpected liabilities and under performance of the acquired properties 
when we enter into an agreement to acquire a property  we often have limited time to complete our due diligence prior to acquiring the property 
because our internal resources are limited  we may rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our due diligence 
to the extent these third parties or we underestimate or fail to identify risks and liabilities associated with the properties we acquire  we may incur unexpected liabilities  or the property may fail to perform in accordance with our projections 
if  during the due diligence phase  we do not accurately assess the value of and liabilities associated with a particular property  we may pay a purchase price that exceeds the current fair value of the assets 
as a result  material goodwill and other intangible assets would be recorded  which could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods 
these charges  in addition to the financial impact of significant liabilities that we may assume  could materially and adversely impact our financial and operating results  as well as our ability to pay distributions 

table of contents certain losses may not be covered by insurance or may be underinsured 
we carry insurance covering comprehensive liability  fire  earthquake  terrorism  business interruption  vandalism and malicious mischief  extended coverage perils  physical loss perils  commercial general liability  personal injury  workers compensation  business  automobile  errors and omissions  employee dishonesty  employment practices liability and rental loss with respect to all of the properties in our portfolio and the operation of our management company and development company 
we also carry insurance covering flood when the property is located in whole or in material part in a designated flood plain area on some of our properties 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss  the cost of the coverage and industry practice 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as property damage from riots or wars  employment discrimination losses  punitive damage awards  or acts of god that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
some of our policies are subject to large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses 
in addition  we may discontinue earthquake  terrorism or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for these policies exceeds  in our judgment  the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss 
if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters 
under various environmental laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for contamination resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum at that property  and an entity that arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum at another property may be held jointly and severally liable for the cost to investigate and clean up such property or other affected property 
such parties are known as potentially responsible parties  or prps 
environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contaminants  and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances can be substantial 
prps are liable to the government as well as to other prps who may have claims for contribution 
the liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party 
the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third party liability for personal injury or property damage  or adversely affect our ability to sell  lease or develop the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral 
we do not carry environmental insurance on any of the properties in our portfolio 
environmental laws also impose ongoing compliance requirements on owners and operators of real property 
environmental laws potentially affecting us address a wide variety of matters  including  but not limited to  asbestos containing building materials  storage tanks  storm water and wastewater discharges  lead based paint  wetlands and hazardous wastes 
failure to comply with these laws could result in fines and penalties and or expose us to third party liability 
some of our properties may have conditions that are subject to these requirements  and we could be liable for such fines or penalties and or liable to third parties for those conditions 
we could be exposed to liability and remedial costs related to environmental matters 
certain properties in our portfolio may contain  or may have contained  asbestos containing building materials  or acbms 
environmental laws require that acbms be properly managed and maintained  and may impose fines and penalties on building owners and operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
also  certain properties may contain  or may have contained  or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
certain properties in our portfolio contain  or may have contained  elevated radon levels 
third parties may be permitted by law to seek recovery from owners or operators for property damage and or personal injury associated with exposure to contaminants  including  but not limited to  petroleum products  hazardous or toxic substances and asbestos fibers 
also  some of the properties may contain regulated wetlands that can delay or impede development or require costs to be incurred to mitigate the impact of any disturbance 
absent appropriate permits  we can be held responsible for restoring wetlands and be required to pay fines and penalties 

table of contents some of the properties in our portfolio may contain microbial matter such as mold and mildew 
in addition  if any property in our portfolio is not properly connected to a water or sewer system  or if the integrity of such systems are breached  or if water intrusion into our buildings otherwise occurs  microbial matter or other contamination can develop 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
if this were to occur  we could incur significant remedial costs and we may also be subject to material private damage claims and awards 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing  as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
if we become subject to claims in this regard  it could materially and adversely affect us and our future insurability for such matters 
independent environmental consultants conduct phase i environmental site assessments on all of our acquisitions 
phase i environmental site assessments are intended to evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties based generally on visual observations  interviews and certain publicly available databases 
these assessments do not typically take into account all environmental issues including  but not limited to  testing of soil or groundwater or the possible presence of asbestos  lead based paint  radon  wetlands or mold 
the results of these assessments are addressed and could result in either a cancellation of the purchase  the requirement of the seller to remediate issues or additional costs on our part to remediate the issue 
none of the previous site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would be material to us 
however  the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns 
material environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the assessments were conducted or may arise in the future  and future laws  ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability 
we cannot assure you that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to make distributions or that such costs or other remedial measures will not be material to us 
we may incur significant costs complying with the americans with disabilities act and similar laws 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or the ada  all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
additional federal  state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties  or restrict our ability to renovate our properties 
for example  the fair housing amendments act of  or fhaa  requires apartment properties first occupied after march  to be accessible to the handicapped 
we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with present ada requirements 
noncompliance with the ada or fhaa could result in the imposition of fines or an award for damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non complying feature 
we cannot predict the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the ada  fhaa or other legislation 
if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada  fhaa or any other legislation  we could be materially and adversely affected 
reporting of on campus crime statistics required of universities may negatively impact our communities 
federal and state laws require universities to publish and distribute reports of on campus crime statistics  which may result in negative publicity and media coverage associated with crimes occurring in the vicinity of  or on the premises of  our on campus communities 
reports of crime or other negative publicity regarding the safety of the students residing on  or near  our communities may have an adverse effect on both our on campus and off campus communities 
joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on co venturers financial condition and disputes between our co venturers and us 
we have co invested and anticipate that we will continue to co invest with third parties through partnerships  joint ventures or other entities  acquiring noncontrolling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
in such event  we do not have sole decision making authority regarding the property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
investments in partnerships  joint ventures or other entities may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not present were a third party not involved  including the possibility that partners or co venturers may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions 
partners or co venturers also may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our preferences  policies or objectives 
such investments also will have the potential risk of our reaching impasses with our partners or co venturers on key decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor the partner or co venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture 
disputes between us and our partners or co venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our management team from focusing its time and effort exclusively 
table of contents on our business 
in addition  we may in some circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party partners or co venturers 
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions is limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors  such as general economic conditions  availability of financing  interest rates and other factors  including supply and demand  that are beyond our control 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold 
we cannot ensure that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements 
in acquiring a property  we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions  such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property 
these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 
risks associated with our indebtedness and financing we depend heavily on the availability of debt and equity capital to fund our business 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we are required under the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  to distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than of our net taxable income  including any net capital gains  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws 
because of these distribution requirements  reits are largely unable to fund capital expenditures  such as acquisitions  renovations  development and property upgrades from operating cash flow 
consequently  we will be largely dependent on the public equity and debt capital markets and private lenders to provide capital to fund our growth and other capital expenditures 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or at all 
our access to equity and debt capital depends  in part  on general market conditions  our current debt levels and the number of properties subject to encumbrances  our current performance and the market s perception of our growth potential  our cash flow and cash distributions  and the market price per share of our common stock 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our debt service obligations or make cash distributions to our stockholders  including those necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
current market conditions could affect our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and may have other adverse effects on us 
the united states credit markets have in the recent past experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions  including the bankruptcy  insolvency or restructuring of certain financial institutions 
in addition  recent us budget deficit concerns  together with signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in europe  have increased the possibility of additional credit rating downgrades and economic slowdowns 
these circumstances have impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms for certain borrowers less attractive  and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
although we believe that our master secured credit facility and fourth amended revolver each defined below are sufficient for our current operations  any reductions in our available borrowing capacity  or our inability to renew or replace these facilities when required or when business conditions warrant  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase 
higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact us as well 
if interest rates increase  our interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase  which could adversely affect our transaction and development activity  financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the market price of our stock  our ability to pay principal and interest on 
table of contents our debt and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
if we are unable to secure additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow is insufficient  we may not be able to satisfy our outstanding financial obligations under our mortgage and construction debt 
furthermore  if financing is not available when needed  or is available on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing 
such sources may not then be available and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly or significantly cutback or curtail operations and development plans 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 
in addition  we mortgage some of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness 
in  million  or  of our mortgage and construction debt reaches maturity 
if we are unable to service the debt  including in the event we are not successful in refinancing our debt upon maturity  then the properties securing the mortgages could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee  or we might be forced to dispose of some of our properties on disadvantageous terms  with a consequent loss of income and asset value 
a foreclosure of a mortgaged property could also cause cross defaults under the master secured credit facility 
a foreclosure or disadvantageous disposal on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  our stock 
our use of debt financing reduces cash available for distribution and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 
our charter and bylaws impose no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 
our debt service obligations expose us to the risk of default and reduce or eliminate cash resources that are available to operate our business 
the fourth amended revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and provides for potential availability of million upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
the amount available to us and our ability to borrow from time to time under this facility is subject to certain conditions which includes borrowing base calculations that limit availability based upon the underlying value of the property asset value as defined in the agreement and the satisfaction of specified financial and other covenants  which include  without limitation  limiting distributions to our stockholders 
if the income generated by our properties and other assets fails to cover our debt service  we would be forced to reduce or eliminate distributions to our stockholders and may experience losses 
our level of debt and the operating limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences  including the following we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms  we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness  we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties  possibly on disadvantageous terms  we may default on our payment or other obligations as a result of insufficient cash flow or otherwise  and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases  a default under the master secured credit facility or the fourth amended revolver may preclude further availability of credit from other sources  and foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  a circumstance that could hinder our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements 
a change in us government policy with regard to fannie mae could materially impact our financial condition 
in the u 
s 
treasury removed the billion cap on the amount of financial aid available for fannie mae and extended its conservatorship of fannie mae through the treasury also capped fannie mae s retained mortgage portfolio limitation at billion and required that this portfolio be reduced on a phased basis beginning in through expansion of its off balance sheet lending products  we believe that fannie mae s balance sheet limitations will not restrict its support of lending to the collegiate housing industry and to us in particular 
should loan availability be reduced  it could impact the value of collegiate housing assets and impair the value of our properties  and we would seek alternative sources of funding 
we anticipate that additional capital may be available only at a higher cost and have less attractive terms  if available at all 

table of contents a change in the value of our assets could cause us to experience a cash shortfall  be in default of our loan covenants  lose management control or incur a charge for the impairment of assets 
we borrow on a secured basis under the master secured credit facility 
a significant reduction in value of the assets secured as collateral could require us to post additional collateral or pay down the balance of the facility 
while we believe that we have significant excess collateral and capacity  future asset values are uncertain 
if we were unable to meet a request to add collateral to the facility  this inability would have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and our ability to comply with our loan covenants 
we may determine that the value of an individual asset  or group of assets  was irrevocably impaired  and that we need to record a charge to write down the value of the asset to reflect its current estimated value based on its intended use 
our collegiate housing communities have previously been  and in the future may be  subject to impairment charges  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are required to periodically evaluate our properties for impairment indicators 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property  based on its intended use  is less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates of cash flows are based on factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of interest and capitalization rates  demand and occupancy  competition and other factors 
ongoing adverse market and economic conditions and market volatility make it difficult to value our collegiate housing communities 
these factors may result in uncertainty in valuation estimates and instability in the estimated value of our collegiate housing communities which  in turn  could result in a substantial decrease in the value of the communities and significant impairment charges 
we continually assess our collegiate housing communities to determine if any dispositions are necessary or appropriate 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of our collegiate housing communities in the future 
our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion  which could materially and adversely affect us and our results of operations 
variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
we have mortgage and construction debt with varying interest rates dependent upon london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin 
in addition  our third amended revolver bore  and our fourth amended revolver bears  interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn under the facility 
as of december   we had a total of million outstanding in variable rate debt  or approximately  of our total debt 
we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future 
increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense  unless we make arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates  which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to stockholders 
we may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements 
periodically  we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with changes in interest rates  and we may continue to do so in the future 
although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates  they may also reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline 
if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness which is hedged  we may be exposed to losses to the extent which the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other 
additionally  nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks 
broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
as with other publicly traded equity securities  the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions  which may change from time to time 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that are outside of management s control 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely impact the market price of our common stock 
accordingly  the market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business  our industry or our operating performance and financial condition 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects may not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors or may not be comparable to companies within our industry and with comparable market capitalizations 
any of these factors could lead to a material decline in the market price of our common stock 

table of contents additional issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to stockholders 
the interests of our stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities to finance future developments or acquisitions or to repay indebtedness 
our board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional equity securities without stockholder approval 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends upon our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including revolving credit facilities and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including the issuance of common equity 
we may reduce the amount of dividends declared on our common stock 
in order for edr to continue to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute annual dividends generally equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
however  in the event of material deterioration in business conditions or tightening in the credit markets  among other factors  our board of directors may decide to reduce the amount of our dividend while ensuring compliance with the requirements of the code related to reit qualification 
risks related to our organization and structure to maintain our reit status  we may be forced to limit the activities of our management company and development company 
to maintain our status as a reit  no more than of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries  such as our management company and our development company 
some of our activities  such as our third party management  development consulting and food services  must be conducted through our management company and development company for us to maintain our reit qualification 
in addition  certain non customary services such as cleaning  transportation  security and  in some cases  parking  must be provided by one of our taxable reit subsidiaries or an independent contractor 
if the revenues from such activities create a risk that the value of our management company and other trss  based on revenues or otherwise  approaches the threshold  we will be forced to curtail such activities or take other steps to remain under the threshold 
because the threshold is based on value  it is possible that the internal revenue service  or irs  could successfully contend that the value of our management company and other trss exceed the threshold even if our management company and other trss accounts for less than of our consolidated revenues  income or cash flow  in which case our status as a reit could be jeopardized 
our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock 
our charter provides that  subject to certain exceptions  no person or entity may beneficially own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the code  more than by value  by number of shares or by voting power  whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than by value  by number of shares or by voting power  whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our capital stock  including both common and preferred stock 
we refer to these restrictions collectively as the ownership limit 
generally  if a beneficial owner of our shares exceeds the ownership limit  such owner will be effectively divested of all ownership rights with respect to shares exceeding the limit and may suffer a loss on such investment 
the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than of our stock or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns  actually or constructively  our stock by an individual or entity  could  nevertheless cause that individual or entity  or another individual or entity  to own constructively in excess of of our outstanding common stock and thereby subject certain shares to the ramifications of exceeding the ownership limit 
our charter  however  permits exceptions to be made to this limitation if our board of directors determines that such exceptions will not jeopardize our tax status as a reit 
this ownership limit could delay  defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction that might otherwise result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 

table of contents certain ownership limitations and anti takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 
certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us  or could delay  defer or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management 
these provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include the reit ownership limit described above  authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers  preferences or rights to be determined by our board of directors  the right of our board of directors  without a stockholder vote  to increase our authorized shares and classify or reclassify unissued shares  and advance notice requirements for stockholder nomination of directors and for other proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings 
the maryland business statutes also impose potential restrictions on a change of control of edr 
various maryland laws may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us  even if the acquisition would be advantageous to our stockholders 
our bylaws exempt us from some of those laws  such as the control share acquisition provisions  but our board of directors can change our bylaws at any time to make these provisions applicable to us 
we have the right to change some of our policies that may be important to our stockholders without stockholder consent 
our major policies  including our policies with respect to investments  leverage  financing  growth  debt and capitalization  are determined by our board of directors or those committees or officers to whom our board of directors has delegated that authority 
our board of directors also establishes the amount of any distributions that we make to our stockholders 
our board of directors may amend or revise the foregoing policies  our distribution payment amounts and other policies from time to time without a stockholder vote 
accordingly  our stockholders may not have control over changes in our policies 
the ability of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 
our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election  without the approval of our stockholders  if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit 
if we cease to qualify as a reit  we would become subject to federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders  which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 
our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 
maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith  in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be advisable and in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances 
in addition  our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money  property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and that is material to the cause of action 
our bylaws require us to indemnify directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacitates to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law 
as a result  our stockholders and we may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 
in addition  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 

table of contents our success depends upon key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
we depend upon the services of our key personnel  particularly randy churchey  president and chief executive officer  randall h 
brown  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  thomas trubiana  our executive vice president and chief investment officer  and christine richards  our senior vice president and chief operating officer 
mr 
churchey s considerable experience as a senior executive officer of publicly traded real estate companies  including reits  prior service to edr as a member of the board of directors and familiarity with our operational and organizational structure are critical to the oversight and implementation of our strategic initiatives and the evaluation of our operational performance 
in addition  mr 
brown possesses detailed knowledge of and experience with our financial and ancillary support operations that are critical to our operations and financial reporting obligations as a public company 
mr 
trubiana has been in the collegiate housing business for over years  and has developed a network of contacts and a reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with universities  lenders and industry personnel 
ms 
richards possesses detailed knowledge of our property operations that is critical to the oversight of our communities performance and has considerable experience in the collegiate housing industry 
we will continue to need to attract and retain qualified additional senior executive officers as we grow our business 
the loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers  or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
any weaknesses identified in our system of internal controls by us and our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have an adverse effect on our business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that public companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must report on management s evaluation of those controls 
in future periods  we may identify deficiencies in our system of internal controls over financial reporting that may require remediation 
there can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified may not be material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods 
federal income tax risks failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 
we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit under the code 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we qualify as a reit 
if we lose our reit status  we will face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders for each year that we fail to qualify as a reit because we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and  therefore  such amounts would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  and unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders 
as a result of all these factors  our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that  like us  holds its assets through partnerships and limited liability companies 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
in order to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy a number of requirements  including requirements regarding the diversification of our assets and the sources of our gross income composition of our assets and two gross income tests 
to satisfy the sources of gross income requirements  we must derive a at least of our gross income in any year from qualified sources  such as rents from real property  mortgage interest  distributions from other reits and gains from sale of such assets  and b at least of our gross income from sources meeting the gross income test above  and other passive investment sources  such as other interest and dividends and gains from sales of securities 
also  we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains 
in order to meet these requirements  we may be required to forgo investments we might otherwise make 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our performance 
in addition  new legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our 
table of contents investors  our ability to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 
we may be subject to federal and state income taxes that would harm our financial condition 
even if we maintain our status as a reit  we may become subject to federal and state income taxes 
for example  if we recognize a gain from a sale of dealer property or inventory or if our management company enters into agreements with us or our tenants on a basis that is determined to be other than an arm s length  that gain or income will be subject to a penalty tax 
if we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction  we will attempt to structure a sale through a taxable reit subsidiary  in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the prohibited transaction tax 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs would not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly  rather than through a taxable reit subsidiary  were sales of dealer property or inventory  in which case the penalty tax will apply 
in addition  we may not be able to make sufficient distributions to avoid corporate income tax and or the excise tax on undistributded income 
we may also be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property  either directly or at the level of our operating partnership or the university towers partnership or at a level of the other entities through which we indirectly own our properties that would aversely affect our operating results 
an investment in our common stock has various tax risks  including the treatment of distributions in excess of earnings and the inability to apply passive losses against distributions 
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits  to the extent that they exceed the adjusted basis of an investor s common stock  will be treated as long term capital gain or short term capital gain if the shares have been held for less than one year 
any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares by a stockholder who is not a dealer in securities will be treated as a long term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year and otherwise will be treated as short term capital gain or loss 
distributions that we properly designate as capital gain distributions to the extent that they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year will be treated as taxable to stockholders as gains from the sale or disposition of a capital asset held for greater than one year 
distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a stockholder of shares of our stock will not be treated as passive income  meaning stockholders generally will not be able to apply any passive losses against such income or gain 
future distributions may include a significant portion as a return of capital 
our distributions have historically exceeded  and may continue to exceed  the amount of our net income as a reit 
any distributions in excess of a stockholder s share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s basis in our stock  and the stockholder s basis in our stock will be reduced by such amount 
to the extent distributions exceed both the stockholder s share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder s basis in our stock  the stockholder will recognize capital gain  assuming the stock is held as a capital asset 
if distributions by us result in a reduction of a stockholder s adjusted basis in its stock  subsequent sales by such stockholder of its stock potentially will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or reduced capital loss due to the reduction in such stockholder s adjusted basis in its stock 
the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes 
a reit s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a penalty tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property  other than foreclosure property held in inventory primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as inventory held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business  subject to certain statutory safe harbors  such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors 
if our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  its income may be subject to corporate level income taxation 
we intend for our operating partnership to maintain its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  however  if the irs were to successfully challenge the status of our operating partnership as a partnership  our operating partnership would be taxable as a corporation 
in such event  this would reduce the amount of distributions that our operating partnership could make to us 
this could also result in our losing reit status and becoming subject to a corporate level income tax 
this would substantially reduce our cash available to pay distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  if any of the entities through which 
table of contents our operating partnership owns its properties  in whole or in part  loses its characterization as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  it would be subject to taxation as a corporation  thereby reducing distributions to our operating partnership 
such a re characterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain reit status

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
in october  nareit communicated to its members that the exclusion of impairment write downs of depreciable real estate is consistent with the definition of ffo and prior periods should be restated to be consistent with this guidance 
accordingly  we have restated all periods presented to reflect the current guidance 
we present ffo available to all stockholders and unitholders because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
as such  we also exclude the impact of noncontrolling interest in our calculation 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
for a reconciliation of our ffo available to our stockholders and unitholders to our net income loss for the years ended december   and  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funds from operations 
core ffo is defined as ffo adjusted to include the economic impact of revenue on participating projects for which recognition is deferred for gaap purposes 
the adjustment for this revenue is calculated on the same percentage of completion method used to recognize revenue on third party development projects 
core ffo also includes adjustments to exclude the impact of straight line adjustments for ground leases  gains losses on extinguishment of debt  transaction costs related to acquisitions and reorganization or severance costs 
we believe that these adjustments are appropriate in determining core ffo as they are not indicative of the operating performance of the trust s assets 
in addition  management uses core ffo in the assessment of the trust s operating performance and comparison to its industry peers and believes that core ffo is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing the trust to other reits as many reits provide some form of adjusted or modified ffo

overview we are a self managed and self advised reit engaged in the ownership  acquisition  development and management of high quality collegiate housing communities 
we also provide collegiate housing management and development consulting services to universities  charitable foundations and other third parties 
we believe that we are one of the largest private owners  developers and managers of high quality collegiate housing communities in the united states in terms of total beds both owned and under management 
we earn income from rental payments we receive as a result of our ownership of collegiate housing communities 
we also earn income by performing property management services and development consulting services for third parties through our management company and our development company  respectively 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our business segments we define business segments by their distinct customer base and the service provided 
management has identified three reportable segments collegiate housing leasing  development consulting services and management services 
we evaluate each segment s performance based on net operating income  which is defined as income before depreciation  amortization  ground leases  impairment losses  interest expense income  gains losses on extinguishment of debt  equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities  noncontrolling interests and discontinued operations 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are described in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
collegiate housing leasing collegiate housing leasing revenue represented approximately of our revenue  excluding operating expense reimbursements  for the year ended december  
table of contents unlike multi family housing where apartments are leased by the unit  collegiate housing communities are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis 
individual lease liability limits each resident s liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate s rent 
the number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore equivalent to the number of beds occupied instead of the number of apartment units occupied 
a parent or guardian is required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income and or pays a deposit  which is usually equal to two months rent 
due to our predominantly private bedroom accommodations and individual lease liability  the high level of student oriented amenities and the fact that most units are furnished and typically rent includes utilities  cable television and internet service  we believe our communities in most cases can command higher per unit and per square foot rental rates than most multi family communities in the same geographic markets 
we are also typically able to command higher rental rates than on campus collegiate housing  which tends to offer fewer amenities 
the majority of our leases commence mid august and terminate the last day of july 
these dates generally coincide with the commencement of the universities fall academic term and the completion of the subsequent summer school session 
as such  we are required to re lease each community in its entirety each year  resulting in significant turnover in our tenant population from year to year 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of our leased beds were to students who were first time residents at our communities 
as a result  we are highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season that typically begins in november and ends in august of each year 
our communities occupancy rates are therefore typically stable during the august to july academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year 
prior to the commencement of each new lease period  mostly during the first two weeks of august  but also during september at some communities  we prepare the units for new incoming tenants 
other than revenue generated by in place leases for returning tenants  we do not generally recognize lease revenue during this period referred to as turn  as we have no leases in place 
in addition  we incur significant expenses during turn to make our units ready for occupancy 
these expenses are recognized when incurred 
this turn period results in seasonality in our operating results during the third quarter of each year 
development consulting services for the year ended december   revenue from our development consulting services represented approximately of our revenue  excluding operating expense reimbursements 
we provide development consulting services primarily to colleges and universities seeking to modernize their on campus collegiate housing communities  to other third party investors and to our collegiate housing leasing segment in order to develop communities for our ownership 
our development consulting services typically include the following market analysis and evaluation of collegiate housing needs and options  cooperation with college or university in architectural design  negotiation of ground lease  development agreement  construction contract  architectural contract and bond documents  oversight of architectural design process  coordination of governmental and university plan approvals  oversight of construction process  design  purchase and installation of furniture  pre opening marketing to students  and obtaining final approvals of construction 
fees for these services are typically of the total cost of a project and are payable over the life of the construction period  which in most cases is one to two years in length 
occasionally  the development consulting contracts include a provision whereby the trust can participate in project savings resulting from successful cost management efforts 
these revenues are recognized once all contractual terms have been satisfied and no future performance requirements exist 
this typically occurs after construction is complete 
as part of the development agreements  there are certain costs we pay on behalf of universities or third party investors 
these costs are included in reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the universities or third party investors 
we recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred 

table of contents these operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by management when analyzing the operating performance of our development consulting services business 
management services for the year ended december   revenue from our management services segment represented approximately of our revenue  excluding operating expense reimbursements 
we provide management services for collegiate housing communities owned by educational institutions  charitable foundations  the trust and others 
our management services typically cover all aspects of community operations  including residence life and student development  marketing  leasing administration  strategic relationships  information systems and accounting services 
we provide these services pursuant to multi year management agreements under which management fees are typically of leasing revenue 
these agreements usually have an initial term of two to five years with renewal options of like terms 
as part of the management agreements  there are certain payroll and related expenses we pay on behalf of the property owners 
these costs are included in reimbursable operating expenses and are required to be reimbursed to us by the property owners 
we recognize the expense and revenue related to these reimbursements when incurred 
these operating expenses are wholly reimbursable and therefore not considered by management when analyzing the operating performance of our management services business 
trends and outlook rents and occupancy we manage our communities to maximize revenues  which are primarily driven by two components rental rates and occupancy rate 
we customarily adjust rental rates in order to maximize revenues  which in some cases results in a lower occupancy rate  but in most cases results in stable or increasing revenue from the community 
as a result  a decrease in occupancy may be offset by an increase in rental rates and may not be material to our operations 
periodically  certain of our markets experience increases in new on campus collegiate housing provided by colleges and universities and off campus collegiate housing provided by private owners 
this additional collegiate housing both on and off campus can create competitive pressure on rental rates and occupancy 
our communities occupancy rates are typically stable during the august to july academic year but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year 
for the year ended december   same community revenue per available bed increased to and same community physical occupancy decreased to  compared to same community revenue per available bed of and same community physical occupancy of for the year ended december  the results represent averages for the trust s portfolio  which are not necessarily indicative of every community in the portfolio 
individual communities can and do perform both above and below these averages  and  at times  an individual community may experience a decline in total revenue due to local university and economic conditions 
our management focus is to assess these situations and address them quickly in an effort to minimize the trust s exposure and reverse any negative trends 
our last two leasing cycles produced same community revenue growth of nearly in and over in same community opening occupancy for the lease term was as compared to for the lease term 
net rental rates for the lease term increased approximately over the prior lease term  thus producing overall same community revenue growth of approximately over the prior lease term 
the decline in occupancy for the lease term is primarily attributable to communities that were impacted by local factors  including modest declines in university enrollment 
development consulting services the trust has historically earned more than million annually in third party development revenue 
however  as a result of a deterioration in the credit markets  which began in late  financing of new projects became harder to obtain  and the trust s third party development revenue declined from million for the year ended december  to million in and then rebounded to million in for the year ended december   third party development revenue was million 
beginning in the summer of  our development team began seeing improvement in the credit markets and an increase in interest from colleges and universities that are considering new collegiate housing 
we also continue to receive requests for proposals on new development projects 
this improvement in the development consulting market is evidenced by the trust s active development projects  the completion of our participating development during the second quarter of and the completion of two third party developments in the first quarter of furthermore  the trust currently has one active third party development at mansfield university of pennsylvania scheduled to open in summer  three third party 
table of contents developments scheduled to begin in the spring summer of at clarion university of pennsylvania  east stroudsburg university of pennsylvania and west chester university of pennsylvania and was awarded a third party development at wichita state university in the fourth quarter of that is also scheduled to begin in we develop collegiate housing communities for our ownership  and we plan to increase self development activity going forward 
the on campus equity plan  or the one plan sm  is our private equity program for universities  which allows universities to use the trust s equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their credit capacity for other campus projects 
this program is designed to provide the trust s equity to solve a university s housing needs through a ground lease structure where the trust owns the land improvements and operates the community 
others in the industry have a similar program and to date the trust has four one plan sm projects completed or underway 
in december  we were selected by the university of kentucky uk to develop  own and manage a multi phase project aimed at revitalizing uk s on campus housing which could potentially include the addition of  beds within five to seven years utilizing the one plan sm 
construction on central hall  the first building in the multi phase project  is progressing as planned 
the bed  two building  four story community will be available for occupancy in the summer of in october  the trust received approval from the uk board of trustees and signed definitive agreements for phase ii of the project 
phase ii of the project will include four communities with  beds and a total project cost of approximately million 
all four communities are expected to open in the summer of we view our entry into the partnership with uk as a defining moment  not only for edr  but also for our industry 
most state universities face many of the same challenges as uk  including reduced support from constrained state budgets  aged on campus housing and demands on institutional funds for academic and support services 
this declining state support for higher education is the norm rather than the exception 
these external factors provide a great opportunity for our company 
the volume of discussions we are having with other universities has increased over the last year as additional universities investigate this type of structure to replace their aging on campus housing stock 
we expect the volume of true third party development contracts to be impacted as more universities avail themselves of this new program 
while considering the possible shift in the type of projects universities pursue  the amount and timing of future revenue from development consulting services will be contingent upon our ability to successfully compete in public colleges and universities competitive procurement processes  our ability to successfully structure financing of these projects and our ability to ensure completion of construction within committed timelines and budgets 
to date  we have completed construction on all of our development consulting projects in time for their targeted occupancy dates 
collegiate housing operating costs the trust implemented focused cost control measures in late that drove a same community operating expense decline of for the year ended december  and helped keep operating expenses relatively flat during during the year ended december   same community operating expenses increased approximately compared to the year ended december   which included a increase in direct operating expenses and a increase in fixed costs primarily as a result of real estate tax refunds received in for the year ended december   same community operating expenses increased approximately compared to the same period in the prior year which is in line with our expectation and a reasonable level of growth for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative costs historically  we have presented all general and administrative g a costs  including regional and corporate costs of supporting our communities  in g a in our consolidated statement of operations 
beginning with the three months ended march   we began reporting the costs to manage our owned portfolio as part of our collegiate housing operating costs and not as part of g a costs  and previous periods presented have been reclassified for consistent presentation and comparability see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the new presentation improves comparability within the industry and provides a better reflection of the total cost to operate a property as we do not include management fees in our property operating expenses 
g a costs for the year ended december  were million  before development pursuit costs and acquisition costs  an increase of million  or  when compared to the same period in the prior year 
this increase is largely due to costs associated with the growth of our owned collegiate housing portfolio  the growth in our owned development activity and normal inflationary pressures

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
collegiate housing leasing revenue recognition collegiate housing leasing revenue is comprised of all revenues related to the leasing activities at our collegiate housing communities and includes revenues from leasing apartments by the bed  food services  parking space rentals and certain ancillary services 
students are required to execute lease contracts with payment schedules that vary from per semester to monthly 
generally  a parental guarantee must accompany each executed contract 
receivables are recorded when due  while leasing revenue and related lease incentives concessions and nonrefundable application and service fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contracts 
balances are considered past due when payment is not received on the contractual due date 
allowances for doubtful accounts are established by management when it is determined that collection is doubtful 
revenue and cost recognition of development consulting services costs associated with the pursuit of third party development consulting contracts are expensed as incurred until such time as we have been notified of a contract award or reimbursement that has been otherwise guaranteed by the customer 
at such time  the reimbursable portion of such costs is recorded as a receivable 
development consulting revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method as determined by construction costs incurred relative to the total estimated construction costs 
occasionally  our development consulting contracts include a provision whereby we can participate in project savings resulting from our successful cost management efforts 
we recognize these revenues once all contractual terms have been satisfied and we have no future performance requirements 
this typically occurs after construction is complete 
costs associated with development consulting services are expensed as incurred 
we generally receive a significant percentage of our fees for development consulting services upon closing of the project financing  a portion of the fee over the construction period and the balance upon substantial completion of construction 
because revenue from these services is recognized for financial reporting purposes utilizing the percentage of completion method  differences occur between amounts received and revenues recognized 
differences also occur between amounts recognized for tax purposes and those recognized for financial reporting purposes 
we also periodically enter into joint venture arrangements whereby we provide development consulting services to third party collegiate housing owners in an agency capacity 
we recognize our portion of the earnings in each joint venture based on our ownership interest  which is reflected after net operating income in our condensed consolidated statement of operations as equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
our revenue and operating expenses could fluctuate from period to period based on the extent to which we utilize joint venture arrangements to provide third party development consulting services 
collegiate housing property acquisitions and dispositions land  land improvements  buildings and improvements and furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  land improvements are depreciated over years and furniture  fixtures  and equipment are depreciated over to years 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes 
results of operations for acquired collegiate housing communities are included in the trust s results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
appraisals  estimates of cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land  land improvements  buildings and improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangibles such as amounts related to in place leases 
the trust recognizes pre acquisition costs  which include legal and professional fees and other third party costs related directly to the acquisition of a community when 
table of contents they are incurred 
management assesses impairment of long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
management uses an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset based on its intended use to determine whether the carrying value is recoverable 
if the trust determines that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  the fair value of the asset is estimated and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management estimates fair value using discounted cash flow models  market appraisals if available  and other market participant data 
when a collegiate housing community has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale  the fair value less cost to sell such asset is estimated 
if fair value less cost to sell the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment charge is recorded for the estimated loss 
depreciation expense is no longer recorded once a collegiate housing community has met the held for sale criteria 
the related carrying value of the community is recorded as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and operations of collegiate housing communities that are sold or classified as held for sale are recorded as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented 
repairs and maintenance the costs of ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations when incurred 
major improvements that extend the life of an asset beyond one year are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
planned major repair  maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed 
in some circumstances  the lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures 
these amounts are not available for current use and are recorded as restricted cash on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
use of estimates significant estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the recognition of third party development consulting revenue under the percentage of completion method  useful lives of collegiate housing assets  the valuation of goodwill  the initial valuations and underlying allocations of purchase price in connection with collegiate housing property acquisitions  the determination of fair value for impairment assessments and in recording the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we review our assets  including our collegiate housing communities  communities under development and goodwill for potential impairment indicators whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  declines in our market capitalization  overall market factors  changes in cash flows  significant decreases in net operating income and occupancies at our operating properties  changes in projected completion dates of our development projects and sustainability of development projects 
our tests for impairment are based on the most current information available and if conditions change or if our plans regarding our assets change  it could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
however  based on our plans with respect to our operating properties and those under development  we believe the carrying amounts are recoverable

we believe that these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our short term capital needs 
distributions for the year ended december  totaled million  or  per weighted average share unit  compared to cash provided by operations of million  or  per weighted average share unit 
based on our closing share price of on december   our total enterprise value was billion 
with net debt total debt less cash of million as of december   our debt to enterprise value was compared to as of december  with gross assets of billion  which excludes accumulated depreciation of million  our debt to gross assets ratio was as of december  as compared to as of december  management believes that it has strengthened the trust s balance sheet through the follow on equity offerings in august of and january and november of  selling million shares  million shares and million shares  respectively  all including the underwriters overallotment option to purchase additional shares  for net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively 
a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay approximately million of debt with the remaining proceeds used to fund the trust s current developments and acquisitions  fund future acquisitions and developments and for general corporate purposes 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we implemented an at the market equity distribution program during the second quarter of as of december   the trust had sold million shares of common stock under the agreements for net proceeds of million and reached the aggregate offering amount of million 
on september   the trust entered into the equity distribution agreement 
similar to the equity distribution agreements  the trust may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering amount of up to million 
as of december   the trust had sold million shares of common stock under the equity distribution program for net proceeds of approximately million and reached the aggregate offering amount of million 
the trust used the net proceeds to repay debt  fund its development pipeline  fund potential future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
on may   the trust entered into two additional equity distribution agreements similar to the previous agreements discussed above 
under the agreements the trust may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering amount of million 
as of december   the trust had sold million shares of common stock under the agreements for net proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents an additional source of capital  subject to appropriate market conditions  is the targeted disposition of non strategic properties 
we continually assess all of our communities  the markets in which they are located and the colleges and universities they serve  to determine if any dispositions are necessary or appropriate 
the net proceeds from the sale of any asset would provide additional capital that would most likely be used to pay down debt and possibly finance acquisition development growth or other operational needs 
the trust completed the sale of five communities in january see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these transactions culminated a significant repositioning of the trust s portfolio that began in the fourth quarter of the five communities had over  beds and were at mostly smaller universities with limited barriers to entry 
with a total sales price of approximately million  the dispositions reduced outstanding debt by million and provided net cash proceeds  after costs  of approximately million 
in the second quarter of  we completed the sale of two non core assets  collegiate village  serving macon state university  and clayton station  serving clayton state university  for an aggregate sale price of million see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to fund development and acquisition activity and for general working capital purposes 
in the third quarter of  we completed the sale of northpointe  located in tucson  arizona  and the reserve on frankford  located in lubbock  texas  for an aggregate sales price of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of star pass  also located in tucson  arizona for an aggregate sales price of million see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to fund development and acquisition activity and for general working capital purposes 
we intend to invest in additional communities only as suitable opportunities arise 
we also plan to develop communities for our ownership and management 
in the short term  we intend to fund any acquisitions or developments with working capital  borrowings under first mortgage property secured debt  construction loans or borrowings under our fourth amended revolver 
we intend to finance property acquisitions and development projects over the longer term with cash from operations  the proceeds from potential asset sales  additional issuances of common or preferred stock  private capital in the form of joint ventures  debt financing and issuances of operating partnership units 
there can be no assurance  however  that such funding will be obtained on reasonable terms  or at all  particularly in light of current capital market conditions 
during  we completed eight collegiate housing community acquisitions see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for approximately million after acquisition costs 
the trust funded these acquisitions with assumed debt of million and existing cash  including cash proceeds generated by the january and november common stock offerings and sales of collegiate housing communities as discussed above 
we have eleven active development projects that we are developing for our ownership with our share of aggregate development costs of million 
through december   million of the anticipated costs had been incurred and funded 
in january  we completed the purchase of the reserve on stinson  near the university of oklahoma in norman  oklahoma for a purchase price of million 
we previously owned a equity interest in the community and managed the property prior to the acquisition 
the reserve on stinson has beds and is less than a half mile from campus 
in the third quarter of we completed the purchase of the province  near east carolina university in greenville  north carolina for a purchase price of million 
in the fourth quarter of we completed the purchase of the district on th serving the university of arizona  campus village serving michigan state university  the province at kent state serving kent state university and the suites at overton park and the centre at overton park both serving texas tech university for a combined purchase price of million and a total  beds see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the trust funded these acquisitions with assumed debt of million and existing cash  including cash proceeds generated by the august common stock offering see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and sales of collegiate housing communities as discussed above 
on september   the trust filed an automatic shelf registration statement  which permits us to issue an unlimited number of securities  including equity or debt securities  from time to time in one or more transactions  depending on market conditions and terms 
the registration statement was automatically effective on september  
table of contents predevelopment expenditures our third party development consulting activities have historically required us to fund predevelopment expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits 
because the closing of a development project s financing is often subject to third party delay  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these predevelopment expenditures before a financing commitment has been obtained and  accordingly  bear the risk of the loss of these predevelopment expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms 
however  we typically obtain a guarantee of repayment of these predevelopment expenditures from the project owner  but no assurance can be given that we would be successful in collecting the amount guaranteed in the event that project financing is not obtained 
when we develop projects for ownership  as opposed to our third party development services  the trust bears all exposure to risks and capital requirements for these developments 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary for scheduled debt maturities  renovations and other non recurring capital expenditures that are needed periodically for our communities 
we expect to meet these needs through existing working capital  cash provided by operations  additional borrowings under our fourth amended revolver  net proceeds from potential asset sales  the issuance of equity instruments  including common or preferred stock  operating partnership units or additional debt  if market conditions permit 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 
market conditions  however  may make additional capital more expensive for us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing under satisfactory conditions  or at all  or that we will make any investments in additional communities 
our fourth amended revolver is a material source to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
as such  compliance with the financial and operating debt covenants is material to our liquidity 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to our third amended revolver 
capital expenditures the historical recurring capital expenditures  excluding discontinued operations  at our wholly owned communities are set forth as follows as of and for the years ended december  total units total beds total recurring capital expenditures in thousands average per unit average per bed recurring capital expenditures exclude capital spending on renovations  community repositioning or other major periodic projects 
capital expenditures associated with newly developed communities are typically capitalized as part of their development costs 
as a result  such communities typically require little to no recurring capital expenditures until their second year of operation or later 
additionally  we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute contractual amounts annually to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at the mortgaged communities 
these contributions are typically less than  but could exceed  the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred during any given year at such communities 

table of contents commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands less than year years years more than years total contractual obligations long term debt obligations contractual interest obligations operating lease and future purchase obligations capital reserve obligations total includes required monthly principal amortization and amounts due at maturity on first mortgage debt secured by collegiate housing properties and any amounts due under the fourth amended revolver and construction loan agreements

includes future annual contributions to the capital reserve as required by certain mortgage debt 
long term indebtedness as of december   of our communities were unencumbered by mortgage debt 
as of december   we had outstanding mortgage and construction indebtedness of million net of unamortized debt premium of million 
the scheduled future maturities of this indebtedness as of december  were as follows in thousands year thereafter total debt premium outstanding as of december   net of debt premium as of december   the outstanding mortgage and construction debt had a weighted average interest rate of and carried an average term to maturity of years 
the trust had million outstanding under the third amended revolver as of december  as discussed above  the third amended revolver was replaced with the fourth amended revolver in january the fourth amended revolver has a term of four years and matures on january   and provides that the operating partnership may extend the maturity date one year subject to certain conditions 
the fourth amended revolver requires interest only payments through maturity 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the fourth amended revolver is  at the operating partnership s option  equal to a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin based upon our leverage 
the interest rate applicable to the third amended revolver as of december  was 

table of contents distributions we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income excluding the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gains on an annual basis in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we intend to make  but are not contractually bound to make  regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock and operating partnership units 
all such distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board 
we may be required to use borrowings under our fourth amended revolver  if necessary  to meet reit distribution requirements  avoid the imposition of federal income and excise taxes and maintain our reit status 
additionally  we may make certain distributions consisting of both cash and shares to meet reit distribution requirements 
we consider market factors and our performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels 
during the third quarter of  our board increased the annual dividend target from to per share unit becoming effective with the august  dividend 
during july of  our board increased the annual dividend target from to per share unit becoming effective with the august  dividend 
as discussed above  our board declared a fourth quarter distribution of per share of common stock for the quarter ended december  the distribution is payable on february  to stockholders of record at the close of business on january  off balance sheet arrangements the operating partnership entered into a letter of credit agreement in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition of a collegiate housing community at the university of florida 
as of december   the mortgage debt on this community was repaid see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and the million letter of credit is no longer outstanding 
the operating partnership serves as non recourse  carve out guarantor for secured third party debt in the amount of million  held by one unconsolidated joint venture 
the operating partnership is liable to the lender for any loss  damage  cost  expense  liability  claim or other obligation incurred by the lender arising out of or in connection with certain non recourse exceptions in connection with the debt 
pursuant to the operating agreement  the joint venture partner agreed to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the trust with respect to such obligations  except to the extent such obligations were caused by the willful misconduct  gross negligence  fraud or bad faith of the operating partnership or its employees  agents or affiliates 
therefore  exposure under the guarantee for obligations not caused by the willful misconduct  gross negligence  fraud or bad faith of the operating partnership or its employees  agents or affiliates is not expected to exceed the operating partnership s proportionate interest in the related mortgage debt 
in connection with the development agreement entered into on july  for a project at the science technology park at johns hopkins medical institute see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements the trust has committed to provide a guarantee of repayment of a million third party construction loan for a million fee 
the guarantee fee will not be recognized until the second mortgage loan is repaid 
the project will have a million reserve to fund any operating or debt service shortfalls that is to be replenished annually by east baltimore development  inc  until a debt service coverage ratio is achieved for twelve consecutive months 
the second mortgage loan and related debt service are the first at risk if such reserve is not adequate to cover operating expenses and debt service on the construction loan 
in connection with the condominium agreement related to the oaks on the square project in storrs  connecticut see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements the operating partnership and leylandalliance llc have jointly committed to provide a guarantee of repayment of a million construction loan to develop the residential and retail portions of the project 
as of december  and december   million and million  respectively  had been drawn on the construction loan of which million and million  respectively  is attributable to leylandalliance llc 
these amounts are not included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents non gaap measures funds from operations ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
in october  nareit communicated to its members that the exclusion of impairment write downs of depreciable real estate is consistent with the definition of ffo  and prior periods should be restated to be consistent with this guidance 
accordingly  we have restated all periods presented to reflect the current guidance 
we present ffo available to all stockholders and unitholders because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
as such  we also exclude the impact of noncontrolling interests in our calculation 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november  april and by the october guidance described above  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo available to stockholders and unitholders 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
the trust also uses core funds from operations  or core ffo  as an operating performance measure 
core ffo is defined as ffo adjusted to include the economic impact of revenue on participating projects for which recognition is deferred for gaap purposes 
the adjustment for this revenue is calculated on the same percentage of completion method used to recognize revenue on third party development projects 
core ffo also includes adjustments to exclude the impact of straight line adjustments for ground leases  gains losses on extinguishment of debt  transaction costs related to acquisitions and reorganization or severance costs 
we believe that these adjustments are appropriate in determining core ffo as they are not indicative of the operating performance of the trust s assets 
in addition  management uses core ffo in the assessment of the trust s operating performance and comparison to its industry peers and believes that core ffo is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing the trust to other reits as many reits provide some form of adjusted or modified ffo 

table of contents the following table presents a reconciliation of ffo and core ffo available to our stockholders and unitholders to net income loss for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands net income loss attributable to education realty trust  inc gain on sale of collegiate housing assets loss on impairment of collegiate housing assets real estate related depreciation and amortization real estate depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings of investees equity portion of loss on sale of collegiate housing property on equity investee noncontrolling interests ffo ffo adjustments loss on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs straight line adjustment for ground leases reorganization severance costs  net of taxes ffo adjustments ffo on participating developments interest on loan to participating development development fees on participating development  net of costs and taxes ffo on participating developments core ffo net operating income noi we believe noi is a useful measure of our collegiate housing operating performance 
we define noi as rental and other community level revenues earned from our collegiate housing communities less community level operating expenses  excluding management fees  depreciation  amortization  ground lease expense and impairment charges and including regional and other corporate costs of supporting the communities 
other reits may use different methodologies for calculating noi  and accordingly  the trust noi may not be comparable to other reits 
we believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from gaap operating income or net income 
the trust uses noi to evaluate performance on a community by community basis because it allows management to evaluate the impact that factors such as lease structure  lease rates and tenant base  which vary by property  have on the trust s operating results 
however  noi should only be used as an alternative measure of the trust financial performance 

table of contents the following is a reconciliation of our gaap operating income to noi for years ended december   and in thousands for the year ended december  operating income less third party development services revenue less third party management services revenue less operating expense reimbursements plus general and administrative expenses plus ground leases plus depreciation and amortization plus loss on impairment of collegiate housing assets noi adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as net income or loss excluding straight line adjustment for ground leases  acquisition costs  depreciation and amortization  loss on impairment of collegiate housing assets  gain on sale of collegiate housing assets  interest expense  other non operating expense income  income tax expense benefit  non controlling interest  and applicable expenses related to discontinued operations 
we consider adjusted ebitda useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of our operating performance between periods and between reits by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
the following is a reconciliation of our gaap net income loss to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december   and in thousands for the year ended december  net income loss attributable to common stockholders straight line adjustment for ground leases acquisition costs depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations loss on impairment of collegiate housing assets discontinued operations gain on sale of collegiate housing assets discontinued operations interest expense  net interest expense discontinued operations other nonoperating expense income income tax expense benefit non controlling interest applicable expenses income related to discontinued operations adjusted ebitda inflation our collegiate housing leases typically do not have terms that extend beyond twelve months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs 
however  our ability to raise rental rates may be limited by a weak economic environment  increased competition from new collegiate housing in our primary markets and or a reduction in student enrollment at our principal colleges and universities 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new authoritative guidance resulting in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and international financial reporting standards 
consequently  some of the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
the adoption had no material impact on the trust s consolidated financial statements  but resulted in additional fair value measurement disclosures see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued new authoritative guidance to simplify how entities test for goodwill impairment 
the new guidance allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if the entity concludes otherwise  it is required to proceed with performing step one of the goodwill impairment test and step two if necessary 
under the new guidance  an entity is no longer permitted to carry forward its detailed calculation of a reporting unit s fair value as previously permitted 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted 
the adoption had no material impact on the trust s consolidated financial statements as the trust will continue to assess goodwill impairment based on quantitative measures 
in december  the fasb updated the guidance related to property  plant and equipment real estate sales to eliminate diversity in practice regarding whether in substance real estate should be derecognized when the parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate because of a default of the subsidiary on its nonrecourse debt 
the updated guidance clarifies that the accounting for such transactions is based on substance rather than form  and a reporting entity generally would not satisfy the requirements to derecognize the in substance real estate before the legal transfer of the real estate to the lender and the extinguishment of the related nonrecourse debt 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after june  the adoption had no material impact on the trust s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the trust s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  the trust manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   we had fixed rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant  a basis point increase in interest rates would cause a million decline in the fair value for our fixed rate debt 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would cause a million increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
as of december   of the outstanding principal amounts of our mortgage and construction notes payable on the properties we own have fixed interest rates with a weighted average interest rate of and an average term to maturity of years 
as of december   we assumed million of variable rate mortgage debt in connection with the acquisition of the grandmarc at westberry place collegiate housing community located at texas christian university 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the loan is equal to a base rate plus a margin  in total not to exceed per annum  and principal and interest are paid on a monthly basis 
the loan matures on january  as of december   the interest rate applicable to the loan was 
as of december   we had borrowed million on construction loans related to the development of owned collegiate apartment communities 
these loans bear interest equal to a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin with
