cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and strategic investments 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of million  billion and million  respectively 
the net cash outflows from investing activities for the year ended december  decreased by billion compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the acquisition cost of hughes communications of billion  net of cash received and proceeds from the sale of a strategic investment of million  both of which provided a net cash outflow of billion for the years ended december  in addition  the decrease in net cash outflows was attributable to higher net sales of our marketable investment securities of million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in net cash outflows was partially offset by higher capital expenditures of million incurred in compared to the net cash outflows from investing activities for the year ended december  increased by billion compared to the same period in the increase was due to the acquisition costs of hughes communication of billion  net of cash received and higher capital expenditures of million incurred in compared to the increase in net cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a strategic investment of million in cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt and cash used for the repurchase  redemption or payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
for the years ended december   and  we reported a net cash outflows from financing activities of million  a net cash inflow from financing activities of billion  and a net cash outflows from financing activities of million  respectively 
the net cash outflows from financing activities decreased billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in and increased billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the change in net cash flow from to and from to was primarily due to the one time proceeds received of billion from the issuance of the notes in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued obligations and future capital requirements contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  future maturities of our contractual obligations are summarized as follows payments due in the year ending december  total thereafter in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations interest expense on long term debt and capital lease obligations satellite related obligations operating lease obligations purchase and other obligations payments in connection with acquisition total satellite related obligations primarily includes  among other things  costs for our capital lease satellites  transponder agreements and in orbit incentives relating to echostar xvi and echostar xvii  which were launched in the second half of in addition  satellite related obligations also includes our commitment relating to a launch contract we entered into with arianespace  sa in november to launch multiple new satellites over a multi year period 
our purchase and other obligations primarily consists of binding purchase orders for digital set top boxes and related components 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
the table above does not include million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax positions that were accrued as of december  and are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next months 
in certain circumstances  the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch  or lease of additional satellites 
off balance sheet arrangements other than from the transactions below  we generally do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities or use derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had million of letters of credit and insurance bonds 
of this amount  million was secured by restricted cash  million was related to insurance bonds  and million was issued under credit arrangements available to our foreign subsidiaries 
certain letters of credit issued by our foreign subsidiaries are secured by their assets 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of million  primarily in connection with a revenue contract in mexico 
from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts  or take other measures  to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued satellite insurance we generally do not carry insurance for any of the in orbit satellites that we use because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
however  pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing certain portions of our indebtedness  we are required  subject to certain limitations on coverage  to maintain launch and in orbit insurance for spaceway  echostar xvi  and echostar xvii 
the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance which we may not be able to mitigate by using available capacity on other satellites 
there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in orbit satellites were to fail 
in addition  the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could affect our ability to comply with federal communications commission and other regulatory obligations and our ability to fund the construction or acquisition of replacement satellites for our in orbit fleet in a timely fashion  or at all 
future capital requirements we primarily rely on our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  as well as cash flow generated through our operations to fund our investment needs 
since we currently depend on dish network for a substantial portion of our revenue  our cash flow from operations depends heavily on its needs for equipment and services 
to the extent that dish network s gross subscriber additions decrease or dish network experiences a net loss of subscribers  sales of our digital set top boxes and related components to dish network may further decline  which in turn could have a further material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  we entered into a launch agreement with arianespace  sa to launch multiple new satellites over a multi year period 
as of december   our remaining obligations related to echostar xvi  echostar xvii and the launch contract with arianespace  sa totaled million 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will have positive cash flows from operations 
furthermore  if we experience negative cash flows  our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances may be reduced 
we have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   our total indebtedness was billion 
our liquidity requirements will be significant  primarily due to our debt service requirements 
in addition  our future capital expenditures are likely to increase if we make additional investments in infrastructure necessary to support and expand our business  or if we decide to purchase one or more additional satellites 
other aspects of our business operations may also require additional capital 
we periodically evaluate various strategic initiatives  the pursuit of which also could require us to raise significant additional capital 
satellites as our satellite fleet ages  we will be required to evaluate replacement alternatives such as acquiring  leasing  or constructing additional satellites  with or without customer commitments for capacity 
we also may construct or lease additional satellites in the future to provide satellite services at additional orbital locations or to improve the quality of our satellite services 
stock repurchases pursuant to a stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors  we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding shares of class a common stock through and including december  during the years ended december  and  we did not repurchase any common stock under this plan 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock for  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments  and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment  and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
marketable and other investment securities we hold investments in debt and equity securities of various companies  including marketable investments in publicly traded securities and non marketable investments in securities of privately held companies 
our marketable investment securities ordinarily are accounted for as available for sale  accordingly  we report those securities at fair value on a recurring basis and generally recognize unrealized holding gains and losses in other comprehensive income 
except in unusual circumstances  the estimated fair values of our marketable investment securities are determined by reference to quoted prices for identical securities or based primarily on other observable market inputs 
our investments in non marketable securities typically are strategic investments in privately held companies and may be highly speculative 
we account for such investments using the equity method when we exert significant influence over the investee  otherwise  we account for such investments using the cost method 
all of our investments are subject to quarterly evaluations to determine whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred  in which case we record an impairment loss in determining net income 
for our marketable investment securities  our impairment evaluation considers factors such the length of time the security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position  the magnitude of the unrealized loss  current market conditions  company specific information  and whether we may dispose of the investment in the foreseeable future 
generally  it is not practicable to estimate fair value of our cost method and equity method investments on a recurring basis 
our impairment evaluation for such investments considers whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment impairment indicator 
in determining whether impairment indicators exist  we consider available information such as recent company financial statements  business plans and current economic conditions 
when we determine that an impairment indicator exists  we estimate the fair value of the investment and record an impairment loss if the estimated fair value is below the carrying amount of the investment 
in these circumstances  our fair value estimates may reflect significant unobservable inputs 
our periodic investment impairment evaluations require us to make significant estimates  judgments and assumptions about uncertain future events 
in some cases  there may be limited or no observable market data to support significant assumptions in our estimates 
as a result of weakening economic conditions  or other future events and changes in circumstances affecting our investments  we may subsequently determine that an investment is impaired or that an existing impairment is other than temporary 
such events and changes in circumstances could result in our recognition of material investment impairment losses in the future 
fair value of financial instruments fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data and the specific characteristics of the financial instrument 
weak economic conditions have in prior periods resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments  including certain debt securities that historically have been included in other investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
for certain of these instruments  there may be limited or no observable market data 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which limited or no observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience  bankruptcy and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and generally are less precise than measurements of fair value based on observable market data 
we make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date  credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including liquidity risks and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount 
in that event  an impairment loss is recorded in the determination of operating income based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using discounted cash flow techniques reflecting the estimated cash flows and discount rate that would be assumed by a market participant for the asset or asset group under review 
our discounted cash flow estimates typically include assumptions based on unobservable inputs and may reflect probability weighting of alternative scenarios 
impairment losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair value estimates are reduced for estimated selling costs 
changes in estimates of future cash flows  discounts rates and other assumptions could result in recognition of additional impairment losses in future periods 
impairment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we test our goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
there are two steps to the goodwill impairment test 
step one compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  it is necessary to perform the second step of the impairment test  which compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss 
a substantial majority of our goodwill was recorded in connection with our acquisition of hughes communications and was assigned to reporting units of our hughes segment 
we test such goodwill annually in our second fiscal quarter 
in our most recent test of such goodwill in the second quarter of  we estimated fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flow techniques  which included significant assumptions about prospective financial information  terminal value and discount rates 
based on this quantitative test  we determined that the fair values of the reporting units were in excess of the corresponding carrying amounts  including goodwill 
accordingly  we concluded that the goodwill was not impaired and it was not necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
if the estimated cash flows reflected in our fair value estimates were decreased by and or the discount rate used to discount such cash flows were increased by  a portion of our goodwill would have been impaired and it would have been necessary to perform step two of the impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of regulatory authorizations for the use of spectrum in specified orbital locations 
we test these intangible assets annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we recognize an impairment loss in the determination of operating income when we determine that the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair value is determined primarily using discounted cash flow techniques reflecting the estimated cash flows and discount rate that we believe would be assumed by market participants 
our cash flow projections typically include significant assumptions based on unobservable inputs 
changes in economic conditions  laws and regulations  technology  competition and other factors could affect the assumptions reflected in our fair value estimates and may result in future intangible asset impairments 
business combinations when we acquire a business  we assign the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities based upon their fair value using various valuation techniques  including the market approach  income approach  and or cost approach 
the accounting standard for business combinations requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired to be recorded at fair value 
transaction costs related to the acquisition of the business are expensed as incurred 
costs associated with the issuance of debt associated with a business combination are capitalized and included as a yield adjustment to the underlying debt s stated rate 
acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite 
amortization of these intangible assets is recorded on a straight line basis over an average finite useful 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued life primarily ranging from approximately one to twenty years or in relation to the estimated discounted cash flows over the life of the intangible 
revenue recognition our hughes segment enters into contracts to design  develop  and deliver telecommunication networks to customers in our enterprise market 
these contracts for telecommunication networks require significant effort to develop and construct the network  over an extended time period 
revenue under these contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
depending on the nature of the deliverables in each arrangement  we recognize revenue under the cost to cost method or the units of delivery method 
under the cost to cost method  sales are recorded equivalent to costs incurred plus a portion of the profit expected to be realized  based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
under the units of delivery method  sales are recorded as products are delivered and costs are recognized based on the expected profit for the entire agreement 
profits expected to be realized on long term contracts are based on estimates of total revenue and costs at completion 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the revisions are made 
estimated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
changes in our estimates related to revenue recognition for these contracts could result in significant changes in our revenue or costs  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
income taxes our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
any such valuation allowance is recorded in either income tax benefit provision  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements  and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax benefit provision  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
contingent liabilities a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period to selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we do not anticipate that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued seasonality for our echostar technologies and echostar satellite services segments  we are affected by seasonality to the extent it impacts our customers 
our customers in the pay tv industry  including dish network  our largest customer  typically experience seasonality 
historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers for the pay tv industry than the second half of the year 
however  we cannot provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
for our hughes segment  like many communications infrastructure equipment vendors  a higher amount of our hardware revenues occur in the second half of the year due to our customers annual procurement and budget cycles 
large enterprises and operators often allocate their capital expenditure budgets at the beginning of their fiscal year which often coincides with the calendar year 
the typical sales cycle for large complex system procurements is to months  which often results in the customer expenditure occurring towards the end of the year 
customers often seek to expend the budgeted funds prior to the end of the year and the next budget cycle 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures or contractual terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments and foreign currency our investments and debt are exposed to market risks  discussed below 
cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of billion 
of the billion  a total of billion was invested in a cash  b variable rate demand notes convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments  and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
the value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses  however  this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer 
interest rate risk a change in interest rates would not affect the fair value of our cash  or materially affect the fair value of our cash equivalents due to their maturities of less than days 
a change in interest rates would affect the fair value of current marketable investment securities portfolio  however  we normally hold these investments to maturity 
based on our current non strategic investment portfolio of billion as of december   a hypothetical change in average interest rates during would not have a material impact on their fair value due to the limited duration of our investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended december  of 
a change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at different rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued strategic marketable investment securities as of december   we held current strategic investments in publicly traded common stock of several public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are held for strategic and financial purposes  are concentrated in a small number of companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of these investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
in general  the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
restricted cash and marketable investment securities and noncurrent marketable and other investment securities restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
based on our investment portfolio as of december   a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities 
other investment securities as of december   we had million of noncurrent public and nonpublic debt and equity instruments that we hold for strategic business purposes and account for under the cost or equity methods of accounting 
a hypothetical adverse change in the value of these debt and equity instruments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
foreign currency risk we generally conduct our business in united states dollars 
our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies  and it is therefore exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of december   we had million of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables outstanding  and foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of million in place to partially mitigate foreign currency risk related to forecasted collections on a mexican peso denominated revenue contract 
the differences between the face amounts of the foreign exchange contracts and their estimated fair values were not material as of december  the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates on the fair value of foreign currency denominated net assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries would be an estimated loss of million as of december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued derivative financial instruments in general we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting or speculative purposes 
however  as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts with notional value of million in place to partially mitigate foreign exchange risk  primarily in connection with a contract in mexico 
we evaluate our derivative financial instruments from time to time but there can be no assurance that we will not enter into additional foreign currency forward contracts  or take other measures  in the future to mitigate our foreign exchange risk
