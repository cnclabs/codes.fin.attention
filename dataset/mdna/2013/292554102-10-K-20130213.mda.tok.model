our business and operating segments we are a leading provider of debt management and recovery solutions for consumers and property owners across a broad range of assets 
we purchase portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables and manage them by partnering with individuals as they repay their obligations and work toward financial recovery 
in addition  through our subsidiary propel financial services  llc propel  we assist texas property owners who are delinquent on their property taxes by paying these taxes on behalf of the property owners in exchange for payment agreements collateralized by tax liens on the property 
we conduct business through two operating segments portfolio purchasing and recovery and tax lien transfer 
the operating results from our tax lien transfer segment are immaterial to our total consolidated operating results 
however  the total segment assets are significant as compared to our total consolidated assets 
as a result  in accordance with authoritative guidance on segment reporting  our tax lien transfer segment is determined to be a reportable segment 
portfolio purchasing and recovery our portfolio purchasing and recovery segment purchases receivables based on robust  account level valuation methods and employs proprietary statistical and behavioral models across the full extent of our operations 
these investments allow us to value portfolios accurately and limit the risk of overpaying  avoid buying portfolios that are incompatible with our methods or goals and align the accounts we purchase with our operational channels to maximize future collections 
as a result  we have been able to realize significant returns from the receivables we acquire 
we maintain strong relationships with many of the largest credit and telecommunication providers in the united states and possess one of the industry s best collection staff retention rates 
while seasonality does not have a material impact on our portfolio purchasing and recovery segment  collections are generally strongest in our first calendar quarter  slower in the second and third calendar quarters  
table of contents and slowest in the fourth calendar quarter 
relatively higher collections in the first quarter could result in a lower cost to collect ratio compared to the other quarters  as our fixed costs would be constant and applied against a larger collection base 
the seasonal impact on our business may be influenced by our purchasing levels  the types of portfolios we purchase  and our operating strategies 
collection seasonality with respect to our portfolio purchasing and recovery segment can also impact our revenue recognition rate 
generally  revenue for each pool group declines steadily over time  whereas collections can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on seasonality  as described above 
in quarters with lower collections eg  the fourth calendar quarter  revenue as a percentage of collections can be higher than in quarters with higher collections eg  the first calendar quarter 
in addition  seasonality could have an impact on the relative level of quarterly earnings 
in quarters with stronger collections  total costs are higher as a result of the additional efforts required to generate those collections 
since revenue for each pool group declines steadily over time  in quarters with stronger collections and higher costs eg  the first calendar quarter  all else being equal  earnings could be lower than in quarters with slower collections and lower costs eg  the fourth calendar quarter 
additionally  in quarters where a greater percentage of collections come from our legal and agency outsourcing channels  cost to collect will be higher than if there were more collections from our internal collection sites 
tax lien transfer our tax lien transfer segment focuses on the property tax financing industry 
our principal activity is originating and servicing property tax lien transfers in the state of texas 
with the property owner s consent  we pay the property owner s delinquent property taxes directly to the taxing authority  which then transfers its tax lien to us 
we then enter into a payment agreement with the property owner  creating an affordable payment plan 
revenue from our tax lien transfer segment for the period may  date of acquisition through december   comprised of total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  operating income from our tax lien transfer segment for the period may  date of acquisition through december   comprised of our total consolidated operating income for the year ended december  discontinued operations on may   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of our bankruptcy servicing subsidiary  ascension capital group  inc ascension 
accordingly  ascension s results of operations are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income

table of contents during the year ended december   we invested million in portfolios  primarily of charged off credit card  telecommunications  and bankruptcy portfolios  with face values aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value 
this is a million increase  or  in the amount invested  compared with the million invested during the year ended december   to acquire portfolios with a face value aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value 
during the year ended december   we invested million for portfolios with face values aggregating billion  for an average purchase price of of face value 
average purchase price  as a percentage of face value  varies from period to period depending on  among other things  the quality of the accounts purchased and the length of time from charge off to the time we purchase the portfolios 
we have recently seen a meaningful increase in the prices for portfolios directly from credit issuers  especially for fresh portfolios 
these are portfolios that are generally transacted within months of the consumer s account being charged off by the financial institution 
we believe this pricing increase is due to a reduction in supply of charged off accounts and constant demand in the marketplace 
given shifts in underwriting standards by financial institutions resulting in the lower volumes of charged off accounts  we expect that the pricing will remain at these elevated levels for a period of time 
we believe that pricing will decline when buyers who have paid prices that are too high are unable to realize a profit 
the current supply environment did not have a material impact on our portfolio purchases for  as we fulfilled much of our planned portfolio acquisition in the first half of the year  when pricing was more favorable 
however  our ability to purchase portfolios in at favorable prices may be adversely impacted 
should pricing trends continue in this manner  we expect to adjust our purchasing strategies away from fresh portfolios  and towards portfolios in alternative asset classes or aged portfolios  where pricing is not as elevated and where we believe that our operational model allows us to maintain acceptable profit margins 
collections by channel during  and  we utilized numerous business channels for the collection of charged off credit card receivables and other charged off receivables

table of contents changes in the investment in receivable portfolios revenue related to our investment in receivable portfolios comprises two groups 
first  revenue from those portfolios that have a remaining book value and are accounted for on the accrual basis accrual basis portfolios  and second  revenue from those portfolios that have fully recovered their book value zero basis portfolios and  therefore  every dollar of gross collections is recorded entirely as zero basis revenue 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable  we account for such portfolios on the cost recovery method cost recovery portfolios 
no revenue is recognized on cost recovery portfolios until the cost basis has been fully recovered  at which time they become zero basis portfolios

table of contents on november   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the restated credit agreement  with several banks and other financial institutions and lenders 
the restated credit agreement amended and restated  in its entirety  the prior credit agreement  pursuant to which the previous lenders provided a million revolving credit facility to encore 
the restated credit agreement bifurcates the prior revolving credit facility into a new term loan facility tranche of million and a revolving credit facility tranche of million for a total commitment of million 
the maturities of both facilities are five years  except with respect to a million subtranche of the term loan facility  which has a three year maturity

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies investment in receivable portfolios and related revenue 
as permitted by the authoritative guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios are permanently assigned to the pool 
the discount ie  the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
the purchase cost of the portfolios includes certain fees paid to third parties incurred in connection with the direct acquisition of the receivable portfolios 
in compliance with the authoritative guidance  we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
the interest method applies an internal rate of return irr  to the cost basis of the pool  which remains unchanged throughout the life of the pool  
table of contents unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in expected cash flows are generally recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the pool s irr over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the irr  but are recognized as an allowance to the cost basis of the pool  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as a reduction in revenue  with a corresponding valuation allowance  offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool similar to one loan for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to the cost basis of receivable portfolios and for provision for loss or allowance 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s irr applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and portfolio allowances 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable  we account for such portfolios on the cost recovery method as cost recovery portfolios 
the accounts in these portfolios have different risk characteristics than those included in other portfolios acquired during the same quarter  or the necessary information was not available to estimate future cash flows and  accordingly  they were not aggregated with other portfolios 
under the cost recovery method of accounting  no income is recognized until the purchase price of a cost recovery portfolio has been fully recovered 
deferred court costs 
we contract with a nationwide network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters 
we generally refer charged off accounts to our contracted attorneys when we believe the related consumer has sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness and has  to date  been unwilling to pay 
in connection with our agreements with our contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs  or deferred court costs 
we capitalize these costs in the consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will ultimately be uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced and recovered  or that we anticipate recovering 
deferred court costs not recovered within three years of placement are fully written off 
property tax payment agreements receivable  net 
purchased property tax payment agreements receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balances  adjusted for  if any  charge offs  allowance for losses  deferred fees or costs  and unamortized premiums or discounts 
interest income is reported on the interest method and includes amortization of net deferred fees and costs over the term of the agreements 
we accrue interest on all past due property tax payment agreements receivable due as the receivables are collateralized by tax liens that are in a priority position over most other liens on the properties 
if there is doubt about the ultimate collection of the accrued interest on a specific receivable  it would be placed on non accrual and  at that time  any accrued interest would be reversed 
the allowance for losses on property tax payment agreements receivable is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the tax payment agreements in light of historical experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  and prevailing economic conditions 
to date  we have not experienced any losses on the property tax payment agreements receivable in our portfolio 
in addition  management believes  based on the fact that the tax liens that collateralize the tax payment agreements are in a priority position over most other liens on the properties  that it is unlikely that we will experience losses on the ultimate collection of the receivables 
therefore  no allowance has been provided on property tax payment agreements receivable in our portfolio as of december  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rates and foreign currency 
our interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging 

table of contents the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging requires that qualifying derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives  if any  is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
see note derivatives and hedging instruments to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform annual impairment analyses to assess the recoverability of the goodwill at each reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
effective july   we adopted the amended standard for goodwill impairment testing 
the amended standard allows companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the qualitative factors include economic environment  business climate  market capitalization  operating performance  competition  and other factors 
if quantitative analyses are required  we apply various valuation techniques to measure the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of reporting units including estimating future cash flows  and determining appropriate discount rates  growth rates  and other assumptions 
we will perform additional impairment testing if events occur or circumstances change between annual tests  that would more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are required to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses  market conditions and other factors 
stock based compensation 
we record compensation costs related to our stock based awards which include stock options  restricted stock awards  and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for performance based awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest 
income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of income 
when we reduce our valuation allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax benefit in our statement of income 
we include interest and penalties related to income taxes within our provision for income taxes 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 

table of contents use of estimates 
we have made significant estimates with respect to the rate of return established to recognize accretion revenue on our receivable portfolios and with respect to the provision for allowances of receivable portfolios 
in connection with these estimates  we have made significant estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from receivable portfolios owned 
significant estimates have also been made with respect to ascension s service revenue  the ability to realize our net deferred court costs  intangible assets  net deferred tax assets and tax reserve  stock based compensation  and the potential liabilities with respect to our health benefit plans 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to economic risks from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but the risks may impact our financial statements 
foreign currency exchange rates 
we have operations in india  which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in indian rupees  such as employee salaries and rent expenditures 
we continuously evaluate and manage our foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties where practicable 
such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that hedge our risk of foreign currency exchange against the indian rupee 
each contract settles monthly with a notional amount ranging from a united states dollar equivalent of million to million 
the contracts hedge the forecasted monthly cash settlements resulting from the expenses incurred by our operations in india 
we have not experienced any hedge ineffectiveness since the inception of the hedging program  a hypothetical change in the foreign exchange rate against the indian rupee would not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency risk that arises from the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities held by our subsidiary in india that are not denominated in our functional currency 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
interest rates 
we have variable interest bearing borrowings under our credit facilities that subject us to interest rate risk 
we manage our interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swap contracts with financial counterparties 
such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
we entered into several receive floating pay fixed interest rate swaps to hedge against potential changes in cash flows on our outstanding variable interest bearing debt 
the receive variable leg of the swaps and the variable rate paid on the underlying debt bear the same rate of interest  excluding the credit spread  and reset and pay interest on the same dates 
as of december   we have five interest rate swap contracts with financial counterparties with a total notional amount of million 
the contracts bear fixed annual interest rates ranging from to 
from the inception of the hedging program  the swaps have been determined to be highly effective 
a hypothetical change in the interest rates would not have an impact on our interest expense on the million hedged portion of our variable interest bearing debt 
the remaining balance of our variable interest bearing debt is subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
if the market interest rates for our variable rate agreements increase  interest expense on such outstanding debt would increase by approximately million  on an annualized basis 
conversely  if the market interest rates decreased an average of  our interest expense on such outstanding debt would decrease by million on an annualized basis 
our analysis and methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
