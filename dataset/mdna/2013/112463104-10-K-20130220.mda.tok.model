executive overview during  we continued to make progress in implementing our long term growth strategy  integrating previous acquisitions  and building a platform for future growth 
our primary long term growth objectives are to grow our revenues  adjusted ebitda  cash from facility operations and facility operating income primarily through a combination of i organic growth in our core business  including expense control and the realization of economies of scale  ii expansion  redevelopment and repositioning of existing communities  iii acquisition and consolidation of asset portfolios and other senior living companies  and iv continued expansion of our ancillary services programs including therapy  home health and hospice services 
the table below presents a summary of our operating results and certain other financial metrics for the years ended december  and and the amount and percentage of increase or decrease of each applicable item dollars in millions 
years ended december  increase decrease amount percent total revenue net loss adjusted ebitda cash from facility operations facility operating income net loss for and includes non cash impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
adjusted ebitda and facility operating income are non gaap financial measures we use in evaluating our operating performance 
cash from facility operations is a non gaap financial measure we use in evaluating our liquidity 
see non gaap financial measures below for an explanation of how we define each of these measures  a detailed description of why we believe such measures are useful and the limitations of each measure  a reconciliation of net loss to each of adjusted ebitda and facility operating income and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to cash from facility operations 

table of contents during the year ended december   we experienced an increase in our total revenues  primarily due to the addition of leased and managed communities from the horizon bay and hcp transactions in the third quarter of  along with increases in occupancy and average monthly revenue per unit  including an increase in our ancillary services revenue 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to billion  an increase of million  or  over our total revenues for the year ended december  resident fees for the year ended december   increased million  or from the prior year  and management fees  net of costs incurred on behalf of managed communities  increased million 
total management fees increased million  of which million consisted of reimbursed costs incurred on behalf of managed communities 
the increase was primarily due to the management agreements entered into or acquired in conjunction with the horizon bay and hcp transactions during the third quarter of in connection with these transactions  we added to our portfolio leased communities and managed communities after giving effect to our subsequent acquisition of one of the managed communities in the fourth quarter of 
the increase in resident fees during the year ended december  was primarily a result of a increase in the average monthly revenue per unit compared to the prior year  including growing revenues from our ancillary services programs  a basis points increase in average occupancy and a increase in consolidated units operated 
our weighted average occupancy rate for the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
the increases in occupancy rates were a result of improving fundamentals  execution by our field organization and sales and marketing team and the benefit of the capital we have invested and continue to spend on our communities 
beginning october   we were impacted by a reduction in the reimbursement rates for medicare skilled nursing patients and home health patients  as well as a negative change in the allowable method for delivering therapy services to skilled nursing patients resulting in increased therapy labor expense 
the cumulative negative financial impact of these changes increased our expense and decreased our revenue  facility operating income  adjusted ebitda and cash from facility operations for the year ended december  during the year ended december   our adjusted ebitda and facility operating income increased by and  respectively  and cash from facility operations decreased by  when compared to the prior year 
during the second quarter of  we changed the composition of our operating segments from four reportable segments to six reportable segments retirement centers  assisted living  ccrcs rental  ccrcs entry fee  isc and management services note 
this change was made to align operating segments with the basis that the chief operating decision maker uses to review financial information to make operating decisions  assess performance  develop strategy and allocate capital resources 
all prior period disclosures below have been recast to present results on a comparable basis 
during the year ended december   we acquired the underlying real estate associated with retirement center and assisted living communities that were previously leased for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during the year  we also acquired four home health agencies and an existing skilled nursing facility for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we continued to expand our ancillary services offerings 
as of december   we offered therapy services to approximately  of our units and home health services to over  of our units approximately  and  of these units  respectively  are in our consolidated portfolio 
we expect to continue to expand our ancillary services programs to additional units and to open or acquire additional home health agencies

loss on extinguishment of debt  net during  we recognized million as a loss on extinguishment of debt  related to costs incurred in connection with the early repayment of first and second mortgage notes 
income taxes the reduction in the income tax benefit over the prior year is due to a decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in this decrease is primarily due to the impact of our decision to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax benefit generated during critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate  or different estimates that could have been selected  could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect significant estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and assumptions at entrance fee communities our entrance fee communities provide housing and healthcare services through entrance fee agreements with residents 
under certain of these agreements  residents pay an entrance fee upon entering into the contract and are contractually guaranteed certain limited lifecare benefits in the form of healthcare discounts 
the recognition of entrance fee income requires the use of various actuarial estimates 
we recognize this revenue by recording the non refundable portion of the residents entrance fees as deferred entrance fee income and amortizing it into revenue using the straight line method over the estimated remaining life expectancy of each resident or couple  adjusted annually 
in addition  certain entrance fee agreements entitle the resident to a refund of the original entrance fee paid plus a percentage of the appreciation of the unit contingent upon resale 
we estimate the portion of such entrance fees that will be repaid to the resident from other contingently refundable entrance fees received or non refundable entrance fees received and record that portion as deferred revenue with the remainder classified as refundable entrance fees 
the portion recorded as deferred revenue is amortized over the life of the entrance fee building 
we periodically assess the reasonableness of these mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions  and measurement of future service obligations 
self insurance liability accruals we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
although we maintain general liability and professional liability insurance policies for our owned  leased and managed communities under a master insurance program  our current policies provide for deductibles for each and every claim 

table of contents as a result  we are effectively self insured for claims that are less than the deductible amounts 
in addition  we maintain a large deductible workers compensation program and a self insured employee medical program 
we have secured our obligations related to general liability  professional liability and workers compensation programs with cash aggregating million and letters of credit aggregating million as of december  we operate a wholly owned captive insurance company  senior services insurance limited ssil for the purpose of insuring certain portions of the risk retention under our general liability and professional liability insurance program  but ssil coverage is currently limited to claims made prior to third party insurers are responsible for claim costs above program deductibles and retentions 
the cost of our employee health and dental benefits  net of employee contributions  is shared by us and our communities based on the respective number of participants working directly either at our corporate offices or at the communities 
cash received is used to pay the actual costs of administering the program which include paid claims  third party administrative fees  network provider fees  communication costs  and other related administrative costs incurred by us 
claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
outstanding losses and expenses for general liability and professional liability and workers compensation are estimated based on the recommendations of independent actuaries and management estimates 
outstanding losses and expenses for our self insured medical program are estimated based on the recommendation of our third party administrator 
we review the adequacy of our accruals related to these liabilities on an ongoing basis  using historical claims  actuarial valuations  third party administrator estimates  consultants  advice from legal counsel and industry data  and adjust accruals periodically 
estimated costs related to these self insurance programs are accrued based on known claims and projected claims incurred but not yet reported 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized 
as of december  and  we have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
when we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made and reflected in income 
this determination will be made by considering various factors  including the reversal of existing temporary differences  tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences 
we have elected the with and without approach regarding ordering of windfall tax benefits to determine whether the windfall tax benefit did reduce taxes payable in the current year 
under this approach  the windfall tax benefits would be recognized in additional paid in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after considering all other tax benefits presently available to us 
lease accounting we determine whether to account for our leases as either operating or capital leases depending on the underlying terms 
as of december   we operated communities under long term leases with operating  capital and financing lease obligations 
the determination of this classification is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
our classification criteria is based on estimates regarding the fair value of the leased communities  minimum lease payments  effective cost of funds  the economic life of the community and certain other terms in the lease agreements as stated in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
communities under operating leases are accounted for in our consolidated statements of operations as lease expenses for actual rent paid plus or minus straight line adjustments for fixed or estimated minimum lease escalators and amortization of deferred gains 
for communities under capital lease and lease 
table of contents financing obligation arrangements  a liability is established on our balance sheets and a corresponding long term asset is recorded 
lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the remaining base lease obligations and the lease asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the lease 
in addition  we amortize leasehold improvements purchased during the term of the lease over the shorter of their economic life or the lease term 
sale leaseback transactions are recorded as lease financing obligations when the transactions include a form of continuing involvement  such as purchase options 
one of our leases provides for various additional lease payments based on changes in the interest rates on the debt underlying the lease 
all of our leases contain fixed or formula based rent escalators 
to the extent that the escalator increases are tied to a fixed index or rate  lease payments are accounted for on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
in addition  we recognize all rent free or rent holiday periods in operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term  including the rent holiday period 
for leases in which we are involved with the construction of the building  we account for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of asc if we conclude that we have substantively all of the risks of ownership during construction of a leased property and therefore we are deemed the owner of the project for accounting purposes  we record an asset and related financing obligation for the amount of total project costs related to construction in progress and the pre existing asset 
once construction is complete  we consider the requirements under asc leases sale leaseback transactions 
if the arrangement does not qualify for sale leaseback accounting  we continue to amortize the financing obligation and depreciate the building over the lease term 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  and represent our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis  using historical payment trends  write off experience  analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables  as well as a review of specific accounts  and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary 
recent changes in legislation are not expected to have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable  however  changes in economic conditions could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance calculations 
approximately and of our resident fee revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from private pay customers and and of our resident fee revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from services covered by various third party payor programs  including medicare and medicaid 
billings for services under third party payor programs are recorded net of estimated retroactive adjustments  if any  under reimbursement programs 
revenue related to these billings is recorded on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods or as final settlements are determined 
we accrue contractual or cost related adjustments from medicare or medicaid when assessed without regard to when the assessment is paid or withheld  even if we have not agreed to or are appealing the assessment 
subsequent positive or negative adjustments to these accrued amounts are recorded in net revenues when known 
long lived assets  goodwill and purchase accounting as of december  and  our long lived assets were comprised primarily of billion and billion  respectively  of net property  plant and equipment and leasehold intangibles 
in accounting for our long lived assets  other than goodwill  we apply the provisions of asc property  plant and equipment 
in connection with our formation transactions  for financial reporting purposes we recorded the non controlling stockholders interest at fair value 
acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase prices are allocated to acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values 
goodwill associated with our acquisition of arc and our formation transactions was allocated to the respective reporting unit and included in our application of the provisions of asc intangibles goodwill and other asc 
we account for goodwill under the provisions of asc as of december  and  we had million of goodwill 
we test long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for recoverability annually during our fourth quarter or whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset group is estimated by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash 
table of contents flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if this comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable  we are required to recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used  the carrying amount of those assets is permanently adjusted and depreciated over its remaining useful life 
during the years ended december  and  we evaluated long lived depreciable assets and determined that the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets for all except a small number of communities 
estimated fair values were determined and non cash asset impairment charges of million and million were taken for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these impairment charges are primarily due to lower than expected performance of the underlying communities and the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the estimated fair value or estimated selling prices 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual or more frequent impairment testing 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter  or whenever indicators exist that our goodwill may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is required to be assessed using a two step process 
the first step requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step requires a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill based on a putative purchase price allocation methodology with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
in  we adopted the guidance within accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other asu  which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this amendment  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
in  we assessed qualitative factors and determined that it was not necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently as required 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for that difference 
in estimating the fair value of long lived assets groups and reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test  we generally use the income approach 
the income approach utilizes future cash flow projections that are developed internally 
any estimates of future cash flow projections necessarily involve predicting an unknown future and require significant management judgments and estimates 
in arriving at our cash flow projections  we consider our historic operating results  approved budgets and business plans  future demographic factors  expected growth rates  and other factors 
future events may indicate differences from management current judgments and estimates  which could  in turn  result in future impairments 
future events that may result in impairment charges include increases in interest rates  which could impact discount rates  differences in the projected occupancy rates and changes in the cost structure of existing communities 
in using the income approach to estimate the fair value of long lived assets groups and reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test  we make certain key assumptions 
those assumptions include future revenues and future facility operating expenses  and future cash flows that we would receive upon a sale of the communities using estimated capitalization rates 
we corroborate the capitalization rates we use in these calculations with capitalization rates observable from recent market transactions 
where required  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital from a market participant perspective 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the recording of an impairment loss 

table of contents stock based compensation we adopted asc compensation stock compensation asc in connection with initial grants of restricted stock effective august  which were converted into shares of our restricted stock on september  in connection with our formation transaction 
asc requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock compensation based on the grant date fair value of the employee stock awards 
incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized when incurred 
certain of our employee stock awards vest only upon the achievement of performance targets 
asc requires recognition of compensation cost only when achievement of performance conditions is considered probable 
consequently  our determination of the amount of stock compensation expense requires a significant level of judgment in estimating the probability of achievement of these performance targets 
additionally  we must make estimates regarding employee forfeitures in determining compensation expense 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
litigation litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome of individual litigation matters is not predictable with assurance 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal actions and claims incidental to the conduct of our business which are comparable to other companies in the senior living and healthcare industries 
we have established loss provisions for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in other instances  we may not be able to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of uncertainties related to the outcome and or the amount or range of losses 
changes in our current estimates  due to unanticipated events or otherwise  could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements the information required by this item is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows dollars in thousands year ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year the increase in cash provided by operating activities was attributable primarily to increased cash provided by changes in working capital and  to a lesser extent  improved operating results 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and spending on property  plant  equipment  and leasehold intangibles 
the increase was partially offset by the sale of restricted marketable securities 
additionally  the prior year includes cash received from restricted cash and escrow deposits related to the release of escrows on a recently opened entrance fee ccrc and from the sale of assets 
the change in cash related to financing activities year over year was primarily attributable to an increase in the proceeds from debt related to the financing of current year acquisitions and a decrease in repayments of debt  as the prior year included both the repayment of debt on a recently opened entrance fee ccrc when entrance fees 
table of contents originally escrowed were released in accordance with state regulations  as well as repayments of debt from proceeds received in connection with the convertible debt offering in june additionally  there was an increase in the cash portion of the loss on extinguishment of debt and we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million in the prior year 
our principal sources of liquidity have historically been from cash balances on hand  cash flows from operations  proceeds from our credit facilities  proceeds from mortgage financing or refinancing of various assets  funds generated through joint venture arrangements or sale leaseback transactions  and with somewhat lesser frequency  funds raised in the debt or equity markets and proceeds from the selective disposition of underperforming and or non core assets 
over the longer term  we expect to continue to fund our business through these principal sources of liquidity 
our liquidity requirements have historically arisen from working capital  operating costs such as employee compensation and related benefits  general and administrative expense and supply costs  debt service and lease payments  acquisition consideration and transaction costs  cash collateral required to be posted in connection with our interest rate swaps and related financial instruments  capital expenditures and improvements  including the expansion of our current communities and the development of new communities  dividend payments  purchases of common stock under our share repurchase authorizations  and other corporate initiatives including integration and branding 
over the near term  we expect that our liquidity requirements will primarily arise from working capital  operating costs such as employee compensation and related benefits  general and administrative expense and supply costs  debt service and lease payments  capital expenditures and improvements  including the expansion  redevelopment and repositioning of our current communities and the development of new communities  other corporate initiatives including information systems and branding  acquisition consideration and transaction costs  and purchases of common stock under our share repurchase authorization 
we are highly leveraged and have significant debt and lease obligations 
as of december   we have three principal corporate level debt obligations our million revolving credit facility  our million convertible senior notes due and separate secured and unsecured letter of credit facilities providing for up to million of letters of credit in the aggregate 
the remainder of our indebtedness is generally comprised of non recourse property level mortgage financings 
at december   we had billion of debt outstanding  excluding capital lease obligations and our line of credit  at a weighted average interest rate of calculated using an imputed interest rate of for our million convertible senior notes due 
at december   we had million of capital and financing lease obligations  million was drawn on our revolving credit facility  and million of letters of credit had been issued under our letter of credit facilities 
approximately million of our debt and capital lease obligations are due on or before december  we also have substantial operating lease obligations and 
table of contents capital expenditure requirements 
for the year ending december   we will be required to make approximately million of payments in connection with our existing operating leases 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents at december   excluding cash and escrow deposits restricted and lease security deposits of million in the aggregate 
as of that date  we also had million of availability on our revolving credit facility of which million had been drawn as of december  
at december   we had million of negative working capital  which includes the classification of million of mortgage notes payable and million of refundable entrance fees as current liabilities 
although the mortgage notes payable are scheduled to mature on or prior to december   we have the option  subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions such as the absence of a material adverse change  to extend the maturity of approximately million of certain mortgages payable included in such debt until or later  as the instruments associated with such mortgages payable provide that we can extend the respective maturity dates for terms of five to seven years from the existing maturity dates 
we presently anticipate that we will either satisfy the conditions precedent for extending these obligations and will exercise the extension options or we will refinance or repay the million of mortgage notes payable at or prior to maturity 
based upon our historical operating experience  we anticipate that only to of the refundable entrance fee liabilities will actually come due  and be required to be settled in cash  during the next months 
we expect that any entrance fee liabilities due within the next months will be fully offset by the proceeds generated by subsequent entrance fee sales 
entrance fee sales  net of refunds paid  provided million of cash for the year ended december  for the year ending december   we anticipate that we will make investments of approximately million to million for net capital expenditures excluding expenditures related to our program max initiative discussed below  comprised of approximately million to million of net recurring capital expenditures and approximately million to million of expenditures relating to other major projects including corporate initiatives 
these major projects include unusual or non recurring capital projects  projects which create new or enhanced economics  such as major renovations or repositioning projects at our communities  integration related expenditures including the cost of developing information systems  and expenditures supporting the expansion of our ancillary services programs 
for the year ended december   we spent approximately million for net recurring capital expenditures and approximately million for expenditures relating to other major projects and corporate initiatives 
in addition  we have increased our efforts with respect to the expansion  redevelopment and repositioning of our communities through our program max initiative 
we anticipate making net investments of approximately million to million over the next months in connection with recently initiated or currently planned projects 
for the year ended december   we spent approximately million in connection with our program max initiative 
during  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be funded from cash on hand  cash flows from operations  lessor reimbursement and amounts drawn on our credit facility 
as opportunities arise  we plan to continue to take advantage of the fragmented senior housing and care sectors by selectively purchasing existing operating companies  asset portfolios  home health agencies and communities 
we may also seek to acquire the fee interest in communities that we currently lease or manage 
we expect to continue to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we enter into an acquisition or strategic arrangement with another company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any such sale of additional equity securities will dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all particularly given current market conditions 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities  any of which could reduce the growth of our business 
we currently estimate that our existing cash flows from operations  together with existing working capital  amounts available under our credit facility and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from anticipated financings and refinancings of various assets  will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months  assuming that the overall 
table of contents economy does not substantially deteriorate 
our actual liquidity and capital funding requirements depend on numerous factors  including our operating results  the actual level of capital expenditures  our expansion  development and acquisition activity  general economic conditions and the cost of capital 
shortfalls in cash flows from operating results or other principal sources of liquidity may have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our business and growth strategies 
the current volatility in the credit and financial markets may also have an adverse impact on our liquidity by making it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinancing 
as a result  this may impact our ability to grow our business  maintain capital spending levels  expand certain communities  or execute other aspects of our business strategy 
in order to continue some of these activities at historical or planned levels  we may incur additional indebtedness or lease financing to provide additional funding 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing will be available or on terms that are acceptable to us 
as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our outstanding debt and lease agreements 
credit facilities on january   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation  as administrative agent and lender  and the other lenders from time to time parties thereto 
the amended credit agreement amended and restated in its entirety our existing credit agreement dated as of february   as previously amended 
the amended credit agreement increased the commitment under the credit facility from million to million and extended the maturity date to january  effective february   the commitment under the amended and restated credit agreement was further increased to million 
the revolving line of credit can be used to finance acquisitions and fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien on certain of our communities 
the availability under the line will vary from time to time as it is based on borrowing base calculations related to the value and performance of the communities securing the facility 
amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at day libor plus an applicable margin  as described below 
for purposes of determining the interest rate  in no event will libor be less than 
the applicable margin varies with the percentage of total commitment drawn  with a margin at or lower utilization  a margin at utilization greater than but less than or equal to and a margin at greater than utilization 
we are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the facility 
the credit agreement contains typical affirmative and negative covenants  including financial covenants with respect to minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage and minimum consolidated tangible net worth 
a violation of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement  which would result in termination of all commitments under the credit agreement and all amounts owing under the credit agreement and certain other loan agreements becoming immediately due and payable 
as of december   we had an available secured line of credit with a million commitment and million of availability of which million had been drawn as of that date 
we also had secured and unsecured letter of credit facilities of up to million in the aggregate as of december  letters of credit totaling million had been issued under these facilities as of that date 
convertible debt offering in june  we completed a registered offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes the notes 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after the deduction of underwriting commissions and offering expenses 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to pay our cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described below  taking into account our proceeds from the warrant transactions described below  and used the balance of the net proceeds to repay existing outstanding debt 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all of our other senior unsecured 
table of contents debt  if any 
the notes will be senior in right of payment to any of our debt which is subordinated by its terms to the notes if any 
the notes are also structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities and commitments including trade payables of our subsidiaries 
the notes are also effectively subordinated to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually in cash 
the notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
holders may convert their notes at their option prior to the close of business on the second trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date only under the following circumstances i during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending september   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day  ii during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period  in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day  or iii upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
on and after march   until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
unconverted notes mature at par in june upon conversion  we will satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering  as the case may be  cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election 
it is our current intent and policy to settle the principal amount of the notes or  if less  the amount of the conversion obligation in cash upon conversion 
in addition  following certain corporate transactions  we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert in connection with such transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock as set forth in the supplemental indenture governing the notes 
in connection with the offering of the notes  in june  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the convertible note hedges with certain financial institutions the hedge counterparties 
the convertible note hedges cover  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments   shares of common stock 
we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties whereby the company sold to the hedge counterparties warrants to acquire  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  up to  shares of common stock the sold warrant transactions 
the warrants have a strike price of per share  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to common stock upon conversion of the notes in the event that the price per share of common stock at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedges  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the notes and is similarly subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
if  however  the price per share of common stock exceeds the strike price of the sold warrant transactions when they expire  there would be additional dilution from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the warrants 
the convertible note hedges and sold warrant transactions are separate transactions in each case entered into by us and the hedge counterparties  are not part of the terms of the notes and will not affect the holders rights under the notes 
holders of the notes do not have any rights with respect to the convertible note hedges or the sold warrant transactions 
these hedging transactions had a net cost of approximately million  which was paid from the proceeds of the notes and recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
contractual commitments the following table presents a summary of our material indebtedness  including the related interest payments  lease and other contractual commitments  as of december  
table of contents payments due by twelve months ending december  total thereafter dollars in thousands contractual obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations refundable entrance fee obligations total contractual obligations total commercial construction commitments includes contractual interest for all fixed rate obligations and assumes interest on variable rate instruments at the december  rate after giving effect to in place interest rate swaps 
reflects future cash payments after giving effect to non contingent lease escalators and assumes payments on variable rate instruments at the december  rate 
future refunds of entrance fees are estimated based on historical payment trends 
these refund obligations are generally offset by proceeds received from resale of the vacated apartment units 
historically  proceeds from resales of entrance fee units each year generally offset refunds paid and generate excess cash to us 
the foregoing amounts exclude outstanding letters of credit of million as of december  company indebtedness  long term leases and hedging agreements indebtedness as of december   we have three principal corporate level debt obligations our million revolving credit facility  our million convertible senior notes due and separate secured and unsecured letter of credit facilities providing for up to million of letters of credit in the aggregate 
the remainder of our indebtedness is generally comprised of non recourse property level mortgage financings 
as of december  and  our outstanding property level secured debt and capital leases were billion and billion  respectively 
in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements  as of december   the current portion of long term debt within our consolidated financial statements reflects approximately million and million of our mortgage notes payable and capital lease obligations  respectively  due within the next months 
although the mortgage notes payable are scheduled to mature on or prior to december   we have the option  subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions such as the absence of a material adverse change  to extend the maturity of approximately million of certain mortgages payable included in such debt until or later  as the instruments associated with such mortgages payable provide that we can extend the respective maturity dates for terms of five to seven years from the existing maturity dates 
we presently anticipate that we will either satisfy the conditions precedent for extending these obligations and will exercise the extension options or we will refinance or repay the million of mortgage notes payable at or prior to maturity 
during  we incurred million of property level debt primarily related to the financing of acquisitions  the expansion of certain communities  the refinancing of existing debt and the releveraging of certain assets 
approximately million of the new debt was issued at a variable interest rate and the remaining million was issued at a fixed interest rate 
refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the new debt and related terms 
we have secured self insured retention risk under workers compensation and general liability and professional liability programs with cash and letters of credit 
cash securing the programs aggregated million and million as of december  and  respectively 
letters of credit securing the programs aggregated million as of december  and as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our outstanding debt agreements 

table of contents long term leases as of december   we have communities operated under long term leases 
the leases relating to these communities are generally fixed rate leases with annual escalators that are either fixed or tied to changes in leased property revenue or the consumer price index 
one portfolio lease has a floating rate debt component built into the lease payments 
the lease includes million of variable rate mortgages and or tax exempt debt that is credit enhanced 
for the year ended december   our minimum annual cash lease payments for our capital financing leases and operating leases were million and million  respectively 
as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our capital and operating leases 
hedging in the normal course of business  we use a variety of financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk 
we have entered into certain interest rate protection and swap agreements to effectively cap or convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
as of december   we have million in aggregate notional amount of interest rate caps  million in aggregate notional amount of swaps and million of variable rate debt  excluding our secured line of credit and capital lease obligations  that is not subject to any cap or swap agreements 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value

these revenues are affected by the amount of monthly resident fee rates 
table of contents and community occupancy rates 
the rates charged are highly dependent on local market conditions and the competitive environment in which our communities operate 
substantially all of our retirement center  assisted living  and ccrc residency agreements allow for adjustments in the monthly fee payable not less frequently than every or months which enables us to seek increases in monthly fees due to inflation  increased levels of care or other factors 
any pricing increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy in the communities 
we believe  however  that our ability to periodically adjust the monthly fee serves to reduce the adverse effect of inflation 
in addition  employee compensation expense is a principal element of facility operating costs and is also dependent upon local market conditions 
there can be no assurance that resident fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes 
at december   approximately million of our indebtedness  excluding our line of credit  bears interest at floating rates 
we have mitigated our exposure to floating rates by using interest rate swaps and interest rate caps under our debt lease arrangements 
inflation  and its impact on floating interest rates  could affect the amount of interest payments due on our line of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements the equity method of accounting has been applied in the accompanying financial statements with respect to our investment in unconsolidated ventures that are not considered vies as we do not possess a controlling financial interest 
we do not believe these off balance sheet arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
non gaap financial measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable gaap measure 
in this report  we define and use the non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda  cash from facility operations and facility operating income  as set forth below 
adjusted ebitda definition of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as follows net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes  non operating income expense items  gain loss on sale or acquisition of communities including gain loss on facility lease termination  depreciation and amortization including non cash impairment charges  straight line lease expense income  amortization of deferred gain  amortization of deferred entrance fees  non cash stock based compensation expense  and change in future service obligation  and including 
table of contents entrance fee receipts and refunds excluding i first generation entrance fee receipts from the sale of units at a recently opened entrance fee ccrc prior to stabilization and ii first generation entrance fee refunds not replaced by second generation entrance fee receipts at the recently opened community prior to stabilization 
in the first quarter of  we revised the definition of adjusted ebitda to clarify the point at which first generation entrance fee receipts and refunds at recently opened entrance fee ccrcs will be included 
we determine the stabilization date of recently opened entrance fee communities to be the first day of the first full fiscal quarter occurring two years subsequent to the community opening date for occupancy of all levels of care on the campus 
as a result of this change  beginning in the first quarter of  we include all net entrance fee activity from a recently opened entrance fee ccrc in our non gaap financial measures 
for the year ended december   first generation net entrance fee receipts which would have been excluded under the previous definition of adjusted ebitda were million 
management use of adjusted ebitda we use adjusted ebitda to assess our overall financial and operating performance 
we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful in identifying trends in our day to day performance because the items excluded have little or no significance on our day to day operations 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
adjusted ebitda provides us with a measure of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as the change in the liability for the obligation to provide future services under existing lifecare contracts  depreciation and amortization including non cash impairment charges  straight line lease expense income  taxation and interest expense associated with our capital structure 
this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis 
adjusted ebitda is also used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance of and value companies in our industry 
limitations of adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate adjusted ebitda  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net income loss  include the cash portion of interest expense  income tax benefit provision and non recurring charges related to gain loss on sale of communities and extinguishment of debt activities generally represent charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results  and depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our communities  which affects the services we provide to our residents and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures 
an investor or potential investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position 
we use non gaap financial measures to supplement our gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda is not an alternative to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to gaap net income loss  along with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the 
table of contents adjusted ebitda measure  as presented in this report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the table below shows the reconciliation of our net loss to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands years ended december  net loss provision benefit for income taxes other non operating income expense equity in loss earnings of unconsolidated ventures loss on extinguishment of debt  net interest expense debt capitalized lease obligation amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount change in fair value of derivatives and amortization interest income income from operations gain loss on facility lease termination loss on sale of communities  net loss gain on acquisition depreciation and amortization asset impairment straight line lease expense amortization of deferred gain amortization of entrance fees non cash stock based compensation expense change in future service obligation entrance fee receipts first generation entrance fees received entrance fee disbursements adjusted ebitda the calculation of adjusted ebitda includes integration  transaction related and emr roll out costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no such costs in includes the receipt of refundable and non refundable entrance fees 
first generation entrance fees received represents initial entrance fees received from the sale of units at a recently opened entrance fee ccrc prior to stabilization 
entrance fee refunds disbursed excludes million of first generation entrance fee refunds not replaced by second generation entrance fee receipts at a recently opened entrance fee ccrc prior to stabilization for the year ended december  cash from facility operations definition of cash from facility operations we define cash from facility operations cffo as follows 
table of contents net cash provided by used in operating activities adjusted for changes in operating assets and liabilities  deferred interest and fees added to principal  refundable entrance fees received  first generation entrance fee receipts at a recently opened entrance fee ccrc prior to stabilization  entrance fee refunds disbursed adjusted for first generation entrance fee refunds not replaced by second generation entrance fee receipts at the recently opened community prior to stabilization  lease financing debt amortization with fair market value or no purchase options  gain loss on facility lease termination  recurring capital expenditures  net  distributions from unconsolidated ventures from cumulative share of net earnings  cffo from unconsolidated ventures  and other 
recurring capital expenditures include routine expenditures capitalized in accordance with gaap that are funded from current operations 
amounts excluded from recurring capital expenditures consist primarily of major projects  renovations  community repositionings  expansions  systems projects or other non recurring or unusual capital items including integration capital expenditures or community purchases that are funded using lease or financing proceeds  available cash and or proceeds from the sale of communities that are held for sale 
in the first quarter of  we revised the definition of cffo to clarify the point at which first generation entrance fee receipts and refunds at recently opened entrance fee ccrcs will be included 
we determine the stabilization date of recently opened entrance fee communities to be the first day of the first full fiscal quarter occurring two years subsequent to the community opening date for occupancy of all levels of care on the campus 
as a result of this change  beginning in the first quarter of  we include all net entrance fee activity from a recently opened entrance fee ccrc in our non gaap financial measures 
for the year ended december   first generation net entrance fee receipts which would have been excluded under the previous definition of cffo were million 
management use of cash from facility operations we use cffo to assess our overall liquidity 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial and liquidity goals as well as to achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
this metric measures our liquidity based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
cffo is one of the metrics used by our senior management and board of directors i to review our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness including our credit facilities and long term leases  ii to review our ability to pay dividends to stockholders  iii to review our ability to make regular recurring capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities on a period to period basis  iv for planning purposes  including preparation of our annual budget  v in making compensation determinations for certain of our associates including our named executive officers and vi in setting various covenants in our credit agreements 
these agreements generally require us to escrow or spend a minimum of between and per unit per year 
historically  we have spent in excess of these per unit amounts  however  there is no assurance that we will have funds available to escrow or spend these per unit amounts in the future 
if we do not escrow or spend the required minimum annual amounts  we would be in default of the applicable debt or lease agreement which could trigger cross default provisions in our outstanding indebtedness and lease arrangements

cffo does not represent cash available for dividends or discretionary expenditures  since we may have mandatory debt service requirements or other non discretionary expenditures not reflected in the measure 
material limitations in making the adjustment to our cash flow from operations to calculate cffo  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap operating cash flows  include the cash portion of interest expense  income tax benefit provision and non recurring charges related to gain loss on sale of communities and extinguishment of debt activities generally represent charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results  and depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our communities  which affects the services we provide to our residents and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures 
we believe cffo is useful to investors because it assists their ability to meaningfully evaluate our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness  including our credit facilities and capital and financing leases  our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and our ability to make regular recurring capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities 
cffo is not an alternative to cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on cffo as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of cffo to gaap net cash provided by used in operating activities  along with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because cffo is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the cffo measure  as presented in this report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

management use of facility operating income we use facility operating income to assess our facility operating performance 
we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful in identifying trends in our day to day facility performance because the items excluded have little or no significance on our day to day facility operations 
this measure provides an assessment of revenue generation and expense management and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as to achieve optimal facility financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
facility operating income provides us with a measure of facility financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as the change in the liability for the obligation to provide future services under existing lifecare contracts  depreciation and amortization including non cash impairment charges  straight line lease expense income  taxation and interest expense associated with our capital structure 
this metric measures our facility financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
facility operating income is one of the metrics used by our senior management and board of directors to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis 
facility operating income is also used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance of and value companies in our industry by investors  lenders and lessors 
in addition  facility operating income is a common measure used in the industry to value the acquisition or sales price of communities and is used as a measure of the returns expected to be generated by a community 
a number of our debt and lease agreements contain covenants measuring facility operating income to gauge debt or

the debt or lease coverage covenants are generally calculated as facility net operating income defined as total operating revenue less operating expenses  all as determined on an accrual basis in accordance with gaap 
for purposes of the coverage calculation  the lender or lessor will further require a pro forma adjustment to facility operating income to include a management fee generally to of operating revenue and an annual capital reserve generally to per unit
