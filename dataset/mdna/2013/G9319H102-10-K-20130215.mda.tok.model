for a variety of reasons  the company s historical financial results may not accurately indicate future performance 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
the risk factors set forth in item a above present a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained herein 

table of contents executive overview the company conducts its operations worldwide through three operating segments which have been determined under us gaap segment reporting  validus re  talbot and alphacat 
the company  provides reinsurance  insurance and insurance linked securities fund management 
validus re is a bermuda based reinsurer focused on short tail lines of reinsurance 
talbot is the bermuda parent of the specialty insurance group primarily operating within the lloyd insurance market through syndicate alphacat is a bermuda based investment adviser  managing third party capital in insurance linked securities and other investments in the property catastrophe reinsurance space 
the company s strategy has been to concentrate primarily on short tail risks  which has been an area where management believes current prices and terms provide an attractive risk adjusted return and the management team has proven expertise 
the company s profitability in any given period is based upon premium and investment revenues  less net losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and operating expenses 
financial results in the insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by the frequency and or severity of claims and losses  including as a result of catastrophic events  changes in interest rates  financial markets and general economic conditions  the supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity and changes in legal  regulatory and judicial environments 
on april   the company capitalized pacre  a new class bermuda reinsurer formed for the purpose of writing high excess property catastrophe reinsurance 
pacre was funded with million of contributed capital 
validus invested million in pacre common equity 
the company will underwrite business for pacre  for which it will be paid a profit commission based on pacre underwriting results 
as validus re holds a majority of pacre outstanding voting rights  the financial statements of pacre are included in the consolidated financial statements for the company 
the portion of pacre earnings attributable to third party investors for the year ended december  is recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
on may   the company announced that it has joined with other investors in capitalizing alphacat re alphacat re is a new special purpose reinsurer formed for the purpose of writing collateralized reinsurance with a particular focus on windstorm risks for florida domiciled insurance companies 
alphacat re was funded with million of equity capital 
the company will underwrite business for alphacat re  for which it will be paid a commission for originating the business and a profit commission based on underwriting results 
validus re has an equity interest and voting rights in alphacat re which is below  therefore the investment in alphacat re is included as an equity method investment in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
on november   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of flagstone  strengthening the company leading property catastrophe reinsurance and short tail specialty insurance platform 
for segmental reporting purposes  the results of flagstone s operations since the acquisition date have been included within the validus re segment in the consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company joined with other investors in capitalizing alphacat  a new special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of investing in collateralized reinsurance 
alphacat was funded with million of contributed capital 
validus re has an equity interest and voting rights in alphacat which is below  therefore the investment in alphacat is included as an equity method investment in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
on december   the company also received million of third party subscriptions for alphacat insurance linked securities ils funds 
written premiums are a function of the number and type of contracts written and the prevailing market prices 
renewal dates for reinsurance business tend to be concentrated at the beginning of quarters  with the timing of premiums written varying by line of business 
most property catastrophe business incepts january  april  june and july with an annual policy  while most insurance and specialty lines renewals are more evenly spread throughout the year 
written premiums are generally highest in the first quarter and lowest during the fourth quarter of the year 
gross premiums written for pro rata programs are initially recorded as estimates and are then adjusted as actual results become known 
pro rata reinsurance is a type of reinsurance whereby the reinsurer indemnifies the policyholder against a predetermined portion of losses in return for a proportional share of the direct premiums 
premiums are then generally earned over a month period and paid in monthly or quarterly installments 
the following are the primary lines in which the company conducts business property validus re underwrites property catastrophe reinsurance  property per risk reinsurance and property pro rata reinsurance 
property catastrophe includes reinsurance for insurance companies exposures to an accumulation of property and related losses from separate policies  typically relating to natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
property per risk provides reinsurance for insurance companies excess retention on individual property and related risks  such as highly valued buildings 
in property pro rata contracts the reinsurer shares the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion with 
table of contents the cedant 
alphacat underwrites property catastrophe reinsurance 
talbot primarily writes direct and facultative property insurance  lineslips and binding authorities and property treaty 
the business written is principally onshore energy  commercial and industrial insurance 
the business is short tail with premiums generally earned within one year and claims generally paid within two years 
marine the company underwrites insurance and reinsurance on marine risks covering damage to or losses of marine vessels or cargo  yachts and marinas  third party liability for marine accidents and physical loss and liability from principally offshore energy properties 
talbot underwrites both marine treaty reinsurance and insurance on a direct and facultative basis 
validus re underwrites marine reinsurance on an excess of loss basis  and to a lesser extent  on a pro rata basis 
specialty the company underwrites other specialty lines with very limited exposure correlation with its property  marine and energy portfolios 
validus re underwrites other lines of business depending on an evaluation of pricing and market conditions  which include aerospace  terrorism  life and accident health and workers compensation catastrophe 
with the exception of the aerospace line of business  which has a meaningful portion of its gross premiums written volume on a proportional basis  validus re s other specialty lines are primarily written on an excess of loss basis 
talbot underwrites war  political risks  political violence  financial institutions  contingency  accident and health  and aviation 
most of the talbot specialty business is written on a direct or facultative basis or through a binding authority or coverholder in conjunction with a significant aviation treaty account 
income from the company s investment portfolio primarily comprises interest income on fixed maturity investments net of investment expenses and net realized unrealized gains losses on investments 
a significant portion of the company s contracts provide short tail coverage for damages resulting mainly from natural and man made catastrophes  which means that the company could become liable for a significant amount of losses on short notice 
accordingly  the company has structured its investment portfolio to preserve capital and maintain a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of the company s investment portfolio consists of short term fixed maturity investments 
the company s fixed income investments are classified as trading 
under us gaap  these securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses are included in net income in the company s consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
the company s expenses consist primarily of losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses  and finance expenses related to debentures  senior notes and our credit facilities 
losses and loss expenses are a function of the amount and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts written and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
reserves for losses and loss expenses include a component for outstanding case reserves for claims which have been reported and a component for losses incurred but not reported 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  may result in losses and loss expenses materially different than the reserve initially established 
changes to prior year loss reserves will affect current underwriting results by increasing net income if a portion of the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or decreasing net income if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
adjustments resulting from new information will be reflected in income in the period in which they become known 
the company s ability to estimate losses and loss expenses accurately  and the resulting impact on contract pricing  is a critical factor in determining profitability 
since most of the lines of business underwritten have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophes  the company expects that claims experience will often be the result of irregular and significant events 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in  and could potentially have a material adverse effect on  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and ability to write new business 
the business written by talbot helps to mitigate these risks by providing us with significant benefits in terms of product line and geographic diversification 
acquisition costs consist principally of brokerage expenses and commissions which are driven by contract terms on reinsurance contracts written  and are normally a specific percentage of premiums 
under certain contracts  cedants may also receive profit commissions which will vary depending on the loss experience on the contract 
acquisition costs are presented net of commissions or fees received on any ceded premium 
general and administrative expenses are generally comprised of expenses which do not vary with the amount of premiums written or losses incurred 
applicable expenses include salaries and benefits  professional fees  office expenses  risk management  and stock compensation expenses 
stock compensation expenses include costs related to the company s long term incentive plan  under which restricted stock are granted to certain employees 
business outlook and trends we underwrite global specialty property insurance and reinsurance and have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made disasters 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events results in substantial volatility  and can have material adverse effects on the company s financial condition and results and ability to write new business 
this volatility affects results for the 
table of contents period in which the loss occurs because us accounting principles do not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur 
catastrophic events of significant magnitude historically have been relatively infrequent  although management believes the property catastrophe reinsurance market has experienced a higher level of worldwide catastrophic losses in terms of both frequency and severity in the period from to the present 
we also expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
the company seeks to reflect these trends when pricing contracts 
property and other reinsurance premiums have historically risen in the aftermath of significant catastrophic losses 
as loss reserves are established  industry surplus is depleted and the industry s capacity to write new business diminishes 
at the same time  management believes that there is a heightened awareness of exposure to natural catastrophes on the part of cedants  rating agencies and catastrophe modeling firms  resulting in an increase in the demand for reinsurance protection 
the global property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry has historically been highly cyclical 
since  increased capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of capital by existing insurers and reinsurers increased the supply of insurance and reinsurance which resulted in a softening on rates on most lines 
during there was an increased level of catastrophe activity  principally the chilean earthquake and the deepwater horizon events but the company continued to see increased competition and decreased premium rates in most classes of business 
during the january renewal season  validus re increased gross premiums written on its us cat xol lines and decreased gross premiums written in the proportional lines 
in addition  validus re decreased gross premiums written in the international property lines as market conditions dictated 
in the aftermath of s deepwater horizon loss  validus re saw additional opportunities and rate increases in the marine lines 
within its specialty lines  validus re increased gross premiums written in the terrorism lines among other sub classes 
until the third quarter of  premiums within talbot remained relatively stable  then significant price increases were seen across offshore energy  onshore energy and property classes 
most other classes also experienced low level rate increases as the lloyd s market responded to the year s highly publicized catastrophes including the christchurch earthquake  brisbane floods  tohuku earthquake and the thailand floods together with high frequency risk losses 
these increases were offset by some pricing pressure remaining in places  resulting in an overall price increase at a whole account level of for the year 
during the january renewal season  the validus re segment showed rate improvement relative to this improvement was largely due to the large catastrophe loss activity during during the first quarter of  talbot experienced rate increases in loss affected lines without seeing a systemic rise in rates across all lines 
during the july renewal period  the validus re segment experienced rate improvements in the us property lines while european and latin american property rates were unchanged 
the talbot segment experienced a rate increase of against a planned rate movement of across the portfolio  with marine treaty  property and energy related lines outperforming the plan 
during the january renewal season  the validus re and alphacat segments underwrote million in gross premiums written  an increase of from the prior year period 
this increase is driven primarily by an increase in gross premiums written in the specialty lines 
this renewal data does not include talbot s operations as its business is distributed relatively evenly throughout the year 
financial measures the company believes the following financial indicators are important in evaluating performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for shareholders annualized return on average equity represents the level of net income available to shareholders generated from the average shareholders equity during the period 
annualized return on average equity is calculated by dividing the net income available to validus for the period by the average shareholders equity available to validus during the period 
average shareholders equity is the average of the beginning  ending and intervening quarter end shareholders equity balances 
the company s objective is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward shareholders for the risks assumed and to grow revenue only when returns meet or exceed internal requirements 
details of annualized return on average equity are provided below 
three months ended december  years ended december  annualized return on average equity the decrease in annualized return on average equity was driven primarily by a decrease in net income available to validus for the three months ended december  net income available to validus for the three months ended december  decreased by million  or compared to the three months ended december  due primarily to losses incurred 
table of contents on hurricane sandy 
net income available to validus for the year ended december  increased by million  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to the decreased impact of notable loss events for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  diluted book value per common share is considered by management to be an appropriate measure of our returns to common shareholders  as we believe growth in our book value on a diluted basis ultimately translates into growth of our stock price 
diluted book value per common share after dividends paid  increased by  or  from at december  to at december  the increase was due to the income generated during the year ended december  diluted book value per common share is a non gaap financial measure 
the most comparable us gaap financial measure is book value per common share 
diluted book value per common share is calculated based on total shareholders equity plus the assumed proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  divided by the sum of common shares  unvested restricted shares  options and warrants outstanding assuming their exercise 
a reconciliation of diluted book value per common share to book value per common share is presented below in the section entitled other non gaap financial measures 
cash dividends per common share are an integral part of the value created for shareholders 
the company declared quarterly cash dividends of per common share and common share equivalent in each of the four quarters of on february   the company announced an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to per common share and per common share equivalent for which each outstanding warrant is exercisable  payable on march  to holders of record on march  in addition  the company announced a special dividend in the amount of per common share and per common share equivalent for which each outstanding warrant is exercisable  payable on february  to shareholders and warrant holders of record as of february  underwriting income measures the performance of the company s core underwriting function  excluding revenues and expenses such as net investment income loss  other income  finance expenses  net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments  foreign exchange gains losses  gain on bargain purchase  net of expenses and transaction expenses 
the company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the company s core insurance and reinsurance operations 
underwriting loss for the three months ended december  was million and underwriting income for the three months ended december  was million 
underwriting income for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
underwriting income is a non gaap financial measure as described in detail and reconciled to net income in the section below entitled underwriting loss income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported and disclosed amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management believes the following accounting policies are critical to the company s financial reporting as the application of these policies requires management to make significant judgments 
management believes the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are reserve for losses and loss expenses  premiums  reinsurance premiums ceded and reinsurance recoverable and investment valuation 
reserve for losses and loss expenses description we believe that the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of reserve for losses and loss expenses 
the company establishes its reserve for losses and loss expenses to cover the estimated remaining liability incurred for both reported claims case reserves and unreported amounts incurred but not reported or ibnr reserves 
for insurance and reinsurance business  the ibnr reserves include provision for loss incidents that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the company as well as for future variation in case reserves where the claim has been reported but the ultimate cost is not yet known 
the provision for future variation in current case reserves is generally calculated using actuarial estimates of total ibnr at the aggregated line of business level 
additional individual claim ibnr amounts are sometimes calculated for larger claims within our insurance and reinsurance businesses 
within the reinsurance business  the portion of total ibnr related to future variation on known claims is calculated at the individual claim level in some instances either as an additional case reserve or individual claim ibnr 
within the insurance business  the provision for future variation in current case reserves is generally calculated using actuarial estimates of total ibnr  while individual claim ibnr amounts are sometimes calculated for larger claims 
for alphacat  talbot and validus re  ibnr is established separately for certain large or catastrophe losses and smaller attritional losses 
the company has procedures in place to aggregate large or catastrophe losses on a consolidated basis for financial reporting and disclosure purposes 
for disclosure purposes  only those loss events which aggregate to over million on a consolidated basis are disclosed separately and included in the reserve for notable loss events and reserve for development 
table of contents on events tables 
notable loss events are first determined at the respective operating segments based on segment thresholds and are then aggregated and disclosed if it is determined that they reach the consolidated threshold for notable loss disclosure 
for all lines of business  the company s reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and loss reserves recoverable consist of three categories case reserves  in certain circumstances  additional case reserves acr  and ibnr reserves 
the reserves and recoverables for attritional and large or catastrophe losses are established on an annual and interim basis as follows case reserves case reserves generally are analyzed and established by each segment s claims department on all lines  making use of third party input where appropriate including  for the reinsurance business  reports of losses from ceding companies 
for insurance business where talbot is not the lead underwriter on the business  the case reserves are established by the lead underwriter and validated by the central lloyd s market claims bureau  with a sample reviewed by talbot 
acr reserves acrs are established for alphacat and validus re business by our claims department in cases where we believe the case reserves reported by the cedant require adjustment 
acrs supplement case reserves based on information obtained through ceding company audits or other sources 
acrs are not generally used at talbot as claim volumes are generally greater and thus the potential for future variation in case reserve estimates on known claims often can be analyzed at an aggregate level using historical data 
ibnr reserves a 
large or catastrophe events ibnr reserves are established for all lines based on each segment s estimates for known loss events for which not all claims have been reported to the company 
in establishing such ibnr reserves  the company accumulates loss information from modeling agencies  where possible  publicly available sources and information contained in client reports and estimates 
the loss information is applied to the company s book of in force contracts to establish an estimate of the company s ultimate exposure to the loss event 
for some large loss events  the company estimates an ultimate loss expectation for the individual event 
paid losses  case reserves and any additional case reserves are then deducted from the ultimate loss to ascertain the ibnr estimate for these individual large claims or catastrophe events 
the size of event for which the company establishes a separate ultimate loss estimate may vary based on an assessment of the materiality of the event  as well as on other factors 
b 
attritional losses ibnr reserves are established using some combination of the actuarial methods described above  including the chain ladder method  the generalized cape cod method and the bornhuetter ferguson method 
in situations where limited historic development data is available and or the year being analyzed is more recent less mature  the expected loss method and the bornhuetter ferguson method are more commonly used 
under all methods used at alphacat  talbot and validus re  an ultimate loss amount is established 
paid losses  case reserves and any additional case reserves are then deducted from the ultimate loss to ascertain the attritional ibnr reserves 
for all sources of ibnr  net reserves are estimated by first estimating gross ibnr reserves  then estimating reinsurance recoverables on ibnr 
judgments and uncertainties loss reserve estimates for insurance and reinsurance business are not precise in that they deal with the inherent uncertainty in the outcome of insurance and reinsurance claims made on the company  many of which have not yet been reported to the company 
estimating loss reserves requires management to make assumptions  both explicit and implicit  regarding future paid and reported loss development patterns  frequency and severity trends  claims settlement practices  potential changes in the legal environment and other factors 
these estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors  and may be revised over time as additional experience or other data becomes available  as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change 
as predominantly a broker market insurer and reinsurer  the company must rely on loss information reported to us by brokers from clients  where such information is often incomplete or changing 
the quality and type of information received varies by client and by the nature of the business  insurance or reinsurance 
in the insurance business  for risks that the company leads  the company receives from brokers details of potential claims  on the basis of which the company s loss adjusters make estimates of the likely ultimate outcome of the claims 
in determining these reserves  the company takes into account a number of factors including the facts and circumstances of the individual claim  the nature of the coverage and historical information about its experience on similar types of claims 
for insurance business where another company is the lead  the case reserves are established by the lead underwriter and validated centrally by the lloyd s market claims bureau  with a sample reviewed by the company 
the sum of the individual claim estimates for lead and follow business constitutes the case reserves 

table of contents for reinsurance business  the company typically receives from brokers details of paid losses and estimated case reserves recorded by the ceding company 
in addition to this  the ceding company s estimated provision for ibnr losses is sometimes also available  although this in itself introduces additional uncertainty owing to the differing and typically unknown reserving practices of ceding companies 
there will also be a time lag between a loss occurring and it being reported  first by the original claimant to its insurer  via the insurance broker  and for reinsurance business  subsequently from the insurer to the reinsurer via the reinsurance broker 
the company writes a mix of predominantly short tail business  both insurance and reinsurance 
the combination of low claim frequency and high claim severity that is characteristic of much of this short tail business makes the available data more volatile and less reliable for predicting ultimate losses 
for example  in property lines  there can be additional uncertainty in loss estimation related to large catastrophe events  whether natural or man made 
with wind events  such as hurricanes  the damage assessment process may take more than a year 
the cost of claims is also subject to volatility due to supply shortages for construction materials and labor 
in the case of earthquakes  the damage assessment process may take longer as buildings are discovered to have structural weaknesses not initially detected 
the company also writes longer tail insurance lines of business  predominantly financial institutions million of gross premiums written on a claims made basis and marine and energy liabilities million of gross premiums substantially written on a losses occurring basis for the year ended december  these longer tail lines represent of talbot s gross premiums written for the year ended december  for marine and energy liability  the time from the occurrence of a claim to its first report to the company can also be years 
for both marine and energy liability and financial institutions  the subsequent time between reporting of a claim and its settlement can be years 
in these intervening periods between occurrence  reporting and settlement  additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known and current laws and case law may change  affecting the ultimate value of the claim 
taken together  these issues add considerable uncertainty to the process of estimating ultimate losses  hence loss reserves  and this uncertainty is increased for reinsurance business compared with insurance business due to the additional parties in the chain of reporting from the original claimant to the reinsurer 
as a result of the uncertainties described above  the company must estimate ibnr reserves  which consist of a provision for future development on known loss events  as well as a provision for claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to us by clients 
because of the degree of reliance that is necessarily placed on brokers and re insured companies for claims reporting  the associated time lag  the low frequency high severity nature of much of the business underwritten  the rapidly emerging and changing nature of facts and circumstances surrounding large events and  for reinsurance business  the varying reserving practices among ceding companies as described above  reserve estimates are highly dependent on management s judgment and are subject to uncertainty 
the company strives to take account of these uncertainties in the judgments and assumptions made when establishing loss reserves  but it is not possible to eliminate the uncertainties 
as a result  there is a risk that the company s actual losses may be higher or lower than the reserves booked 
for the company s insurance business written by talbot  where a longer reserving history exists  the company examines the development of its own historical paid and incurred losses to identify trends  which it then incorporates into the reserving process where it deems appropriate 
for the company s reinsurance business  especially that written by validus re where the company relies more heavily on information provided by clients in order to assist it in estimating reserves  the company performs certain processes in order to help assess the completeness and accuracy of such information as follows in addition to information received from clients on reported claims  the company also uses information on the patterns of client loss reporting and loss settlements from previous events in order to estimate the company s ultimate liability related to these events  the company uses reinsurance industry information in order to perform consistency checks on the data provided by ceding companies and to identify trends in loss reporting and settlement activity 
where it deems appropriate  the company incorporates such information in establishing reinsurance reserves  and for both insurance and reinsurance business  the company supplements the loss information received from clients with loss estimates developed by market share techniques and third party catastrophe models when such information is available 

table of contents although there is normally a lag in receiving reinsurance data from cedants  the company currently has no backlog related to the processing of assumed reinsurance information 
the company actively manages its relationships with brokers and clients and considers existing disputes with counterparties to be in the normal course of business 
as described above  the reserve for losses and loss expenses includes both a component for outstanding case reserves for claims which have been reported and a component for ibnr reserves 
ibnr reserves are the difference between ultimate losses and reported losses  where reported losses are the sum of paid losses and outstanding case reserves 
ultimate losses are estimated by management using various actuarial methods  including exposure based and loss based methods  as well as other qualitative assessments regarding claim trends 
the company uses a reserving methodology that establishes a point estimate for ultimate losses 
the point estimate represents management s best estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
the company does not select a range as part of its loss reserving process 
the extent of reliance on management judgment in the reserving process differs depending on the circumstances surrounding the estimations  including the volume and credibility of data  the perceived relevance of historical data to future conditions  the stability or level of stability in the company s operational processes for handling losses including claims practices and systems and other factors 
the company reviews its reserving assumptions and methodologies on a quarterly basis 
two of the most critical assumptions in establishing reserves are loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios 
loss emergence patterns are critical to the reserving process as they can be one key indicator of the ultimate liability 
a pattern of reported loss emergence which is different from expectations may indicate a change in the loss climate and may thus influence the estimate of future payments that should be reflected in reserves 
expected loss ratios are a primary component in the company s calculation of estimated ultimate losses for business at an early stage in its development 
loss emergence patterns for the business written by talbot are generally derived from talbot s own historic loss development triangulations  supplemented in some instances by lloyd s market data 
for the business written by validus re  where its own historic loss development triangulations are currently more limited  greater use is made of market data including reinsurance industry data available from organizations such as statistical bureaus and consulting firms  where appropriate 
expected loss ratios are estimated in a variety of ways  largely dependent upon the data available 
wherever it deems appropriate  management incorporates the company s own loss experience in establishing initial expected loss ratios and reserves 
this is particularly true for the business written by talbot where a longer reserving history exists and expected losses and loss ratios consider  among other things  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
for reinsurance business  expected losses and loss ratios are typically developed using vendor and proprietary computer models 
the information used in these models is collected by underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business 
the company has large catastrophe event ultimate loss reserve estimation procedures for the investigation  analysis  and estimation of ultimate losses resulting from large catastrophe events 
the determination regarding which events follow these procedures is made by members of senior management from relevant departments within the company 
the procedures are designed to facilitate the communication of information between various relevant functions and provide an efficient approach to determining the estimated loss for the event 
in developing estimates for large catastrophe events  the company considers various sources of information including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants and policyholders  ceding company and overall insurance industry loss estimates reported by our brokers and by claims reporting services  proprietary and third party vendor models and internal data regarding insured or reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event 
use of these various sources enables management to estimate the ultimate loss for known events with a higher degree of accuracy and timeliness than if the company relied solely on one data source 
indicated ultimate loss estimates for catastrophe events are compiled by a committee of management  and these indicated ultimate losses are incorporated into the process of selecting management s best estimate of reserves 
as with large catastrophe events  the company separately estimates ultimate losses for certain large claims using a number of methods  including estimation based on vendor models  analyses of specific industry occurrences and facts  as well as information from cedants and policyholders on individual contract involvements 
during and  given the complexity and severity of notable loss events  an explicit reserve for potential development on and notable loss events rde was included within the company ibnr reserving process 
as uncertainties surrounding initial estimates on notable loss events develop  it is expected that this reserve will be allocated to specific notable loss events 
no rde was established for notable losses 
the requirement for a reserve for potential development on notable loss events in a quarter is a function of a the number of significant events occurring in that quarter and b the complexity and volatility of those events 
complexity and volatility factors considered are as follows contract complexity  nature and number of perils arising from an event  
table of contents limits and sub limits exposed  quality  timing and flow of information received from each loss  timing of receipt of information to the company  information regarding retrocessional covers  assumptions  both explicit and implicit  regarding future paid and reported loss development patterns  frequency and severity trends  claims settlement practices  and potential changes in the legal environment 
each of these factors may lead to associated volatility for each notable loss event as well as consideration of the total reserve for loss events in the aggregate 
consequently  all of these factors are considered in the aggregate for the events occurring in the quarter  recognizing that it is more likely that one or some of the events may deteriorate significantly  rather than all deteriorating proportionately 
the establishment of each quarter requirement for a reserve for potential development on notable loss events takes place as part of the quarterly evaluation of the company overall reserve requirements 
it is not directly linked in isolation to any one significant notable loss in the quarter 
the reserve for potential development on notable loss events is evaluated by our in house actuaries as part of their normal process in setting of indicated reserves for the quarter 
in ensuing quarters the senior management and the in house actuaries revisit and re estimate certain events previously considered in the catastrophe loss event process as well as events that have subsequently emerged in the current quarter 
to the extent that there has been adverse development on a notable loss event  if there is rde remaining from that accident year  an allocation from the respective accident year rde will be made to the notable loss event 
if there is no remaining rde relating to the accident year of the loss  then adverse development will be recorded for the notable loss event 
changes to the reserve for potential development on notable loss events will be considered in light of changes to previous loss estimates from notable losses in this re estimation process 
to the extent that there are continued complexity and volatility factors relating to notable loss events in the aggregate  additions to the rde may be established for a specific accident year  as illustrated in the rde roll forward table below 
management s loss estimates are subject to annual corroborative review by independent external actuaries using generally accepted actuarial techniques and other analytical and qualitative methods 
the company s reserving methodology was not changed materially in the year ended december  from the methodology used in the year ended december  for either validus re  alphacat or talbot 
management s best estimate of the gross reserve for losses and loss expenses and loss reserves recoverable at december  were  million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth a breakdown between gross case reserves and gross ibnr by segment at december  as at december  dollars in thousands gross case reserves gross ibnr total gross reserve for losses and loss expenses validus re alphacat talbot eliminations total management s best estimate of the gross reserve for losses and loss expenses and loss reserves recoverable at december  were  million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth a breakdown between gross case reserves and gross ibnr by segment at december  as at december  dollars in thousands gross case reserves gross ibnr total gross reserve for losses and loss expenses validus re alphacat talbot eliminations total 
table of contents to the extent insurance and reinsurance industry data is relied upon to aid in establishing reserve estimates  there is a risk that the data may not match the company s risk profile or that the industry s reserving practices overall differ from those of the company and its clients 
in addition  reserving can prove especially difficult should a significant loss event take place near the end of an accounting period  particularly if it involves a catastrophic event 
these factors further contribute to the degree of uncertainty in the reserving process 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  including changes in laws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms  may result in losses and loss expenses materially different from the reserves initially established 
changes to prior year reserves will affect current period underwriting income by increasing income if the prior year ultimate losses are reduced or decreasing income if the prior year ultimate losses are increased 
the company expects volatility in results in periods when significant loss events occur because us gaap does not permit insurers or reinsurers to reserve for loss events until they have both occurred and are expected to give rise to a claim 
as a result  the company is not allowed to record contingency reserves to account for expected future losses 
the company anticipates that claims arising from future events will require the establishment of substantial reserves in future periods 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions given the risks and uncertainties associated with the process for estimating reserves for losses and loss expenses  management has performed an evaluation of the potential variability in loss reserves and the impact this variability may have on reported results  financial condition and liquidity 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
management s best estimate of the net reserve for losses and loss expenses at december  is  million 
the following tables show the effect on estimated net reserves for losses and loss expenses as of december  of a change in two of the most critical assumptions in establishing reserves loss emergence patterns  accelerated or decelerated by three and six months  and expected loss ratios varied by plus or minus five and ten percent 
management believes that a reasonably likely scenario is represented by such a standard  as used by some professional actuaries as part of their review of an insurer s or reinsurer s reserves 
utilizing this standard as a guide  management has selected these variances to determine reasonably likely scenarios of variability in the loss emergence and loss ratio assumptions 
these scenarios consider normal levels of catastrophe events 
loss reserves may vary beyond these scenarios in periods of heightened or reduced claim activity 
the reserves resulting from the changes in the assumptions are not additive and should be considered separately 
the following tables vary the assumptions employed therein independently 
in addition  the tables below do not adjust any parameters other than the ones described above 
specifically  reinsurance collectability was not explicitly stressed as part of the calculations below

management believes that the reserve for losses and loss expenses is sufficient to cover expected claims incurred before the evaluation date on the basis of the methodologies and judgments used to support its estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that actual payments will not vary significantly from total reserves 
the reserve for losses and loss expenses and the methodology of estimating such reserve are regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes known 
any resulting adjustments are reflected in income in the period in which they become known 
premiums description for insurance business  written premium estimates are determined from the business plan estimates of premiums by class  the aggregate of underwriters estimates on a policy by policy basis  and projections of ultimate premiums using generally accepted actuarial methods 
in particular  direct insurance premiums are recognized in accordance with the type of contract written 
the majority of our insurance premium is accepted on a direct open market or facultative basis 
we receive a premium which is identified in the policy and recorded as unearned premium on the inception date of the contract 
this premium will typically adjust only if the underlying insured values adjust 
we actively monitor underlying insured values and record adjustment premiums in the period in which amounts are reasonably determinable 
judgments and uncertainties for business written on a facultative basis  although a premium estimate is not contractually stated for the amount of business to be written under any particular facility  an initial estimate of the expected premium written is received from the coverholder via the broker 
our estimate of premium is derived by reference to one or more of the following the historical premium volume experienced by any facility  historical premium volume of similar facilities  the estimates provided by the broker  and industry information on the underlying business 
we actively monitor the development of actual reported premium against the estimates made  where actual reported premiums deviate from the estimate  we carry out an analysis to determine the cause and may  if necessary  adjust the estimated premiums 
in the year ended december   premiums written on a facultative basis accounted for approximately million of total gross premiums written at talbot 
for contracts written on a losses occurring basis or claims made basis  premium income is generally earned proportionately over the expected risk period  usually months 
for all other contracts  comprising contracts written on a risks attaching basis  premiums are generally earned over a month period due to the fact that some of the underlying exposures may attach towards the end of the contract  and such underlying exposures generally have a month coverage period 
the portion of the premium

year ended december  a year ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands gross written premiums gross written premiums gross written premiums gross written premiums gross written premiums gross written premiums proportional non proportional total a the results of operations for flagstone are consolidated only from the november  date of acquisition 
for reinsurance business where the assumed reinsurance premium is written on an excess of loss or on a pro rata basis  reinsurance contracts are generally written prior to the time the underlying direct policies are written by cedants and accordingly cedants must estimate such premiums when purchasing reinsurance coverage 
for excess of loss contracts  the deposit premium is defined in the contract 
the deposit premium is based on the client s estimated premiums  and this estimate is the amount recorded as written premium in the period the risk incepts 
in the majority of cases  these contracts are adjustable at the end of the contract period to reflect the changes in underlying risks during the contract period 
subsequent adjustments  based on reports by the clients of actual premium  are recorded in the period in which the cedant reports are received  which would normally be reported within six months to one year subsequent to the expiration of the contract 
for pro rata reinsurance contracts  an estimate of written premium is recorded in the period in which the risk incepts 
the written premiums estimate is based on the pro rata cession percentage  on information provided by ceding companies and on management s judgment 
management critically evaluates the information provided by ceding companies based on experience with the cedant  broker and the underlying book of business 
throughout the term of the policy  periodic review of the estimated premium takes place based on the latest information available  which may include actual reported premium to date  the latest premium estimates as provided by cedants and brokers  historical experience  management s professional judgment  information obtained during the underwriting renewal process  as well as an assessment of relevant economic conditions 
if necessary  subsequent adjustments are recorded at the time of review 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the appropriateness of these premium estimates based on the latest information available  which may include actual reported premium to date  the latest premium estimates as provided by cedants and brokers  historical experience  management s professional judgment  information obtained during the underwriting renewal process  as well as an assessment of relevant economic conditions 
past experience may not be indicative of how future premium estimates develop 
the company believes that reasonably likely changes in assumptions made in the estimation process would not have a significant impact on gross premiums written as recorded 
where contract terms on excess of loss contracts require the mandatory reinstatement of coverage after a client s loss  the mandatory reinstatement premiums are recorded as written and earned premiums when the loss event occurs 
management includes an assessment of the creditworthiness of cedants in the review process above  primarily based on market knowledge  reports from rating agencies  the timeliness of cedants payments and the status of current balances owing 
based on this assessment  management believes that as at december  no provision for doubtful accounts is necessary for receivables from cedants 
reinsurance premiums ceded and reinsurance recoverables description as discussed in item business underwriting risk management  the company primarily uses ceded reinsurance for risk mitigation purposes 
talbot purchases reinsurance on an excess of loss and a proportional basis together with a relatively small amount of facultative reinsurance and ilws 
validus re purchases reinsurance on an excess of loss and a proportional basis together with ilw coverage 
judgments and uncertainties for excess of loss business  the amount of premium payable is usually contractually documented at inception and management judgment is only necessary in respect of any loss related elements of the premium  for example reinstatement or adjustment premiums  and loss related commissions 
the full premium is recorded at inception and if the contract is purchased on a losses occurring basis  the premium is earned on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
if the policy is purchased on a risks attaching basis  the premium is earned in line with the inwards gross premiums to which the risk attaching relates 
after the contract has expired  a no claims bonus may be received for certain policies  and this is recorded as a reinsurance premium adjustment in the period in which it can be reasonably determined 

table of contents reinsurance receivable and reinsurance recoverable balances include amounts owed to us in respect of paid and unpaid ceded losses and loss expenses  respectively 
the balances are presented net of a reserve for non recoverability 
as at december   reinsurance recoverable balances were million and paid losses recoverable balances were million 
in establishing our reinsurance recoverable balances  significant judgment is exercised by management in determining the amount of unpaid losses and loss expenses to be ceded as well as our ability to cede losses and loss expenses under our reinsurance contracts 
our ceded unpaid losses and loss expense consists of two elements  those for reported losses and those for losses incurred but not reported ibnr 
ceded amounts for ibnr are developed as part of our loss reserving process 
consequently  the estimation of ceded unpaid losses and loss expenses is subject to similar risks and uncertainties in the estimation of gross ibnr see reserve for losses and loss expenses above 
as at december   ceded ibnr recoverable balances were million 
although our reinsurance receivable and reinsurance recoverable balances are derived from our determination of contractual provisions  the recoverability of such amounts may ultimately differ due to the potential for a reinsurer to become financially impaired or insolvent or for a contractual dispute over contract language or coverage 
consequently  we review our reinsurance recoverable balances on a regular basis to determine if there is a need to establish a provision for non recoverability 
in performing this review  we use judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of our reinsurers and the contractual provisions of our reinsurance agreements 
as at december   we had a provision for non recoverability of million 
in the event that the credit worthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our provision for non recoverability 
the company uses a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance 
the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurer s balance deemed to be uncollectible 
default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions at december   the use of different assumptions within the model could have an effect on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
to the extent the creditworthiness of the company s reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry  such as a large number of major catastrophes  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than the company s provision 
investment valuation description consistent with us gaap  the company recognizes fixed maturity and short term investments at their fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
us gaap also established a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy is based upon whether the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability are observable or unobservable in the market at the measurement date  with quoted market prices being the highest level level and unobservable inputs being the lowest level level 
generally  the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments inversely correlates with the availability of observable inputs 
all of the company s fixed maturity and short term investment fair value measurements have either quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
judgments and uncertainties the company s external investment accounting service provider receives prices from independent pricing sources to measure the fair values of its fixed maturity investments 
these independent pricing sources are prioritized with respect to reliability to ensure that only the highest priority pricing inputs are used 
the independent pricing sources are received via automated feeds from indices  pricing and broker dealers services 
pricing is also obtained from other external investment managers 
this information is applied consistently across all portfolios 
the company s external investment accounting service provider confirms and documents all prices received from broker dealers on a daily basis for quality control and audit purposes 
in addition to internal controls  management relies on the effectiveness of the valuation controls in place at the company s external investment accounting service provider supported by a ssae report in conjunction with regular discussion and analysis of the investment portfolio s structure and performance 
to date  management has not noted any issues or discrepancies related to investment valuation 
other investments consist of hedge funds  a fund of hedge funds  private equity investments and a deferred compensation trust held in mutual funds 
the hedge funds were valued at million at december  the hedge funds consist of an investment in four paulson co 
managed funds and three investment funds assumed from the flagstone acquisition 
the paulson co 
inc funds administrator provides monthly reported net asset values navs with a one month delay in its valuation 
as a result  the funds administrator november  nav was used as a partial basis for fair value measurement in the 
table of contents company december  balance sheet 
the fund manager provides an estimate of the nav at december  based on estimated performance 
the company adjusts fair value to the fund manager estimated nav that incorporates relevant valuation sources on a timely basis 
as this valuation technique incorporates both observable and significant unobservable inputs  the paulson hedge funds are classified as level assets 
to determine the reasonableness of the estimated nav  the company assesses the variance between the fund manager estimated nav and the fund administrator nav 
material variances are recorded in the current reporting period while immaterial variances are recorded in the following reporting period 
these managed hedge funds are subject to quarterly liquidity 
the flagstone investment funds and private equity investments monthly reported nav is provided with a one month or one quarter delay in its valuation 
as a result  the november  nav or the september  nav was used as a basis for fair value measurement in the company december  balance sheet 
as this valuation technique incorporates both observable and significant unobservable inputs  the investments funds and private equity investments are classified as level assets 
the fund of hedge funds includes a side pocket valued at million at december  while a redemption request has been submitted  the timing of receipt of proceeds on the side pocket is unknown 
the fund administrator provides a monthly reported nav with a one month delay in its valuation 
as a result  the fund administrator november  nav was used as a basis for fair value measurement in the company december  balance sheet 
the fund manager provides an estimate of the fund nav at december  based on the estimated performance provided from the underlying third party funds 
to determine the reasonableness of the nav  the company compares the one month delayed fund administrator nav to the fund manager estimated nav that incorporates relevant valuation sources on a timely basis 
material variances are recorded in the current reporting period while immaterial variances are recorded in the following reporting period 
as this valuation technique incorporates both observable and significant unobservable inputs  the fund of hedge funds is classified as a level asset

the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are also often measured by reference to its underwriting income  which is a non gaap financial measure 
underwriting income  as set out in the table below  is reconciled to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by the addition or subtraction of certain consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss line items  as illustrated below

underwriting income indicates the performance of the company s core underwriting function  excluding revenues and expenses such as the reconciling items in the table above 
the company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the company s core insurance and reinsurance business 
underwriting profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth  adequacy of the company s pricing and loss frequency and severity 
underwriting profitability over time is also influenced by the company s underwriting discipline  which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification  its management of claims  its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio  which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
the company believes that underwriting income provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability derived from underwriting activities 
the company excludes the us gaap measures noted above  in particular net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments  from its calculation of underwriting income because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by  and fluctuates in part  according to availability of investment market opportunities 
the company believes these amounts are largely independent of its underwriting business and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations 
in addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with us gaap  the company believes that showing underwriting income enables investors  analysts  rating agencies and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the company s results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes the company s underlying business performance 
the company uses underwriting income as a primary measure of underwriting results in its analysis of historical financial information and when performing its budgeting and forecasting processes 
analysts  investors and rating agencies who follow the company 
table of contents request this non gaap financial information on a regular basis 
in addition  underwriting income is one of the factors considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in determining the total annual incentive compensation 
underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income as there are inherent material limitations associated with the use of underwriting income as compared to using net income  which is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure 
the most significant limitation is the ability of users of the financial information to make comparable assessments of underwriting income with other companies  particularly as underwriting income may be defined or calculated differently by other companies 
therefore  the company provides more prominence in this filing to the use of the most comparable us gaap financial measure  net income  which includes the reconciling items in the table above 
the company compensates for these limitations by providing both clear and transparent disclosure of net income and reconciliation of underwriting income to net income

management of insurance and reinsurance companies use significant judgment in the estimation of reserves for losses and loss expenses 
given the magnitude of recent loss events and other uncertainties inherent in loss estimation  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding the estimation for recent notable loss events 
the company actual ultimate net loss may vary materially from these estimates 
ultimate losses for notable loss events are estimated through detailed review of contracts which are identified by the company as potentially exposed to the specific notable loss event 
however  there can be no assurance that the ultimate loss amount estimated for a specific contract will be accurate  or that all contracts with exposure to a specific notable loss event will be identified in a timely manner 
potential losses in excess of the estimated ultimate loss assigned to a contract on the basis of a specific review  or loss amounts from contracts not specifically included in the detailed review are reserved for in the reserve for potential development on notable loss events

the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are also often measured by reference to its underwriting income  which is a non gaap measure as previously defined 
underwriting income  as set out in the table below  is reconciled to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by the addition or subtraction of net investment income  other income  finance expenses  gain on bargain purchase  realized gain on repurchase of debentures  net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments  foreign exchange gains losses and transaction expenses  as illustrated below

underwriting income indicates the performance of the company s core underwriting function  excluding revenues and expenses such as the reconciling items in the table above 
the company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the company s core insurance and reinsurance business 
underwriting profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth  adequacy of the company s pricing and loss frequency and severity 
underwriting profitability over time is also influenced by the company s underwriting discipline  which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification  its management of claims  its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio  which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
the company believes that underwriting income provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability derived from underwriting activities 
the company excludes the us gaap measures noted above  in particular net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments  from its calculation of underwriting income because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by  and fluctuates in part  according to availability of investment market opportunities 
the company believes these amounts are largely independent of its underwriting business and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations 
in addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with us gaap  the company believes that showing underwriting income 
table of contents enables investors  analysts  rating agencies and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the company s results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes the company s underlying business performance 
the company uses underwriting income as a primary measure of underwriting results in its analysis of historical financial information and when performing its budgeting and forecasting processes 
analysts  investors and rating agencies who follow the company request this non gaap financial information on a regular basis 
in addition  underwriting income is one of the factors considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in determining total annual incentive compensation 
underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income as there are inherent material limitations associated with the use of underwriting income as compared to using net income  which is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure 
the most significant limitation is the ability of users of the financial information to make comparable assessments of underwriting income with other companies  particularly as underwriting income may be defined or calculated differently by other companies 
therefore  the company provides more prominence in this filing to the use of the most comparable us gaap financial measure  net income  which includes the reconciling items in the table above 
the company compensates for these limitations by providing both clear and transparent disclosure of net income and reconciliation of underwriting income to net income 
net investment income net investment income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
net investment income decreased due to falling yields on fixed maturity investments
