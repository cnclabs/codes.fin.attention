see use of non gaap financial measures below for a reconciliation of non gaap based measures to gaap based measures 
acquisitions our competitive position in the marketplace requires us to maintain a complex and evolving array of technologies  products  services and capabilities 
in light of the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate  we regularly evaluate various acquisition opportunities within the eim market 
we made three acquisitions during fiscal on may   we acquired iccm professional services limited iccm  a provider of it service management software solutions  based in malmesbury  united kingdom  for million 
on march   we acquired resonate kt limited rkt  a company based in cardiff  united kingdom  for million 
rkt is a leading provider of software that enables organizations to visualize unstructured data  create new user experiences for ecm and xecm for sap  as well as build industry based applications that maximize unstructured data residing within content server  a key component of the opentext ecm suite 
on july   we acquired easylink services international corporation easylink  a company based in georgia  usa and a global provider of cloud based electronic messaging and business integration services for million 
we believe our acquisitions support our long term strategic direction  strengthen our competitive position  expand our customer base  provide greater scale to accelerate innovation  grow our earnings and increase shareholder value 
we expect to continue to strategically acquire companies  products  services and technologies to augment our existing business 
see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements for more details 
outlook for fiscal we believe we have a strong position in the eim market 
our goal is to build on our leadership in ecm  bpm  cem  and ix and to expand our position in discovery  while continuing to expand our leadership in eim 
we continue to have approximately of our revenues from customer support revenues  which are generally a recurring source of income  and we expect this trend will continue 
also  in fiscal we recognized cloud services revenue and we expect this service to be an important growth driver in the future 
we also believe that our diversified geographic profile helps strengthen our position and helps to reduce our impact from a downturn in the economy that may occur in any one specific region 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following i revenue recognition  ii goodwill  iii acquired intangibles  iv restructuring charges  v business combinations  vi foreign currency  and vii income taxes 
revenue recognition license revenues we recognize revenues in accordance with asc topic  software revenue recognition topic 
we record product revenues from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance by the customer  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenues related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 
our multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and our significant pcs renewal experience  from our existing worldwide base 
our multiple element sales arrangements generally include irrevocable rights for the customer to renew pcs after the bundled term ends 
the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty for failure to renew 
further  the renewal pcs options are for services comparable to the bundled pcs and cover similar terms 
it is our experience that customers generally exercise their renewal pcs option 
in the renewal transaction  pcs is sold on a stand alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement 
the exercised renewal pcs price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement  although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes is not uncommon 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenues are deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we assess whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring 
our sales arrangements generally include standard payment terms 
these terms effectively relate to all customers  products  and arrangements regardless of customer type  product mix or arrangement size 
exceptions are only made to these standard terms for certain sales in parts of the world where local practice differs 
in these jurisdictions  our customary payment terms are in line with local practice 
cloud revenues cloud revenues consist of subscription revenues for our software as a service offering 
the majority of the contracts for our software as a service offering are based on customers usage over a period and the revenue associated with those contracts are recognized once the usage has been measured  the fee fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
some of the contracts for our software as a service offering have an established fixed periodic fee and the revenue associated with those contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
the majority of our hosting services contracts have an established fixed periodic fee and the revenue associated with those are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
service revenues service revenues consist of revenues from consulting  implementation  training and integration services 
these services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services 
for those contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction  we determine vsoe of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
these consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are  on average  less than six months in length 
revenues from these services are recognized at the time such services are rendered 
we also enter into contracts that are primarily fixed fee arrangements wherein the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element 
in such cases  the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenues 
revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which these services are performed 
customer support revenues customer support revenues consist of revenues derived from contracts to provide pcs to license holders 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advance billings of pcs are not recorded to the extent that the term of the pcs has not commenced and payment has not been received 
deferred revenues deferred revenues primarily relate to support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services 
generally  the services will be provided in the twelve months after the signing of the agreement 
long term sales contracts we entered into certain long term sales contracts involving the sale of integrated solutions that include the modification and customization of software and the provision of services that are essential to the functionality of the other elements in this arrangement 
as prescribed by asc topic  we recognize revenues from such arrangements in accordance with the contract accounting guidelines in asc topic  construction type and production type contracts topic  after evaluating for separation of any non topic elements in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  multiple element arrangements topic 
when circumstances exist that allow us to make reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenues  contract costs and the progress of the contract to completion  we account for sales under such long term contracts using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
under the poc method  progress towards completion of the contract is measured based upon either input measures or output measures 
we measure progress towards completion based upon an input measure and calculate this as the proportion of the actual hours incurred compared to the total estimated hours 
for training and integration services rendered under such contracts  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
we will review  on a quarterly basis  the total estimated remaining costs to completion for each of these contracts and apply the impact of any changes on the poc prospectively 
if at any time we anticipate that the estimated remaining costs to completion will exceed the value of the contract  the resulting loss will be recognized immediately 
when circumstances exist that prevent us from making reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenues  we account for sales under such long term contracts using the completed contract method 
sales to resellers and channel partners we execute certain sales contracts through resellers and distributors collectively  resellers and also large  well capitalized partners such as sap ag and accenture inc collectively  channel partners 
we recognize revenues relating to sales through resellers when all the recognition criteria have been met  in other words  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred in the reporting period  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
typically  we recognize revenues to resellers only after the reseller communicates the occurrence of end user sales to us  since we do not have privity of contract with the end user 
in addition we assess the creditworthiness of each reseller and if the reseller is newly formed  undercapitalized or in financial difficulty any revenues expected to emanate from such resellers are deferred and recognized only when cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenues relating to sales through channel partners in the reporting period in which we receive evidence  from the channel partner  of end user sales collectively  the documentation and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as a result  if the documentation is not received within a given reporting period we recognize the revenues in a period subsequent to the period in which the channel partner completes the sale to the end user 
rights of return and other incentives we do not generally offer rights of return or any other incentives such as concessions  product rotation  or price protection and  therefore  do not provide for or make estimates of rights of return and similar incentives 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment at a minimum annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable 
our operations are analyzed by management and our chief operating decision maker codm as being part of a single industry segment the design  development  marketing and sales of enterprise information management software and solutions 
therefore  our goodwill impairment assessment is based on the allocation of goodwill to a single reporting unit 
effective fiscal  we opted to perform a qualitative assessment to test our reporting unit goodwill for impairment 
based on our qualitative assessment  if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than percent to be less than its carrying amount  the two step impairment test will be performed 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting unit goodwill 
if the carrying value our reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
our annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of april  our qualitative assessment indicated that there were no indications of impairment and the fair value of our reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value and therefore there was no impairment of goodwill required to be recorded for fiscal no impairments were recorded for fiscal and fiscal 
acquired intangibles acquired intangibles consist of acquired technology and customer relationships associated with various acquisitions 
acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income producing capabilities of software products acquired on acquisitions 
we amortize acquired technology over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer relationships represent relationships that we have with customers of the acquired companies and are either based upon contractual or legal rights or are considered separable  that is  capable of being separated from the acquired entity and being sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
these customer relationships are initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
we amortize customer relationships on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate the remaining estimated useful life of our intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
restructuring charges we record restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations and other exit costs in accordance with asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations asc topic 
asc topic requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
in order to incur a liability pursuant to asc topic  our management must have established and approved a plan of restructuring in sufficient detail 
a liability for a cost associated with involuntary termination benefits is recorded when benefits have been communicated and a liability for a cost to terminate an operating lease or other contract is incurred when the contract has been terminated in accordance with the contract terms or we have ceased using the right conveyed by the contract  such as vacating a leased facility 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires us to make certain judgments regarding the nature  timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities  including estimating sub lease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances see note special charges to our consolidated financial statements for more details 
business combinations we apply the provisions of asc topic  business combinations topic  in the accounting for our acquisitions 
it requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration  where applicable  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as one time termination and exit costs pursuant to asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations topic and are accounted for separately from the business combination 
for a given acquisition  we generally identify certain pre acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation and  if so  to determine the estimated amounts 
if we determine that a pre acquisition contingency non income tax related is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date  we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary purchase price allocation 
we often continue to gather information and evaluate our pre acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre acquisition contingencies during the measurement period  such amounts will be included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and  subsequently  in our results of operations 
uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date 
we review these items during the measurement period as we continue to actively seek and collect information relating to facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date 
changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances made subsequent to the measurement period  or if they relate to facts and circumstances that did not exist at the acquisition date  are recorded in our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of income 
foreign currency our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
in general  the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the local currency 
for each subsidiary  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into u 
s dollars at the exchange rates in effect at balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the month of the transaction 
the effect of foreign currency translation adjustments not affecting net income are included in shareholders equity under the cumulative translation adjustment account as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
transactional foreign currency gains losses included in the consolidated statements of income under the line item other income expense for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes topic 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
these temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
we account for our uncertain tax provisions by using a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not  based solely on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize 
the amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized 
the tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
on subsequent recognition and measurement the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the company best estimate  given the information available at the reporting date  although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final 
upon adopting the revisions in asc topic  we elected to follow an accounting policy to classify accrued interest related to liabilities for income taxes within the interest expense line and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the other expense line of our consolidated statements of income  however  in fiscal we changed this policy to recognize both items within the provision for recovery of income taxes line of our consolidated statements of income see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for more details

additionally  the decrease in license revenues was attributable to a lower number of deals greater than million that closed during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year deals in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
cost of license revenues decreased by million  primarily due to lower license revenue attainment as well as lower third party technology costs

additionally  license revenue was favourably influenced by the impact of acquisitions 
cost of license revenues decreased slightly by million 
the decrease in costs was primarily due to lower third party technology costs 
overall gross margin percentage on cost of license revenues remained relatively stable 
cloud services cloud services revenues consist of services arrangements primarily attributable to our acquisition of easylink 
these arrangements allow our customers to make use of legacy easylink and opentext software  services and content over internet enabled networks supported by opentext data centers 
these web applications allow customers to transmit a variety of content between various mediums and to securely manage enterprise information without the commitment of investing in related hardware infrastructure 
revenues are generated on several transactional usage based models  are typically billed monthly in arrears  and can therefore fluctuate from period to period 
certain service fees are occasionally charged to customize hosted software for some customers and are either amortized over the expected economic life of the contract  in the case of setup fees  or recognized in the period they are provided 
cost of cloud services revenues is comprised primarily of third party network usage fees  maintenance of in house data hardware centers  technical support personnel related costs and some third party royalty costs

no prior period comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation since such prior period amounts were not material 
customer support revenues customer support revenues consist of revenues from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
therefore  changes in customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period 
the terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months  with customer renewal options

overall we saw that recent acquisitions had favourably influenced revenue growth across all geographic regions 
cost of customer support revenues increased by million 
the increase in costs was primarily due to higher direct costs incurred as a result of increased customer support revenues  as well as an increase in the installed base of third party products 
overall gross margin percentage on customer support revenues remained relatively stable 
professional service and other revenues professional service and other revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide implementation  training and integration services professional services 
other revenues consist of hardware revenues 
these revenues are grouped within the professional service and other category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues 
professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses 
cost of professional service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration  configuration and training with respect to our various software products 
the most significant components of these costs are personnel related expenses  travel costs and third party subcontracting

cost of professional service and other revenues decreased by million 
this is primarily due to lower professional service and other revenues as well as the reduction in the use of subcontractors 
as a result of efficiencies achieved and improved utilization  we have experienced increased margins in professional services during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal professional service and other revenues increased by million which was geographically attributable to an increase in americas of million  an increase in emea of million and an increase in asia pacific of million 
overall we saw that recent acquisitions had favourably influenced revenue growth across all geographic regions 
cost of professional service and other revenues increased by million  primarily as a result of an increase in direct labour and other labour related costs associated with an increase in service and other revenues

year over year change between fiscal in thousands and and payroll and payroll related benefits contract labour and consulting share based compensation travel and communication facilities other miscellaneous total year over year change in research and development expenses fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses decreased by million  primarily due to a decrease in fees related to contract labour and consulting services of million as we reduced the usage of external services and replaced them with internal resources 
correspondingly  the change in contract labour resources resulted in a million decrease in the use of facilities and facility related resources as well as a decrease in travel and communication expenses of million as steps were taken to further reduce costs 
overall  our research and development expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  have decreased to approximately 
fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased by million  primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related benefits of million 
these increases were driven largely by the additional headcount we acquired as a result of acquisitions 
facility costs increased correspondingly  partially as a result of the increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities  and also due to increased operational spending

these increases were driven by an initiative to increase sales force capacity and to increase marketing spend to leverage future sales growth 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in commission benefits resulting from lower license revenues 
overall  our sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  have decreased slightly to approximately 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased by million  primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related benefits of million and an increase in commissions of million 
these increases were driven largely by the additional headcount we incurred as a result of acquisitions and as a result of increased hiring we did as we continue to expand and grow our business globally

special charges special charges typically relate to amounts that we expect to pay in connection with restructuring plans relating to employee workforce reduction and abandonment of excess facilities  acquisition related costs and other similar charges 
generally  we implement such plans in the context of integrating existing opentext operations with that of acquired entities 
actions related to such restructuring plans are typically completed within a period of one year

provision for income taxes we initiated an internal reorganization of our international subsidiaries in fiscal and we continue to integrate acquisitions into this new organizational structure for the following reasons to consolidate our intellectual property within certain jurisdictions  to effect an operational reduction of our global subsidiaries with a view to  eventually  having a single operating legal entity in each jurisdiction  to better safeguard our intellectual property in jurisdictions with well established legal regimes and protections and to simplify the management of our intellectual property ownership 
we operate in several tax jurisdictions and are exposed to various foreign tax rates 
we also note that we are subject to tax rate discrepancies between our domestic tax rate and foreign tax rates that are significant and these discrepancies are primarily related to earnings in luxembourg

global and a canadian election to file tax returns in us dollar functional currency 
the fiscal tax expense also includes an increase in tax expense related to the impact of adjustments in the united states and australia upon filing of tax returns  which is offset by tax benefits achieved on account of tax years becoming statute barred for purposes of uncertain tax positions  as well as a decrease in the impact of valuation allowances 
the remainder of the differences are due to normal course movements and non material items 
fiscal compared to fiscal the effective gaap tax rate which is the provision for taxes expressed as a percentage of net income before taxes has remained relatively stable at for fiscal compared to for fiscal the slight decrease in the fiscal effective tax rate is due to tax benefits relating to the internal reorganization of the recently acquired international subsidiaries of metastorm inc and global  the impact of foreign tax rate differences and a canadian election to file tax returns in us dollar functional currency accepted in fiscal use of non gaap financial measures in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with us gaap  the company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with us gaap non gaap 
these non gaap financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the company definition may be different from similar non gaap financial measures used by other companies and or analysts and may differ from period to period 
thus it may be more difficult to compare the company financial performance to that of other companies 
however  the company management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these non gaap financial measures both in its reconciliation to the us gaap financial measures and its consolidated financial statements  all of which should be considered when evaluating the company results 
the company uses these non gaap financial measures to supplement the information provided in its consolidated financial statements  which are presented in accordance with us gaap 
the presentation of non gaap financial measures are not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap  but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such us gaap measures 
opentext strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
the company therefore believes that despite these limitations  it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the us gaap measures with certain non gaap measures defined below 
non gaap based net income and non gaap based eps are calculated as net income or net income per share on a diluted basis  excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets  other income expense  share based compensation  and special charges  all net of tax 
non gaap based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of gaap based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology based intangible assets 
non gaap based gross margin is calculated as non gaap based gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue 
non gaap based income from operations is calculated as income from operations  excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets  special charges  and share based compensation expense 
non gaap based operating margin is calculated as non gaap based income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 
the company management believes that the presentation of the above defined non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the company before the impact of certain non operational charges 
the use of the term non operational charge is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the company management and is based upon the way the company management evaluates the performance of the company business for use in the company internal reports 
in the course of such evaluation and for the purpose of making operating decisions  the company management excludes certain items from its analysis  including amortization of acquired intangible assets  special charges  share based compensation  other income expense  and the taxation impact of these items 
these items are excluded based upon the manner in which management evaluates the business of the company and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under us gaap 
the company believes the provision of supplemental non gaap measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the company core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses  and is therefore a useful indication of opentext performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period to period comparison of operating performance 
as a result  the company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide  in addition to us gaap measures  supplementary non gaap financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results

this was the result of an increase in acquisition related spending of million  partially offset by a million decrease in additions of property and equipment

litigation j litigation j global  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary advanced messaging technologies  inc collectively j had filed several patent infringement lawsuits alleging that opentext and its subsidiaries and predecessors in interest  captaris  inc captaris and easylink services international corporation and xpedite services llc collectively easylink  were infringing us patent nos 
    and  by offering fax related products 
j had sought injunctions  royalties and damages in this matter 
through the recent acquisition of easylink  opentext inherited complete carriage of the defense of these cases  which were pending in the united states district court for the central district of california 
in each of the cases  opentext and its subsidiaries or predecessors in interest had asserted defenses and counterclaims contending that the patents are invalid and not infringed 
opentext and j entered  on april   into a settlement in relation to these disputes  the terms of which include a one time fee payable by opentext to j of million million net of taxation impacts to opentext  and dismissal of all the lawsuits between the parties with prejudice 
the settlement in the amount of million was paid by us to j in the fourth quarter of fiscal other litigation we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of asc topic loss contingencies asc topic 
specifically  this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items  discussing the nature of any litigation and claim  including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation  with relevant internal and external counsel  and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with asc topic as of the date of this filing on form k for the year ended june   we do not believe that the outcomes of any of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized 
contingencies easylink is currently being assessed by the new york state department of taxation and finance the department for the potential applicability of telecommunications excise and franchise taxes to its new york state revenues for the calendar year ended december  through to calendar year ended december  the potential exposure under this assessment  based upon the notice issued by the department  is approximately million

on june  we were advised by new york state that the motion for leave to appeal was denied 
new york state sales tax audits are also currently underway for subsequent periods from june through to february we intend to vigorously contest any future assessments based on facts and circumstances relating to business operations during this timeframe 
however  we believe we have established sufficient reserves for this matter 
the results of these audits for subsequent periods  and the potential sales tax exposure for easylink  could be significantly influenced by the outcome of the above referenced sales tax decision 
opentext intends to vigorously defend against these claims 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not enter into off balance sheet financing as a matter of practice except for the use of operating leases for office space  computer equipment  and vehicles

at june   an adverse change in libor of basis points would have had the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the term loan by approximately million  assuming that the loan balance was outstanding for the entire period 
foreign currency risk foreign currency transaction risk we transact business in various foreign currencies 
our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany fees  intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term 
we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency transactions that we enter into  the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates 
additionally  we have hedged certain of our canadian dollar foreign currency exposures relating to our payroll expenses in canada 
based on the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as at june   a one cent change in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates would cause a change of approximately million in the mark to market on our existing foreign exchange forward contracts 
at june   a one cent change in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates would cause a change of approximately million in the mark to market on our existing foreign exchange forward contracts 
foreign currency translation risk our reporting currency is the us dollar 
fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into us dollars 
in particular  the amount of cash and cash equivalents that we report in us dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet
