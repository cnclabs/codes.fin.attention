table of contents part i item business pinnacle west pinnacle west is a holding company that conducts business through its subsidiaries 
we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly owned subsidiary  aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area  the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 
pinnacle west s other remaining first tier subsidiaries are suncor and el dorado 
additional information related to these businesses is provided later in this report 
our reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment  which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities  and includes electricity generation  transmission and distribution 
business of arizona public service company aps currently provides electric service to approximately million customers 
we own or lease approximately  mw of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both long term and short term purchased power agreements for additional capacity  including a variety of agreements for the purchase of renewable energy 
during  no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than of our electric revenues

aps operates the plant and owns of four corners units  and and of units and aps has a total entitlement from four corners of mw 
on november   aps and sce entered into an asset purchase agreement the asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps of sce s interest in each of units and of four corners 
if consummated  aps would acquire mw from sce 
the purchase price is million  subject to certain adjustments 
completion of the purchase by aps is subject to the receipt of approvals by the acc  the cpuc and the ferc 
on march   the cpuc issued an order approving the sale 
on april   the acc voted to allow aps to move forward with the purchase 
the asset purchase agreement provides that the purchase price will be reduced by million for each month between october  and the closing date 
the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the transaction for cost recovery purposes in a future proceeding if the purchase closes 
the acc also authorized an accounting deferral of certain costs associated with the purchase until any such cost recovery proceeding concludes 
the ferc application seeking authorization for the transaction was approved on november  the principal remaining condition to closing is the negotiation and execution of a new coal supply contract for four corners on terms reasonably acceptable to aps 

table of contents on december   bhp billiton  the parent company of bncc  the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners  announced that it has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the navajo nation setting out the key terms under which full ownership of bncc would be sold to the navajo nation 
bhp billiton would be retained by bncc under contract as the mine manager and operator until july key terms of the new coal supply contract are being finalized by the navajo nation and aps and the other four corners co owners 
as a result of this proposed change in ownership of bncc  aps now expects that a new coal supply contract would be executed upon completion of negotiations and following the endorsement of the transfer of ownership of the stock of bncc to a new navajo nation commercial enterprise to be established by the navajo nation tribal council 
the decision of the tribal council is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  either aps or sce has a right to terminate the agreement if satisfaction of the closing conditions had not occurred by december   unless the party seeking to terminate is then in breach of the agreement 
the four corners plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government 
aps  on behalf of the four corners participants  negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from to the navajo nation approved these amendments in march the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi  as does a related federal rights of way grant  which the four corners participants will pursue 
a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process 
aps has announced that  if aps s purchase of sce s interests in units and at four corners is consummated  it will close units  and at the plant 
these events would change the plant s overall generating capacity from  mw to  mw and aps s entitlement from the plant from mw to mw 
aps cannot predict whether the mutual right to terminate in the asset purchase agreement will be exercised by a party to that agreement in the future  whether bhp billiton and the navajo nation will consummate the transfer of ownership of bncc  or whether the coal supply contract will be finalized and executed  such that closing of aps s purchase of sce s interest in four corners can occur

palo verde leases in  aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back about of its share of palo verde unit and certain common facilities 
in accordance with the vie accounting guidance  aps consolidates the lessor trust entities for financial reporting purposes  and eliminates lease accounting for these transactions 
the agreements have terms of years expiring at the end of and contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms 
aps was required to give notice to the respective lessor trusts between december  and december  if it wished to retain the leased assets without specifying whether it would purchase the leased assets or extend the leases or return the leased assets to the lessor trusts 
on december   aps gave notice to the respective lessor trusts informing them it will retain the leased assets 
aps must give notice to the respective lessor trusts by june  notifying them which of the purchase or lease renewal options it will exercise

palo verde operating licenses operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc 
the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit in june  unit in april and unit in november  and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in april  which extended the licenses for units  and to june  april and november  respectively 
palo verde fuel cycle the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs 
the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  enrichment of uranium hexafluoride  fabrication of fuel assemblies  utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors  and storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 

table of contents the palo verde participants have contracted for of palo verde s requirements for uranium concentrates through  of its requirements in and of its requirements in the participants have also contracted for all of palo verde s conversion services through  of its requirements in and of its requirements in  all of palo verde s enrichment services through  and all of palo verde s fuel assembly fabrication services through in late august  one of palo verde s suppliers that converts uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride invoked the force majeure provision in its contract when it shut down its conversion plant due to regulatory compliance issues 
the palo verde participants have sufficient strategic reserves of enriched uranium such that they do not anticipate a short term impact on nuclear fuel supplies as a result of the force majeure declaration 
the uranium conversion supplier has undertaken the necessary upgrades to its facility to address the regulatory compliance issues and anticipates resuming operations in a time frame that will not result in an adverse impact on palo verde s ability to secure long term conversion services 
however  the participants are continuing to evaluate alternate long term options for securing conversion services 
spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa required the doe to accept  transport  and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation s nuclear power plants by the doe s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and or high level radioactive waste standard contract with each nuclear power plant 
the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by  and aps on behalf of itself and the other palo verde participants filed a lawsuit for doe s breach of the palo verde standard contract in the us court of federal claims 
the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and in october awarded million in damages to the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december on december   aps  acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of palo verde  filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the doe 
this lawsuit seeks to recover aps s damages incurred due to doe s failure to accept palo verde s spent nuclear fuel for the period beginning january  through june  the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing  licensing  constructing  and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain  nevada 
in march  the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its yucca mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the nrc 
several interested parties have intervened in the nrc proceeding  and the proceeding has not been conclusively decided by the nrc or the courts 
additionally  a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application 
none of these lawsuits have been conclusively decided by the courts 
on june   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the dc circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the nrc s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel 
the petitioners had challenged the nrc s update to the agency s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule waste confidence decision 
the dc circuit found that the agency s waste confidence decision update constituted a major federal action  which  consistent with the national environmental policy act nepa  requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the 
table of contents agency s actions 
the dc circuit found that the nrc s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient  and therefore remanded the waste confidence decision update for further action consistent with nepa 
on september   the nrc commissioners issued a directive to the nrc staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated waste confidence decision 
the commission also directed the staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within months of september  timely resolution of the remand by the court of appeals could have an adverse impact on certain nrc licensing actions 
palo verde has sufficient capacity at its on site independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period  which ends in december additionally  palo verde has sufficient capacity at its on site isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation  which ends in november if uncertainties regarding the united states government s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved  aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 
nuclear decommissioning costs aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units  and the decommissioning costs of palo verde units  and are currently included in aps s acc jurisdictional rates 
decommissioning costs are recoverable through a non bypassable system benefits charge paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system

impact of earthquake and tsunami in japan on nuclear energy industry on march   an earthquake measuring on the richter scale occurred off the coast of japan 
after the earthquake  the first of a series of seven tsunamis arrived at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station 
as a result  the fukushima daiichi station experienced considerable damage 
following the earthquake and tsunamis  the nrc established a task force the near term task force to conduct a systematic and methodical review of nrc processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to its regulatory system 
on march   the nrc issued the first regulatory requirements based on the recommendations of the near term task force 
with respect to palo verde  the nrc issued two orders requiring safety enhancements regarding mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at plants  and enhancement of spent fuel pool instrumentation 
the nrc has issued a series of interim staff guidance documents regarding implementation of these requirements 
due to the developing nature of these requirements  we cannot predict the financial or operational impacts on palo verde or aps  however  palo verde continues to comply with regulatory requirements and related reporting to the nrc as specified in the march   and interim staff guidance documents

the renewable energy requirement is of retail electric sales in and increases annually until it reaches in in aps s retail rate case settlement agreement  aps committed to have  gwh of new renewable resources in service by year end in addition to its renewable resource commitments 
taken together  aps s commitment is estimated to be approximately of retail sales  by year end  which is more than double the res target of for that year 
a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking  small scale renewable technologies that are located on customers properties  such as rooftop solar systems 
accordingly  under the res  an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources 
this distributed energy requirement is of the overall res requirement of in the following table summarizes the res requirement standard not including the additional commitment required by the settlement agreement discussed above and its timing res as a of retail electric sales percent of res to be supplied from distributed energy resources renewable energy portfolio

demand side management in recent years  arizona regulators have placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy  while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy 
in december  the acc initiated its energy efficiency rulemaking  with a proposed energy efficiency standard of cumulative annual energy savings by this standard was adopted and became effective on january  this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona s future energy resource needs 
see note for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations resulting from the settlement agreement related to aps s retail rate case 
government awards through the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra and other doe initiatives  the federal government made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources  improve reliability and create jobs 
aps has received two awards from the doe 
the first is a million non arra award for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the community power project in flagstaff  arizona 
this award will conclude on march  and is contingent upon aps meeting certain project milestones  including doe established budget parameters

aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor owned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation  as well as cooperatives  municipalities  electrical districts and similar types of governmental or non profit organizations 
in addition  some customers  particularly industrial and large commercial customers  may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements 
this practice is becoming more 
table of contents popular with customers installing or having installed products such as roof top solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 
on april   the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for non profit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not public service corporations under the arizona constitution  and are therefore not regulated by the acc 
a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model 
use of such products by customers within our territory would result in an increasing level of competition 
aps cannot predict when  and the extent to which  additional electric service providers will enter or re enter aps s service territory 
in  the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona 
as a result  as of january   all of aps s retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers 
however  there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps s customers 
in  the arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful  the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds  and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona 
in  the arizona court of appeals invalidated some  but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers 
in  the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision 
to date  the acc has taken no further or substantive action on either the rules or the prior orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision 
in  the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals decision referenced above 
the acc staff s report on the results of its investigation was issued on august  the report stated that additional analysis  discussion and study of all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation 
while the report did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops  the report did state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of modification 
several acc commissioners have publicly expressed interest in re examining retail electric competition in aps cannot predict if or when this re examination might occur

table of contents environmental matters climate change legislative initiatives 
there have been no recent attempts by congress to pass legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas ghg emissions and  with its focus on other issues  such as economic recovery and job growth  it is unclear if and when the th congress will consider a climate change bill 
in the event climate change legislation ultimately passes  the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors  none of which can be fully known until a law is enacted and the specifics of the resulting program are established 
these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed emissions  whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned  the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace  and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance 
in addition to federal legislative initiatives  state specific initiatives may also impact our business 
while arizona has no pending legislation and no proposed agency rule regulating ghgs in arizona  the california legislature enacted ab and sb in to address ghg emissions 
in october  the california air resources board approved final regulations that established a state wide cap on ghg emissions beginning on january  and established a ghg allowance trading program under that cap 
the first phase of the program  which applies to  among other entities  importers of electricity  commenced on january  under the program  importers of electricity  including aps  must hold carbon allowances to cover ghg emissions associated with electricity imported into california from outside the state 
aps is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the psa 
we are monitoring arizona regulatory activities and other state legislative developments to understand the extent to which they may affect our business  including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of our out of state power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coal fired power plants 
in particular  sce  a participant in four corners  has indicated that sb may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant 
see energy sources and resource planning generation facilities coal fueled generating facilities four corners above for details of the pending sale of sce s interest in four corners to aps 
regulatory initiatives 
in december  epa determined that ghg emissions endanger public health and welfare 
this determination was made in response to a united states supreme court ruling that ghgs fit within the clean air act s broad definition of air pollutant and  as a result  epa has the authority to regulate ghg emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act 
as a result of this endangerment finding  epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major ghg emitting sources  including power plants 
on june   epa issued a rule under the clean air act  known as the tailoring rule  establishing new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when sources  including power plants  must obtain air operating permits or new source review permits 
new source review  or nsr  is a pre construction permitting program under the clean air act that requires analysis of pollution controls prior to building a new stationary source or making major modifications to an existing stationary source 
the tailoring rule became effective on august  and it became applicable to power plants on january  several groups filed lawsuits challenging epa s endangerment finding and the tailoring rule  but on june   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued its decision upholding the rules 

table of contents aps does not expect the tailoring rule to have a significant impact on its current operations 
the rule will require aps to consider the impact of ghg emissions as part of its traditional new source review analysis for new sources and major modifications to existing plants 
on december   pursuant to its authority under the clean air act  epa finalized a ghg federal implementation plan fip for arizona relating to pre construction permits for construction of new sources or major modifications of existing sources 
subsequently  in march  epa and adeq entered into an agreement under which epa delegated to adeq authority to issue ghg pre construction permits and to modify existing ghg pre construction permits 
the ghg fip will remain in place until such time as epa approves a state implementation plan sip that applies pre construction permit requirements to ghg emitting stationary sources in arizona 
aps does not expect the ghg fip to have a significant impact on its current operations 
pursuant to its authority under the clean air act  on march   epa proposed new source performance standards nsps for ghg emissions from new electric generating units 
once finalized  aps does not expect the ghg nsps for new units to have an impact on its current operations 
epa has indicated that the rule will not apply to modified  reconstructed  or existing electric generating units 
it is unclear when  or if  epa will propose such standards  which could affect four corners  cholla  and the navajo plant once promulgated 
at the present time  we cannot predict what other rules or regulations may ultimately result from epa s endangerment finding and what impact other potential rules or regulations will have on aps s operations 
if any emission reduction legislation or additional regulations are enacted  we will assess our compliance alternatives  which may include replacement of existing equipment  installation of additional pollution control equipment  purchase of allowances  retirement or suspension of operations at certain coal fired facilities  or other actions 
although associated capital expenditures or operating costs resulting from ghg emission regulations or legislation could be material  we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental compliance initiatives through our regulated rates 
company response to climate change initiatives 
we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns  including renewable energy procurement and development  promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation  renewable energy use and energy efficiency 
see energy sources and resource planning current and future resources above for details of these plans and initiatives 
aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources  including wind  geothermal  solar  biogas and biomass  and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is produced by renewable resources 
aps prepares an inventory of ghg emissions from its operations 
this inventory is reported to epa under the epa ghg reporting program and is voluntarily communicated to the public in pinnacle west s annual corporate responsibility report  which is available on our website www

in february  the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina  alaska filed a lawsuit in federal court in the northern district of california against nine oil 
table of contents companies  fourteen power companies including pinnacle west  and a coal company  alleging that the defendants emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and constitute a public and private nuisance under both federal and state law 
the plaintiffs also allege that the effects of global warming will require the relocation of the village  and they are seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages 
in june  the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action  which were granted 
the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in november on september   a three judge panel of the ninth circuit affirmed the district court s dismissal of the kivalina plaintiffs federal common law public nuisance action 
the court declined to address any other issue raised by the parties  including the plaintiffs state nuisance law claim 
on october   the plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing by the entire ninth circuit  but on november   the court denied the plaintiffs petition 
aps continues to believe the action in kivalina is without merit and will continue to defend against both the federal and state claims 
epa environmental regulation regional haze rules 
over a decade ago  epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas 
the rules require states or  for sources located on tribal land  epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the best available retrofit technology bart for certain older major stationary sources 
epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule  which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 
the four corners and navajo plant participants obligations to comply with epa s final bart determinations and cholla s obligations to comply with adeq s and epa s determinations  coupled with the financial impact of potential future climate change legislation  other environmental regulations  and other business considerations  could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 
cholla 
in  adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla pursuant to the clean air visibility rule 
aps completed the bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq on february  the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart 
adeq reviewed aps s recommendations and submitted its proposed bart sip for cholla and other sources within the state on march  on december   epa provided notice of a proposed consent decree to address a lawsuit filed by a number of environmental organizations  which alleged that epa failed to promulgate fips for states that have not yet submitted all or part of the required regional haze sips 
in accordance with the consent decree  on december   epa issued a final bart rule applicable to cholla 
epa approved adeq s bart emissions limits for sulfur dioxide so and emissions of particulate matter pm  but added an so removal efficiency requirement of 
in addition  epa 
table of contents disapproved adeq s bart determinations for oxides of nitrogen nox and promulgated a fip establishing a new  more stringent bubbled nox emissions rate applicable to the two bart eligible cholla units owned by aps and the other bart eligible unit owned by pacificorp 
in order to comply with this new rate  aps will be required to install selective catalytic reduction scr technology on all three of the cholla units 
aps s total costs for these post combustion nox controls would be approximately million 
this amount is not included in our current estimates for environmental capital expenditures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures in item under the fip  aps has five years from december to complete installation of the equipment and achieve the bart emissions limit for nox 
aps believes that epa s final rule as it applies to cholla is unsupported and that epa had no basis for disapproving arizona s sip and promulgating a fip that is inconsistent with the state s considered bart determinations under the regional haze program 
accordingly  on february   aps filed a petition for review of the final bart rule in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
the state of arizona and three other utilities also filed similar petitions 
on february   aps filed a petition for reconsideration and stay of the final bart rule with epa 
four corners 
on august   epa issued its final bart determination for four corners 
the rule includes two compliance alternatives 
the first emission control alternative finalized by epa would require the installation of post combustion controls on each of units at four corners to reduce nox emissions 
current estimates indicate that aps s share of total costs for four corners for these controls would be approximately million 
under the second emission control alternative finalized by epa  the owners of four corners would have the option to permanently close units by january  and install post combustion nox controls on each of units and by july  aps s share of total costs for these controls would be approximately million 
the majority of these costs are not included in the capital expenditure estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures in item  since they would be incurred in years following for pm emissions  epa is requiring units and to meet an emission limit of lb mmbtu and units to meet a opacity limit  both of which are achievable through operation of the existing baghouses 
because the mercury and air toxics standards will force the installation of baghouses on units if aps chooses not to close those units  epa determined it is not necessary or appropriate to set new pm limits for units under the final four corners bart rule 
see mercury and other hazardous air pollutants for additional details of these standards 
although unrelated to bart  the final bart rule also imposes a opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions from four corners coal and material handling operations 
the four corners participants have until july  to notify epa of which emission control approach four corners will follow 
on october   wildearth guardians filed a petition for review in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit alleging that epa violated the endangered species act esa when it promulgated the final four corners bart fip 
on november   aps filed a motion for leave to intervene as a defendant  and the court granted that motion on december  epa and aps have pending motions with the court to dismiss the petition or  in the alternative  transfer the case to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit  the circuit in which we believe the petition should have been filed 
we cannot currently predict the outcome of this case or whether such outcome will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents navajo plant 
on january   epa issued a proposed bart rule for the navajo plant  which would require installation of scr technology in order to achieve a new  more stringent plantwide nox emission limit 
under the proposal  the navajo plant participants would have up to five years after epa issues its final determinations to achieve compliance with the bart requirements 
aps s total costs for post combustion nox controls could be up to approximately million 
the majority of these costs are not included in the capital expenditure estimates described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures in item  since they will be incurred in years following epa s proposal also includes an alternative to bart  which would provide the navajo plant with additional time to install the scr technology 
under this better than bart alternative  the navajo plant participants would be required to install scr technology on one unit per year in  and epa is also requesting comments on other options that could set longer time frames for installing pollution controls if the navajo plant can achieve additional emission reductions 
comments are due to epa by may  mercury and other hazardous air pollutants 
on december   epa issued the final mercury and air toxics standards mats  which established maximum achievable control technology mact standards to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossil fired power plants 
generally  plants will have three years after the effective date of the rule to achieve compliance 
in the case of cholla  aps will have a total of four years after the mats effective date to comply with the new mact standards because on september   the permitting authority granted aps s request for a one year compliance date extension 
the mats will require aps to install additional pollution control equipment 
aps has installed certain of the equipment necessary to meet the anticipated standards 
aps currently estimates that the cost for the remaining equipment necessary to meet these standards is approximately million for cholla units the estimated costs for four corners units are not included in our current environmental expenditure estimates since our estimates assume the consummation of aps s purchase of sce s interest in four corners units and and the subsequent shut down of units cholla s estimated costs for the next three years are included in our environmental expenditure estimates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures in item for details of our capital expenditure estimates 
srp  the operating agent for the navajo plant  is still evaluating compliance options under the mats 
cooling water intake structures 
epa issued its proposed cooling water intake structures rule on april   which provides national standards applicable to certain cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to section b of the clean water act 
the proposed standards are intended to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by minimizing impingement mortality the capture of aquatic wildlife on intake structures or against screens and entrainment mortality the capture of fish or shellfish in water flow entering and passing through intake structures 
to minimize impingement mortality  the proposed rule would require facilities  such as four corners and the navajo plant  to either demonstrate that impingement mortality at its cooling water intakes does not exceed a specified rate or reduce the flow at those structures to less than a specified velocity  and to take certain protective measures with respect to impinged fish 
to minimize entrainment mortality  the proposed rule would also require these facilities to conduct a structured site specific analysis to determine what site specific controls  if any  should be required 
additional studies and a peer review process will also be required at these facilities 

table of contents as proposed  existing facilities subject to the rule would have to comply with the impingement mortality requirements as soon as possible  but in no event later than eight years after the effective date of the rule  and would have to comply with the entrainment requirements as soon as possible under a schedule of compliance established by the permitting authority 
aps is performing analyses to determine the costs of compliance with the proposed rule 
epa is working to finalize the standards by june  coal combustion waste 
on june   epa released its proposed regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals ccrs  such as fly ash and bottom ash 
aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners  and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production 
epa proposes regulating ccrs as either non hazardous waste or hazardous waste and requested comments on three different alternatives 
the hazardous waste proposal would phase out the use of ash ponds for disposal of ccrs 
the other two proposals would regulate ccrs as non hazardous waste and impose performance standards for ash disposal 
one of these proposals would require retrofitting or closure of currently unlined ash ponds  while the other proposal would not require the installation of liners or pond closures 
epa has not yet indicated a preference for any of the alternatives 
on april   a coalition of environmental groups filed suit to compel epa to finalize its proposed ccr rule 
soon thereafter  coal ash recyclers filed similar lawsuits against epa 
although we do not know when epa will issue a final rule or by when compliance will ultimately be required  in an october  filing with the court  epa took the position that it will need at least a year to finalize the rule 
motions and cross motions for summary judgment are currently pending before the court 
we cannot currently predict the outcome of the lawsuit or epa s actions or whether such actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
effluent limitation guidelines 
epa is subject to a consent decree deadline to propose revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technology based wastewater discharge limitations for fossil fired electric generating units by april   and to finalize the rule by may  epa has indicated that it expects the revised standards to target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities and scrubber related operations 
if epa requires such conversions under the final rule  four corners may be required to change equipment and operating practices affecting boilers and ash handling systems  as well as change their waste disposal techniques 
epa may also revise standards for metals and other pollutants for wastewater streams not associated with ash handling 
we cannot currently predict the shape of epa s final rule or whether this action will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
ozone national ambient air quality standards 
in march  epa adopted new  more stringent eight hour ozone standards  known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 
in january  epa proposed to adopt even more stringent eight hour ozone naaqs 
however  on september   president obama decided to withdraw epa s revised ozone standards until at least when epa would be required to review them as part of its five year naaqs review process 
as ozone standards become more stringent  our fossil generation units may come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and or to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions 
at this time  aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents new source review 
on april   aps received a request from epa under section of the clean air act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of four corners 
this request is part of an enforcement initiative that epa has undertaken under the clean air act 
epa has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under the new source review provisions of the clean air act 
other electric utilities have received and responded to similar section requests  and several of them have been the subject of notices of violation and lawsuits by epa 
aps responded to epa s request in august and is currently unable to predict the timing or content of epa s response  if any  or any resulting actions 
clean air act lawsuit 
on october   earthjustice  on behalf of several environmental organizations  filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico against aps and the other four corners participants alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the clean air act 
subsequent to filing its original complaint  on january   earthjustice filed a first amended complaint adding claims for violations of the clean air act s nsps program 
among other things  the plaintiffs seek to have the court enjoin operations at four corners until aps applies for and obtains any required nsr permits and complies with the nsps 
the plaintiffs further request the court to order the payment of civil penalties  including a beneficial mitigation project 
on april   aps and the other four corners participants filed motions to dismiss  which are pending 
we are unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring 
endangered species act 
on january   the center for biological diversity  din citizens against ruining our environment  and san juan citizens alliance filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of colorado against osm and doi  alleging that osm failed to engage in mandatory esa consultation with the fish and wildlife service prior to authorizing the renewal of an operating permit for the mine that serves four corners 
the lawsuit alleged that activities at the mine  including mining and the disposal of coal combustion residuals  would adversely affect several endangered species and their critical habitats 
aps is not a party to the lawsuit but is monitoring it to determine its potential impact on aps s operations 
on march   the district court entered an order dismissing the plaintiffs lawsuit without prejudice 
on may   the plaintiffs appealed the court s order to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
superfund 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil  water or air 
those who generated  transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are potentially responsible parties prps 
prps may be strictly  and often are jointly and severally  liable for clean up 
on september   epa advised aps that epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola nd street superfund site  operable unit ou in phoenix  arizona 
aps has facilities that are within this superfund site 
aps and pinnacle west have agreed with epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou in addition  on september   aps agreed with epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan 
we estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately million 
we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future  but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized  at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated 

table of contents manufactured gas plant sites 
certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of  or sites associated with  manufactured gas plants 
aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites 
aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
navajo nation environmental issues four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation 
see energy sources and resource planning generation facilities coal fueled generating facilities above for additional information regarding these plants 
in july  the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act  the navajo nation safe drinking water act  and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively  the navajo acts 
the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality  drinking water  and pesticide activities  including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant 
on october   the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation  window rock district  challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant 
the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties  and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 
in april  the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act 
aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations 
on july   the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations 
those proceedings have been stayed  pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above 
aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 
on may   aps  salt river project  as the operating agent for the navajo plant  and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act 
as a result of this agreement  aps sought  and the courts granted  dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court  to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act 
the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts 
aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 
water supply assured supplies of water are important for aps s generating plants 
at the present time  aps has adequate water to meet its needs 
however  the four corners region  in which four corners is located  has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area 
aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect  if any  on future operations of the plant 
the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time  and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome  if any  of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available  or the price thereof  from four corners 

table of contents conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions  which  in addition to future supply conditions  have the potential to impact aps operations 
san juan river adjudication 
both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps s operations have been the subject of inquiries  claims  and legal proceedings  which will require a number of years to resolve 
aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding  filed march   before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived 
an agreement reached with the navajo nation in  however  provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication  the navajo nation will provide  for an agreed upon cost  sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 
gila river adjudication 
a summons served on aps in early required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january   in an action pending in arizona superior court 
palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons 
aps s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action 
as operating agent of palo verde  aps filed claims that dispute the court s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde 
alternatively  aps seeks confirmation of such rights 
five of aps s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons 
aps s claims dispute the court s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants 
alternatively  aps seeks confirmation of such rights 
in november  the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes 
in addition  in september  the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court s criteria for resolving groundwater claims 
litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court 
in december  aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights 
the court denied the petition in may  and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its order 
no trial date concerning aps s water rights claims has been set in this matter 
little colorado river adjudication 
aps has filed claims to water in the little colorado river watershed in arizona in an action pending in the apache county  arizona  superior court  which was originally filed on september  aps s groundwater resource utilized at cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and  therefore  is potentially at issue in the case 
aps s claims dispute the court s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights 
alternatively  aps seeks confirmation of such rights 
other claims have been identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court 
no trial date concerning aps s water rights claims has been set in this matter

item a 
risk factors in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report  set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 
unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires  the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries  including aps 
regulatory risks our financial condition depends upon aps s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 
aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business  liquidity  results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner 
the acc regulates aps s retail electric rates and the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services 
the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates 
consequently  our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and the ferc 
arizona  like certain other states  has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify final orders under certain circumstances 
the acc must also approve aps s issuance of securities and any transfer of aps property used to provide retail electric service  and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us  aps and our respective affiliates 
decisions made by the acc or the ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
aps s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal  state or local statutes  regulations and acc requirements  and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits  approvals and certificates 
aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes  regulations  rules  tariffs  and orders of agencies that regulate aps s business  including the ferc  the nrc  epa  the acc and state and local governmental agencies 
these agencies regulate many aspects of aps s utility operations  including safety and performance  emissions  siting and construction of facilities  customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers 
failure to comply can subject aps to  among other things  fines and penalties 
for example  under the energy policy act of  the ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards 
in addition to penalties  aps may be unable to recover certain costs if  for example  it fails to implement any of its annual acc approved renewable implementation plans 
aps is also required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from these agencies 
aps believes the necessary permits  approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects 
however  changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we are also unable to predict 
table of contents the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 
the operation of aps s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities 
events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the nrc to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities  including palo verde 
as a result of the march earthquake and tsunami that caused significant damage to the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant in japan  various industry organizations are working to analyze information from the japan incident and develop action plans for us nuclear power plants 
additionally  the nrc is performing its own independent review of the events at fukushima daiichi  including a review of the agency s processes and regulations in order to determine whether the agency should promulgate additional regulations and possibly make more fundamental changes to the nrc s system of regulation 
we cannot predict when or if the nrc will take formal action as a result of its review 
the financial and or operational impacts on palo verde and aps may be significant 
in the event of noncompliance with its requirements  the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit  or both  depending upon the nrc s assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
the increased costs resulting from penalties  a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  and changes in  or liabilities under  existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps s cost of operations or impact its business plans 
aps is  or may become  subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations  including air emissions  water quality  discharges of wastewater and streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities  solid waste  hazardous waste  and coal combustion products  which consist of bottom ash  fly ash  and air pollution control wastes 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating  and other costs  particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations 
these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  and other approvals 
if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval  or if aps fails to obtain  maintain  or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses 
in addition  failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties 
both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations 
aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 
environmental clean up 
aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix  arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body 
aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs 

table of contents there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
regional haze 
aps has received final rulemaking imposing new requirements on four corners and cholla and is currently awaiting a final rulemaking from epa that could impose new requirements on the navajo plant 
epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes the best available retrofit technology to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants 
the financial impact of installing and operating the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 
coal ash 
epa released proposed regulations governing the disposal of ccrs  which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of  among other things  fly ash and bottom ash 
epa proposed regulating ccrs as either non hazardous or hazardous waste 
aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at four corners and cholla  and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete products 
if epa regulates ccrs as a hazardous solid waste or phases out aps s ability to dispose of ccrs through the use of ash ponds  aps could incur significant costs for ccr disposal and may be unable to continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse 
effluent limitation guidelines 
epa is expected to propose revised effluent limitation guidelines establishing technology based wastewater discharge limitations for fossil fired electric generating units by april   and to promulgate a final rule by may  epa has indicated that it expects the revised standards to target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities and scrubber related operations 
aps currently disposes of fly ash waste and bottom ash in ash ponds at four corners 
changes required by the rule could significantly increase ash disposal costs at four corners 
new source review 
epa has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have performed are major modifications that trigger new source review requirements under the clean air act 
the utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance and did not result in emissions increases  and thus are not subject to new source review 
in  aps received and responded to a request from epa regarding projects and operations of four corners 
an environmental organization filed suit against the four corners participants for alleged violations of new source review and the nsps programs of the clean air act 
if epa seeks to impose new source review requirements at four corners or any other aps plant  or if the citizens group prevails in its lawsuit  significant capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies 
epa could also seek civil penalties 
aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it 
revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps s customers  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
due to current or potential future regulations or legislation  the economics of continuing to own certain resources  particularly coal facilities  may deteriorate  warranting early retirement of those plants  which may result in asset impairments 
aps would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement  but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery 

table of contents aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate change  and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
concern over climate change  deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel  and other greenhouse gas emissions 
in addition  lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases  including a lawsuit filed by the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina  alaska against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change 
financial risks potential legislation and regulation 
it is possible that some form of legislation or epa action to regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions may occur in the future at the federal level 
if the united states congress  or individual states or groups of states in which aps operates  ultimately pass legislation  or if epa promulgates additional regulations regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases from existing generation facilities  any resulting limitations on co and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes  emissions allowances  or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation facilities particularly coal fired facilities  which constitute approximately of aps s generation capacity 
at the state level  the california legislature enacted legislation to address greenhouse gas emissions and the california air resources board approved regulations that will establish a cap and trade program for greenhouse gas 
this legislation  regulation and other state specific initiatives may affect aps s business  including sales into the impacted states or the ability of its out of state power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coal fired power plants  including four corners following physical and operational risks 
weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest s desert area  and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system 
large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

table of contents deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition  which could have a significant adverse impact on aps s business and its results of operations 
in  the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona 
retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets  a loss of retail customers  lower profit margins or increased costs of capital 
although some very limited retail competition existed in aps s service area in and  there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps s customers 
as a result  aps cannot predict if  when  and the extent to which  additional competitors may re enter aps s service territory 
several acc commissioners have publicly expressed interest in re examining retail electric competition in aps cannot predict how and when this re examination might take place 
in  the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for non profit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not public service corporations under the arizona constitution  and are therefore not regulated by the acc 
a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model 
the use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition 
aps cannot predict whether the acc will deem these vendors public service corporations subject to acc regulation and when  and the extent to which  additional service providers will enter aps s service territory  increasing the level of competition in the market 
operational risks aps s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 
weather conditions 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities 
electric power demand is generally a seasonal business 
in arizona  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also peaking at that time 
as a result  aps s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  aps has historically sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions are milder 
as a result  unusually mild weather could diminish aps s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack  which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires 
forest fires could threaten aps s communities and electric transmission lines 
any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy 
the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a annual energy savings requirement by this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demand side management efforts  which in turn will impact the demand for electricity 
the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives  recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost income revenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements 
to that end  the settlement agreement in aps s recent retail rate case the settlement agreement includes a mechanism  the lfcr  to address these matters 
the 
table of contents retail rate case settlement agreement also established energy efficiency goals for aps that extended through  subjecting aps to energy efficiency requirements slightly greater for the first two of those years than required under the rules described above 
aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements 
a portion of aps s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally  small scale renewable technologies located on customers properties 
the distributed energy requirement was of the overall res requirement of in and increased to of the applicable res requirement for and subsequent years 
customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand  since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs 
reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements  unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms  could have a material adverse impact on aps s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  higher than anticipated penetration of distributed energy may also cause portions of aps s existing resource fleet  such as coal  to become uneconomic or operationally burdensome 
customer and sales growth 
for the three years through  aps s customer growth averaged per year 
we currently expect annual customer growth to average about for through based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions  both nationally and in arizona 
for the three years through  aps experienced annual declines in retail electricity sales averaging  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations 
we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will remain about flat on average during through  excluding the effects of weather variations 
actual customer and sales growth may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors  such as economic conditions  customer growth and usage patterns  and the effects of energy efficiency and distributed energy programs and requirements 
if our customer growth rate does not continue to improve as projected  or if it declines  or if the arizona economy fails to improve  we may be unable to reach our estimated demand level and sales projections  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages  which could materially affect aps s results of operations 
the operation of power generation  transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks  including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
unscheduled outages  including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications  occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps s business 
because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties  the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid  and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others 
if aps s facilities operate below expectations  especially during its peak seasons  it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses  including increased purchased power expenses 

table of contents the inability to successfully develop or acquire generation resources to meet new or evolving standards and regulations could adversely impact our business 
potential changes in regulatory standards  impacts of new and existing laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations  and the need to obtain certain regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our generation portfolio 
in addition  aps is required by the acc to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements and the res 
the development of any renewable generation facilities resulting from the res is subject to many other risks  including risks related to financing  siting  permitting  technology  the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities and stresses to generation and transmission resources from intermittent generation characteristics of renewable resources 
aps s inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary generation resources to meet the required standards could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps s business and results of operations 
assured supplies of water are important for aps s generating plants 
water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water 
both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries  claims and legal proceedings 
in addition  the region in which aps s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions  which could potentially affect the plants water supplies 
aps s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases  easements and rights of way  which could have a significant impact on our business 
certain aps power plants  including four corners  and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to leases  easements or other rights of way that are effective for specified periods 
aps is currently unable to predict the final outcome of pending and future approvals by applicable governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases  easements and rights of way 
there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities  such as environmental  health  fuel supply  spent fuel disposal  regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 
aps has an ownership interest in and operates  on behalf of a group of participants  palo verde  which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states 
palo verde constitutes approximately of our owned and leased generation capacity 
palo verde is subject to environmental  health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel  the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel  the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning  potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities  the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks  and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems 
aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks  however  it is possible that damages could 
table of contents exceed the amount of insurance coverage 
in addition  aps may be required under federal law to pay up to million but not more than million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde  but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states 
although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde  if an incident did occur  it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures and or increase operating costs 
the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 
aps s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices 
aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist 
we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options  and swaps 
as part of our overall risk management program  we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity 
to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid  we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies  which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act  which was signed into law in july  contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the over the counter  or otc  derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation 
the dodd frank act could restrict  among other things  trading positions in the energy futures markets  require different collateral or settlement positions  or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions 
based on the provisions included in the dodd frank act and the implementation of regulations  these changes could  among other things  impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 
we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties 
we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties 
despite the fact that the majority of aps s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies  there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default  which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 
changes in technology could create challenges for aps s existing business 
research and development activities are ongoing to assess alternative technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption  including clean coal and coal gasification  renewable technologies including photovoltaic solar cells  customer sited generation solar and efficiency technologies  and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment  such as more efficient gas turbines 
advances in these  or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production  making aps s existing generating facilities less economical 
in addition  advances in technology and equipment appliance efficiency could reduce the demand for power supply  which could adversely affect aps s business 

table of contents aps is pursuing and implementing smart grid technologies  including advanced transmission and distribution system technologies  as well as digital meters enabling two way communications between the utility and its customers 
many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested  and their use on large scale systems is not as advanced and established as aps s existing technologies and equipment 
uncertainties and unknowns related to these and other advancements in technology and equipment could adversely affect aps s business if national standards develop that do not embrace the current technologies or if the technologies and equipment fail to perform as expected 
in addition  widespread installation and acceptance of these devices could enable the entry of new market participants  such as technology companies  into the interface between aps and its customers 
we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
like most companies in the electric utility industry  our workforce is aging and a number of our employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years 
although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees  we may not be successful 
we are subject to other employee workforce factors  such as the availability of qualified personnel  the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages 
exposure to these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to information security risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems 
in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security  customer and business systems information 
we are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information 
a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information  including confidential customer  employee  financial or system operating information  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure 
despite implementation of security measures  our technology systems are vulnerable to disability  failures or unauthorized access 
our generation  transmission and distribution facilities  information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of such unauthorized access 
failures or breaches of our systems could impact the reliability of our generation  transmission and distribution systems and also subject us to financial harm 
if our technology systems were to fail or be breached and if we are unable to recover in a timely way  we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential data could be compromised  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the implementation of security measures and cost of insurance addressing such activities could increase costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
these types of events could also require significant management attention and resources  and could adversely affect pinnacle west s and aps s reputation with customers and the public 

table of contents financial risks financial market disruptions or new financial rules or regulations may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit markets  which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 
we rely on access to credit markets as a significant source of liquidity and the capital markets for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from our operations 
we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets 
however  certain market disruptions or rules or regulations may increase our cost of borrowing generally  and or otherwise adversely affect our ability to access these financial markets 
in addition  the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied for a variety of reasons  including periods of financial distress or liquidity issues affecting our lenders  which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources 
changes in economic conditions  monetary policy or other factors could result in higher interest rates  which would increase our interest expense on our existing variable rate debt and new debt we expect to issue in the future  and thus reduce funds available to us for our current plans 
additionally  an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by causing a downgrade of our credit ratings  increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  and requiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  which would reduce funds available to us for operations  future business opportunities or other purposes 
a downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current ratings are set forth in liquidity and capital resources credit ratings in item we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west s and aps s securities  limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs  which would diminish our financial results 
we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings  and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease 
in addition  borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings 
a downgrade would also require us to provide substantial additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties 
if our short term ratings were to be lowered  it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market 
we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

table of contents investment performance  changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase the valuation of our related obligations  resulting in significant additional funding requirements 
we are subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and recent healthcare reform legislation 
any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition 
we have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees and legal obligations to fund nuclear decommissioning trusts for palo verde 
we hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise 
declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements 
additionally  the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate  which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
declining interest rates decrease the discount rate  increase the valuation of the plan liabilities and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs  cash contributions  regulatory assets  and charges to other comprehensive income 
changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions  may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation 
increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans  resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise  could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we recover most of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates 
any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner would have a material negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
employee healthcare costs in recent years have continued to rise 
the patient protection and affordable care act is expected to result in additional healthcare cost increases 
costs and other effects of the legislation  which may include the cost of compliance and potentially increased costs of providing for medical insurance for our employees  cannot be determined with certainty at this time 
we will continue to monitor healthcare legislation and its impact on our plans and costs 
our cash flow depends on the performance of aps 
currently  we derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly owned subsidiary  aps 
accordingly  our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us 
aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 
aps s debt agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends  make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us 
in addition  an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold 
the common equity ratio  as defined in the acc order  is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt 

table of contents pinnacle west s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 
because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company  all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities 
the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available  in the first instance  to service their own debt and other obligations 
our ability to have the benefit of their cash flows  particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries  would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  developments generally affecting industries in which we operate  particularly the energy distribution and energy generation industries  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  joint marketing relationships  joint ventures or capital commitments  announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us  favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments  our dividend policy  future sales by the company of equity or equity linked securities  and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 
these provisions  which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium  include the following restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of business combination transactions with an interested shareholder generally  any person who owns or more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder  unless specific conditions are met  anti greenmail provisions of arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than of our outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied  
table of contents the ability of the board of directors to increase the size of the board and fill vacancies on the board  whether resulting from such increase  or from death  resignation  disqualification or otherwise  and the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and  with respect to preferred stock  the other terms  including preferences and voting rights  of those shares without shareholder approval 
while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors  they could enable the board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some  or a majority  of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and  in that case  may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 
suncor s continuing wind down of its real estate business may give rise to various claims 
since  suncor has been engaged in a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations  master planned communities  land parcels  commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt 
suncor is focusing on concluding an orderly wind down of its business and  as of december   suncor had no assets 
this effort includes addressing contingent liabilities  such as warranty and construction claims that may be brought by property owners and potential funding obligations to local taxing districts that financed infrastructure at certain of its real estate developments 
pinnacle west has not guaranteed any of suncor s obligations 
in february  suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business

in aps s plan  aps projects it will develop miles of new lines over the next ten years 
one significant project currently under development is a new kv path that will span from the palo verde hub around the western and northern edges of the phoenix metropolitan area and terminate at a bulk substation in the northeast part of phoenix 
the project consists of four phases 
the first phase  
table of contents morgan to pinnacle peak kv  is currently in service 
the second phase  delaney to palo verde kv  is under construction 
the third and fourth phases  delaney to sun valley kv and morgan to sun valley kv  have been permitted and are in various stages of final design and development 
in total  the projects consist of over miles of new kv lines  with many of those miles constructed as capable of stringing a kv line as a second circuit 
aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities 
two such projects  which are included in aps s transmission plan  are the delaney to palo verde line and the north gila to hassayampa line  both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california 
plant and transmission line leases and rights of way on indian lands the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under rights of way from the federal government 
the right of way and lease for the navajo plant expire in and the right of way and lease for four corners expire in on march   the navajo nation council signed a resolution approving a year extension to the existing four corners lease term and providing navajo nation consent to renewal of the related rights of way 
aps is filing applications for renewal of these rights of way with the doi 
before it may approve the four corners lease extension and issue the renewed rights of way  the united states must complete an analysis under the federal national environmental policy act  the esa and related statutes 
certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to rights of way that are effective for specified periods 
some of these rights of way have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes or federal agencies 
other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe or federal agencies will be required at that time 
the majority of our transmission lines residing on indian lands are on the navajo nation 
in march  the navajo nation provided its consent to renew the rights of way for the transmission lines specified in the lease extension 
however  some of our rights of way are not covered by the leases  or are granted by other indian tribes or federal agencies 
in recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rights of way  certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rights of way 
the ultimate cost of renewal of the rights of way for our transmission lines not addressed in the lease extension is uncertain 
we are monitoring these right of way issues and have had extensive discussions with the respective tribes regarding the rights of way 
we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter

overview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area  the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 
aps accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings  and is expected to continue to do so 
areas of business focus operational performance  reliability and recent developments 
nuclear 
aps operates and is a joint owner of palo verde 
in  palo verde achieved its best generation year ever  producing over million megawatt hours  with an overall station capacity factor of 
in  palo verde successfully refueled both unit and unit aps management continues to work closely with regulators and others in the nuclear industry to analyze the lessons learned and address any rulemaking or improvements resulting from the march events impacting the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan 
coal and related environmental matters 
aps operated coal plants  four corners and cholla  achieved net capacity factors for aps of and  respectively  in these capacity factors were lower than in prior years primarily due to lower gas prices resulting in higher production from our gas fleet 
aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning greenhouse gas emissions 
concern over climate change and other emission related issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes  emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants 
aps is closely monitoring its long range capital management plans  understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants  as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades 
sce  a participant in four corners  has indicated that certain california legislation may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant 
on november   aps and sce entered into the asset purchase agreement  providing for the purchase by aps of sce s interest in each of units and of four corners 
the purchase price is million  subject to certain adjustments 
completion of the purchase by aps is subject to the receipt of approvals by the acc  the cpuc and the ferc 
on march   the cpuc issued an order approving the sale 
on april   the acc voted to allow aps to move forward with the purchase 
the asset purchase agreement provides that the purchase price will be reduced by million for each month between october  
table of contents and the closing date 
the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the transaction for cost recovery purposes in a future proceeding if the purchase closes 
the acc also authorized an accounting deferral of certain costs associated with the purchase until any such cost recovery proceeding concludes 
the ferc application seeking authorization for the transaction was approved on november  the principal remaining condition to closing is the negotiation and execution of a new coal supply contract on terms reasonably acceptable to aps 
on december   bhp billiton  the parent company of bncc  the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners  announced that it has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the navajo nation setting out the key terms under which full ownership of bncc would be sold to the navajo nation 
bhp billiton would be retained by bncc under contract as the mine manager and operator until july key terms of the new coal supply contract are being finalized by the navajo nation and aps and the other four corners co owners 
as a result of this proposed change in ownership of bncc  aps now expects that a new coal supply contract would be executed upon completion of negotiations and following the endorsement of the transfer of ownership of the stock of bncc to a new navajo nation commercial enterprise to be established by the navajo nation tribal council 
the decision of the tribal council is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  either aps or sce has a right to terminate the agreement if satisfaction of the closing conditions had not occurred by december   unless the party seeking to terminate is then in breach of the agreement 
aps  on behalf of the four corners participants  negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from to the navajo nation approved these amendments in march the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi  as does a related federal rights of way grant which the four corners participants will pursue 
a federal environmental review is underway as part of the doi review process 
aps has announced that  if aps s purchase of sce s interests in units and at four corners is consummated  it will close units  and at the plant 
aps owns of units these events will change the plant s overall generating capacity from  mw to  mw and aps s entitlement from the plant from mw to mw 
when the acc approved aps moving forward with the purchase of units and  it also approved the recovery of any unrecovered costs associated with the closure of units  and the settlement agreement in aps s most recent retail rate case allows aps to seek a rate adjustment to reflect the four corners transaction should the transaction close see note 
aps cannot predict whether the mutual right to terminate in the asset purchase agreement will be exercised by a party to that agreement in the future  whether bhp billiton and the navajo nation will consummate the transfer of ownership of bncc  or whether the coal supply contract will be finalized and executed  such that closing of aps s purchase of sce s interest in four corners can occur 
transmission and delivery 
aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current focus on renewable energy 
the capital expenditures table presented in the liquidity and capital resources section below includes the next three years of new 
table of contents transmission projects along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements 
aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technologies throughout its service territory designed to provide long term benefits both to aps and its customers 
aps is piloting and deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs  minimize system outage durations as well as the number of customers that experience outages  and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions  including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 
renewable energy 
the acc approved the res in the renewable energy requirement is of retail electric sales in and increases annually until it reaches in in the settlement agreement related to the retail rate case  aps agreed to exceed the res standards  committing to  gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by year end in addition to its renewable resource commitments 
taken together  aps s commitment is estimated to be approximately of aps s estimated retail energy sales by year end  which is more than double the existing res target of for that year 
a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking  small scale renewable technologies that are located on customers properties 
on june   aps filed its annual res implementation plan  covering the timeframe and requesting res funding of million to million 
in a final order dated january   the acc approved a budget of million for aps s res plan 
that budget includes million for residential distributed energy incentives and million for commercial distributed energy up front incentives  but did not include any funds for commercial distributed energy production based incentives 
the acc further ordered that a hearing take place to consider i aps s proposal to establish compliance with distributed energy requirements by tracking and recording distributed energy  rather than acquiring and retiring renewable energy credits  and ii removing retail sales to aps s largest industrial customers when calculating aps s compliance with the annual res requirements 
aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling  mw  including solar  wind  geothermal  biomass and biogas 
of this portfolio  mw are currently in operation and mw are under contract for development or are under construction 
renewable resources in operation include mw of solar facilities owned by aps  mw of long term purchased power agreements  and an estimated mw of customer sited  third party owned distributed energy resources 
to achieve our res requirements  as mentioned above  to date aps has entered into contracts for mw of renewable resources that are planned  in development or under construction 
aps s strategy to procure these resources includes new facilities to be owned by aps  purchased power contracts for new facilities and ongoing development of distributed energy resources 
through the az sun program  aps has executed contracts for the development of mw of new solar generation  representing an investment commitment of approximately million 
see note for additional details of the az sun program  including the related cost recovery 
aps has also entered into long term purchased power agreements for mw from solar facilities currently planned  in development or under construction  and mw from distributed energy resources 
agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions  including successful siting  permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid 

table of contents demand side management 
in recent years  arizona regulators have placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy  while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy 
in december  the acc initiated an energy efficiency rulemaking  with a proposed energy efficiency standard of cumulative annual energy savings by the figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through attributable to energy efficiency initiatives 
this ambitious standard became effective on january  and will likely impact arizona s future energy resource needs 
the acc issued an order on april  approving recovery of approximately million of aps s energy efficiency and demand side management program costs over a twelve month period beginning march  this amount does not include million already being recovered in general retail base rates 
on june   aps filed its demand side management implementation plan 
in  the standards will require aps to achieve cumulative energy savings equal to of its retail energy sales 
later in  aps filed a supplement to its plan that included a proposed budget for of million 
aps expects to receive a decision from the acc in the second quarter of rate matters 
aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health 
aps s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc 
on june   aps filed a rate case with the acc 
aps and other parties to the retail rate case subsequently entered into a settlement agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case 
see note for details regarding the settlement agreement terms and for information on aps s ferc rates 
aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs  and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs 
these mechanisms are described more fully in note as part of aps s proposed acquisition of sce s interest in units and of four corners  aps and sce agreed that upon closing of the acquisition or in if the closing does not occur  the companies will terminate an existing agreement that provides transmission capacity for sce to transmit its portion of the output from four corners to california 
aps expects to file a request with ferc seeking authorization to cancel the existing agreement and defer a million payment to be made by aps associated with the termination and recover the payment through amortization over a year period 
aps believes the costs associated with the termination of the existing agreement are recoverable  but cannot predict whether ferc will approve our request  however  if the recovery is disallowed by ferc  aps would record a charge to its results of operations at the time of the disallowance 
financial strength and flexibility 
pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities  and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company 
capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings  which may include issuances of long term debt and pinnacle west common stock 
other subsidiaries 
the operations of el dorado are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results  or to require any material amounts of capital  over the next three years 
as a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets  during our other first tier subsidiary  suncor  undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations  master planned 
table of contents communities  land parcels  commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt and  as of december   suncor had no assets 
in february  suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business 
all activities of suncor are now reported as discontinued operations see note 
suncor s loss in is primarily related to a contribution pinnacle west expects to make to suncor s estate as part of a negotiated resolution to the bankruptcy 
we do not expect suncor s bankruptcy to have a material impact on pinnacle west s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
key financial drivers in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above  many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook  including those listed below 
we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company s current needs  and to adjust our expectations  financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 
electric operating revenues 
for the years through  retail electric revenues comprised approximately of our total electric operating revenues 
our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline  variations in weather from period to period  customer mix  average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs  distributed energy additions  electricity rates and tariffs  the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms 
off system sales of excess generation output  purchased power and natural gas are included in operating revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps s retail customers through the psa 
these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions  including competition  demand and prices 
customer and sales growth 
retail customer growth in aps s service territory in was compared with the comparable prior year 
for the three years through  aps s customer growth averaged per year 
we currently expect annual customer growth to average about for through based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions  both nationally and in arizona 
retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations  increased in compared with the prior year  reflecting the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives  offset by mildly improving economic conditions 
for the three years through  aps experienced annual declines in retail electricity sales averaging  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations 
we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will remain about flat on average during through  including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives  but excluding the effects of weather variations 
a failure of the arizona economy to continue to improve could further impact these estimates 
actual sales growth  excluding weather related variations  may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors  such as economic conditions  customer growth  usage patterns  impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation  and responses to retail price changes 
our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 

table of contents weather 
in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above  we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data 
historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of million 
however  our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
fuel and purchased power costs 
fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  transmission availability or constraints  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas  changes in our generation resource allocation  our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 
operations and maintenance expenses 
operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth  power plant operations  maintenance of utility plant including generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs  renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues and other factors 
in the settlement agreement related to the retail rate case  aps committed to operational expense reductions from through and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases incurred in and  which totaled million  as a regulatory asset  until the most recent general retail rate case decision became effective on july  in july  we began amortizing the regulatory asset over a month period 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  and changes in depreciation and amortization rates 
see capital expenditures below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities 
as a result of the twenty year extensions of the operating licenses for each of the palo verde units granted by the nrc in  we decreased our pretax depreciation expense related to palo verde by approximately million per year starting on january  property taxes 
taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by the value of property in service and under construction  assessment ratios  and tax rates 
the average property tax rate in arizona for aps  which owns essentially all of our property  was of the assessed value for  for  and for we expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units  transmission and distribution facilities 
see note for property tax deferrals contained in the settlement agreement 
income taxes 
income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income  income tax rates  certain deductions and non taxable items  such as afudc 
in addition  income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 
interest expense 
interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note 
the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures  long term debt maturities  equity issuances and internally generated cash flow 
an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense 
table of contents while capital projects are under construction 
we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 
results of operations pinnacle west s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment  which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electricity service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation  transmission and distribution 
apses s and suncor s operations have been classified as discontinued operations 
pinnacle west sold its investment in apses in august in february  suncor filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code to complete an orderly liquidation of its business see note 
operating results compared with our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million  compared with net income of million for the prior year 
the results reflect an increase of approximately million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to increases related to the retail regulatory settlement effective july  see note  higher retail transmission revenues  lower depreciation and amortization due to year palo verde license extensions received in  and lower net interest charges due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates in the current year 
the million decrease in discontinued operations is primarily related to a contribution pinnacle west expects to make to suncor s estate as part of a negotiated resolution to the bankruptcy see note and absence of the gain on sale of our investment in apses

liquidity and capital resources overview pinnacle west s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 
on december   the pinnacle west board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share of common stock  payable on march  to shareholders of record on february  during  pinnacle west increased its indicated annual dividend from per share to per share 
the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors based on a number of factors including our financial condition  payout ratio  free cash flow and other factors 
our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances 
an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 
as defined in the acc order  the common equity ratio is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt 
at december   aps s common equity ratio  as defined  was 
its total shareholder equity was approximately billion  and total capitalization was approximately billion 
under this order  aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately billion  assuming aps s total capitalization remains the same 
this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
aps s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of long term debt 
aps funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and  to the extent necessary  external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle west 
many of aps s current capital expenditure projects qualify for bonus depreciation 
the american taxpayer relief act of  signed into law on january   includes provisions extending the eligibility for bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service in as a result of this provision  and the previously enacted bonus depreciation provisions provided for in the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of  total cash tax benefits of up to million are expected to be generated for aps through accelerated depreciation 
the cash generated is an acceleration of the tax benefits that aps would have otherwise received over years 
it is anticipated that these cash benefits will be fully realized by aps by the end of  with a majority of the benefit realized as of december  summary of cash flows the following tables present net cash provided by used for operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and dollars in millions

the increase is primarily related to a million reduction of cash collateral posted and a decrease of million in cash paid for interest in the current year  partially offset by a million increase in property tax payments  a million pension contribution in approximately million of which is reflected in capital expenditures and other changes in working capital 
compared with pinnacle west s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was  million in  compared to million in  an increase of million in net cash provided 
the increase is primarily due to the million change in collateral and margin posted  as a result of changes in commodity prices and expiration of prior hedge contracts  and a million voluntary pension contribution in approximately million of which is reflected in capital expenditures 
in addition  aps s operating cash flows included income tax payments to the parent company of approximately million in other pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries 
the requirements of the employee retirement security act of erisa require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan 
we contribute at least the minimum amount required under erisa regulations  but no more than the maximum tax deductible amount 
the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension benefit obligations 
under erisa  the qualified pension plan was funded as of january  and funded as of january  the assets in the plan are comprised of fixed income  equity  real estate  and short term investments 
future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions 
we made contributions to our pension plan totaling million in  zero in and million in the minimum contributions for the pension plan due in  and under the recently enacted moving ahead for progress in the st century act map are estimated to be zero  million and million  respectively

the million long term income tax receivable on the consolidated balance sheets represents the anticipated refunds related to an aps tax accounting method change approved by the internal revenue service irs in the third quarter of this amount is classified as long term  as there remains uncertainty regarding the timing of this cash receipt 
further clarification of the timing is expected from the irs within the next twelve months 
investing cash flows compared with pinnacle west s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million in net cash used 
the increase in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to the absence of million in proceeds from the sale of life insurance policies in and the absence of million in proceeds from the sale of pinnacle west s investment in apses in compared with pinnacle west s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million in net cash used 
the increase in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to an increase of million in capital expenditures and a decrease of million in net proceeds from the sales of our non utility businesses see note  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of life insurance policies in capital expenditures the following table summarizes the estimated capital expenditures for the next three years capital expenditures dollars in millions estimated for the year ended december  aps generation nuclear fuel renewables environmental four corners units and other generation distribution transmission other a total aps a primarily information systems and facilities projects 

table of contents generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps s existing fossil and nuclear plants 
examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions  upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment  such as turbines  boilers and environmental equipment 
for purposes of this table  we have assumed the consummation of aps s purchase of sce s interest in four corners units and and the subsequent shutdown of units  as discussed in the overview section above 
as a result  we included the estimated million purchase price under generation and have not included environmental expenditures for units we have not included estimated costs for cholla s compliance with epa s arizona regional haze rule since we have challenged the rule judicially and are considering our future options with respect to that plant if the rule is upheld 
we are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters  which  depending on their final outcome  could require modification to our environmental expenditures 
distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades  capital replacements  and new customer construction 
examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines  substations  and line extensions to new residential and commercial developments 
capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings  which may include issuances of long term debt and pinnacle west common stock 
financing cash flows and liquidity compared with pinnacle west s consolidated net cash used for financing activities was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of million in net cash used

table of contents critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 
regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in our financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers 
management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction 
this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings 
we had billion of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december  included in the balance of regulatory assets at december  is a regulatory asset of million for pension and other postretirement benefits 
this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings 
if these costs are disallowed by the acc  this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 
see notes and for more information 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term  and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december  reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our reported pension expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on pinnacle west s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

b this assumes a change in the initial and ultimate health care cost trend rate 
see note for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  determines whether we use 
table of contents accrual accounting for derivative instruments designated as normal or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings unless certain hedge criteria are met 
effective june   aps discontinued cash flow hedging for the significant majority of derivative contracts 
aps now defers of changes in fair value on these contracts for future rate treatment in accordance with the psa see note 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis 
see fair value measurements below for additional information on valuation 
see note for discussion on accounting policies and note for a further discussion on derivative accounting 
fair value measurements we account for derivative instruments  investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust  certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we use inputs  or assumptions that market participants would use  to determine fair market value 
the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy 
we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy 
actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value 
see note for discussion on accounting policies and note for further fair value measurement discussion 
other accounting matters see note for discussion regarding amended accounting guidance adopted during relating to fair value measurements and disclosures  and the presentation of comprehensive income 
market and credit risks market risks our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and benefit plan assets 
interest rate and equity risk we have exposure to changing interest rates 
changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note and note and benefit plan assets 
the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and benefit plan assets also have risks associated with the changing market value of its equity and other non fixed income investments 
nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

our risk management committee  consisting of officers and key management personnel  oversees company wide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies 
we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives  including futures  forwards  options and swaps 
as part of our risk management program  we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities
