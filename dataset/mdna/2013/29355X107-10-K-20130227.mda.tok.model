in  the largest customer accounted for approximately of segment revenues 
competition 
major competitors for our engine products and services segment include mtu  caterpillar inc  and wartsila corporation 
price  delivery time  engineering and service support  and engine efficiency relating to fuel consumption and emissions drive competition 
raw materials and components 
our engine products and services segment purchases multiple ferrous and non ferrous castings  forgings  plate stock and bar stock for fabrication and machining into engines 
in addition  we buy a considerable amount of precision machined engine components 
we believe all of these raw materials and components are readily available from various suppliers  but may be subject to long and variable lead times 
research and development the goal of our research and development effort is to strengthen our product portfolios for traditional markets while simultaneously creating distinctive and breakthrough products 
we utilize a process to move product innovations from concept to commercialization  and to identify  analyze  develop and implement new product concepts and opportunities aimed at business growth 
we employ scientists  engineers and technicians throughout our operations to develop  design and test new and improved products 
we work closely with our customers to identify issues and develop technical solutions 
the majority of our research and development spending typically is directed toward the development of new sealing products for the most demanding environments  the development of truck and trailer fleet information systems  the development of bearing products and materials with increased load carrying capability and superior friction and wear characteristics  and the development of engine products to meet current and future emissions requirements while improving fuel efficiencies 
backlog at december   we had a backlog of orders valued at million compared with million at december  approximately of the backlog  almost exclusively at fairbanks morse engine  is expected to be filled beyond backlog represents orders on hand we believe to be firm 
however  there is no certainty the backlog orders will result in actual sales at the times or in the amounts ordered 
in addition  for most of our business  backlog is not particularly predictive of future performance because of our short lead times and some seasonality 

table of contents quality assurance we believe product quality is among the most important factors in developing and maintaining strong  long term relationships with our customers 
in order to meet the exacting requirements of our customers  we maintain stringent standards of quality control 
we routinely employ in process inspection by using testing equipment as a process aid during all stages of development  design and production to ensure product quality and reliability 
these include state of the art cad cam equipment  statistical process control systems  laser tracking devices  failure mode and effect analysis  and coordinate measuring machines 
we are able to extract numerical quality control data as a statistical measurement of the quality of the parts being manufactured from our cnc machinery 
in addition  we perform quality control tests on parts that we outsource 
as a result  we are able to significantly reduce the number of defective parts and therefore improve efficiency  quality and reliability 
as of december   of our manufacturing facilities were iso  qs and or ts certified 
twenty one of our facilities are iso certified 
oems are increasingly requiring these standards in lieu of individual certification procedures  and as a condition of awarding business 
patents  trademarks and other intellectual property we maintain a number of patents and trademarks issued by the us and other countries relating to the name and design of our products and have granted licenses to some of these patents and trademarks 
we routinely evaluate the need to protect new and existing products through the patent and trademark systems in the us and other countries 
we also have unpatented proprietary information  consisting of know how and trade secrets relating to the design  manufacture and operation of our products and their use 
we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent on any particular patent  patent right  trademark  trade secret or license granted or group of related patents  patent rights  trademarks  trade secrets or licenses granted 
in general  we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell 
however  we also license patented and other proprietary technology and processes from various companies and individuals in order to broaden our product offerings 
we are dependent on the ability of these third parties to diligently protect their intellectual property rights 
in several cases  the intellectual property licenses are integral to the manufacture of our products 
for example  fairbanks morse engine licenses technology from man diesel and its subsidiaries for certain of the four stroke reciprocating engines it produces 
the term of the licenses varies by engine type  with one set of licenses currently in the process of being renewed through  while licenses for the remaining engine types have terms  subject to potential renewal  expiring in or a loss of these licenses or a failure on the part of the licensor to protect its own intellectual property could reduce our revenues 
these licenses are subject to renewal and it is possible we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or they could be terminated for a material breach 
if this were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
employees and labor relations we currently have approximately  employees worldwide in our continuing operations 
approximately  employees are located within the us  and approximately  employees are located outside the us  primarily in europe  canada and china 
approximately of our us employees are members of trade unions covered by three collective bargaining agreements with contract termination dates from august to january union agreements relate  among other things  to wages  hours  and conditions of employment 
the wages and benefits furnished are generally comparable to industry and area practices 
our deconsolidated subsidiaries  primarily gst llc  have about  additional employees worldwide 

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the risks stated elsewhere in this annual report  set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  will  could  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terms 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur 
risks related to our business certain of our subsidiaries filed petitions to resolve asbestos litigation 
the historical business operations of certain subsidiaries of our subsidiary  coltec industries inc coltec  principally gst llc and the anchor packing company anchor  have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
those subsidiaries manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products  predominately gaskets and packing products  which contained encapsulated asbestos fibers 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
there is no remaining insurance coverage available to anchor and it has no assets 
our subsidiaries exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers has been actively managed through another coltec subsidiary  garrison litigation management group  ltd 
garrison  collectively with gst llc and anchor  gst 
on the petition date  gst llc  anchor and garrison filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina in charlotte the bankruptcy court to address these claims 
these subsidiaries have been deconsolidated from our financial statements since the petition date 
the amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve the asbestos liabilities of these companies is uncertain 
several risks and uncertainties result from these filings that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
those risks and uncertainties include the following possible changes in the value of the deconsolidated subsidiaries reflected in our financial statements 
our investment in gst is subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
to estimate the fair value  the company considers many factors and uses both discounted cash flow and market valuation approaches 
the company does not adjust the assumption about asbestos claims values from the amount reflected in the liability it recorded prior to the deconsolidation 
the asbestos claims value will be determined in the chapter process  either through negotiations with claimant representatives or  absent a negotiated resolution  by the bankruptcy court after contested proceedings  and accordingly adverse developments with respect to the terms of the resolution of such claims may materially adversely affect the value of our investment in gst  the uncertainty of the number and per claim value of pending and potential future asbestos claims 
on the petition date  according to garrison  there were more than  total claims pending against gst llc  and approximately  claims alleging the disease mesothelioma 
as a result of the initiation of the chapter proceedings  the resolution of asbestos claims is subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and the filing of the chapter cases automatically stayed the prosecution of pending asbestos bodily injury and wrongful death lawsuits  and initiation of new such lawsuits  against gst 
an estimation trial for the purpose of estimating the number and value of allowed mesothelioma claims for plan 
table of contents feasibility purposes has been scheduled for july gst  on the one hand  and the claimants representatives  on the other hand  proposed different approaches to estimating allowed asbestos personal injury claims against gst  and the bankruptcy court ruled that each could present its proposed approach 
gst will offer a merits based approach that focuses on its legal defenses to liability and takes account of claimants recoveries from other sources  including trusts established in chapter cases filed by gst s co defendants  in estimating potential future recoveries by claimants from gst 
we anticipate that the claimants representatives will offer a settlement based theory of estimation 
our recorded asbestos liability as of the petition date was million 
neither we nor gst has endeavored to update the estimate since the petition date except as necessary to reflect payments of accrued fees and the disposition of cases on appeal 
as a result of those necessary updates  the liability estimate as of december  was million 
in each asbestos driven chapter case that has been resolved previously  the amount of the debtor s liability has been determined as part of a consensual plan of reorganization agreed to by the debtor and its creditors  including asbestos claimants and a representative of potential future claimants 
gst does not believe that there is a reliable process by which an estimate of such a resolution can be made and therefore believes that there is no basis upon which it can revise the estimate last updated prior to the petition date  the financial viability of our subsidiaries insurance carriers and their reinsurance carriers  and our subsidiaries ability to collect on claims from them 
agreements with certain of these insurance carriers and the terms of applicable policies define specific annual amounts to be paid or limit the amount that can be recovered in any one year  and accordingly substantial insurance payments for submitted claims have been deferred and are payable in installments through  and an additional million of other insurance payments may be payable only upon the conclusion of the bankruptcy process  the potential for asbestos exposure to extend beyond the filed entities arising from corporate veil piercing efforts or other claims by asbestos plaintiffs 
during the course of the proceedings before the bankruptcy court  the claimant representatives have asserted that affiliates of gst  including the company and coltec  should be held responsible for the asbestos liabilities of gst under various theories of derivative corporate responsibility including veil piercing and alter ego 
claimant representatives filed a motion with the bankruptcy court asking for permission to sue us based on those theories 
in a decision dated june   the bankruptcy court denied the claimant representatives motion without prejudice  thereby potentially allowing the representatives to re file the motion after the estimation trial scheduled for  and the costs of the bankruptcy proceeding and the length of time necessary to resolve the case  either through settlement or various court proceedings 
through december   gst has recorded chapter case related fees and expenses totaling million

our business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and distressed market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the markets in which we sell our products  particularly chemical companies  petroleum refineries  heavy duty trucking  semiconductor manufacturing  capital equipment and the automotive 
table of contents industry  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales  gross margins and net income 
the recent recession affected our results of operations 
a prolonged and severe downward cycle in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our businesses 
customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce inventories 
to remain competitive  we need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we also need to develop new products to continue to meet the needs and desires of our customers 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position 
additionally  some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
certain of our products may also experience transformation from unique branded products to undifferentiated price sensitive products 
this product commoditization may be accelerated by low cost foreign competition 
changes in the replacement cycle of certain of our products  including because of improved product quality or improved maintenance  may affect aftermarket demand for such products 
initiatives designed to distinguish our products through superior service  continuous improvement  innovation  customer relationships  technology  new product acquisitions  bundling with key services  long term contracts or market focus may not be effective 
pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products  we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
our marketing success in the us and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents and distributors sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets 
many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products 
a loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors  or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships  could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
increased costs for raw materials  the termination of existing supply agreements or disruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the prices for some of the raw materials we purchase increased in while we have been successful in passing along some or all of these higher costs  there can be no assurance we will be able to continue doing so without losing customers 
similarly  the loss of a key supplier or the unavailability of a key raw material could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reductions in the us navy s requirements for engines offered by fairbanks morse engine could materially adversely affect the results of our engine products and services segment 
sales of new engines to the us navy by our engine products and services segment  which have been a significant component of that segment s revenues  are based on the us navy s long term ship building programs 
we currently anticipate that the us navy s requirements for new engines of this 
table of contents type are likely to decline  which decline may be exacerbated by any curtailment in military budgets affecting the us navy s ship building programs 
unless we are able to develop alternative markets for new engines  any such decline in demand from the us navy could materially adversely affect the results of our engine products and services segment 
we have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to discontinued operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in any fiscal period 
we have contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations of our predecessors  including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters 
in some instances we have indemnified others against those liabilities  and in other instances we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities 
claims could arise relating to products or other matters related to our discontinued operations 
some of these claims could seek substantial monetary damages 
for example  we could potentially be subject to the liabilities related to the firearms manufactured prior to march by colt firearms  a former operation of coltec  for electrical transformers manufactured prior to may by central moloney  another former coltec operation  and for environmental liabilities associated with the pre operations of crucible steel corporation a k a crucible  inc  a majority owned subsidiary of coltec until coltec has ongoing obligations with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters associated with discontinued operations in connection with coltec s periods of ownership of those operations 
we have insurance  reserves  and funds held in trust to address these liabilities 
however  if our insurance coverage is depleted  our reserves are not adequate  or the funds held in trust are insufficient  environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the us  which subjects us to additional business risks that may cause our profitability to decline 
because we sell our products in a number of foreign countries  we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales of our products outside of the us our international operations are  and will continue to be  subject to a number of risks  including unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse changes in foreign tax  legal and regulatory requirements  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  cultural norms and expectations that may sometimes be inconsistent with our code of conduct and our requirements about the manner in which our employees  agents and distributors conduct business  differing labor regulations  
table of contents political and economic instability  including instabilities associated with european sovereign debt uncertainties and the future continuity of membership of the european union  and acts of hostility  terror or war 
any of these factors  individually or together  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations 
for example  our operations in countries outside the united states are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa  which prohibits united states companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business  direct business to any person or corporate entity  or obtain any unfair advantage 
our activities in countries outside the united states create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the fcpa  even though these parties are not always subject to our control 
we have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs with respect to the fcpa 
however  we cannot assure that our policies  procedures and programs always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents 
in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti corruption laws  including the fcpa  we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions  and we may be subject to other liabilities  which could negatively affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities  which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations 
as we expand our international operations  we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local agents  distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to increase sales in these regions 
failure to properly manage these risks could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
we believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know how  our business and prospects could be negatively impacted 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents  trademarks  service marks  domain names  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality  non compete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights 
patents issued to third parties  whether before or after the issue date of our patents  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
questions as to whether our competitors products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors intellectual property rights may be disputed 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable  limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions 
our competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology 
without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for 
table of contents our intellectual property  our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired  which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue 
as a result  we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions  which could involve certain risks and uncertainties 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges  such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities  properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters  ensuring adequate capital availability and balancing other resource constraints 
there are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions  including difficulties integrating acquired technology  operations  personnel and financial and other systems  unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business  unrealized synergies and cost savings  unknown or underestimated liabilities  diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business 
in addition  internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards 
our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management  operational resources and financial and internal control systems 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business  technology  service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
our business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks  including rising healthcare costs  changes in environmental laws and unforeseen business interruptions 
our business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks 
for example  medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase 
initiatives to address these costs  such as consumer driven health plan packages  may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed 
failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees 
other risks to our business include potential changes in environmental rules or regulations  which could negatively impact our manufacturing processes 
use of certain chemicals and other substances could become restricted or such changes may otherwise require us to incur additional costs which could reduce our profitability and impair our ability to offer competitively priced products 
additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations 
terrorist attacks  natural disasters  political insurgencies  pandemics  information system failures  cybersecurity breaches  and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
a relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers  competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance  as well as industry conditions and general financial  economic and political instability 
because our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods  our stock price may fluctuate 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs 
small 
table of contents declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall 
we may also incur charges to income to cover increases in the estimate of our subsidiaries future asbestos liability 
other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include  but are not limited to demand for our products  the timing and execution of customer contracts  the timing of sales of our products  increases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in applicable tax rates  an impairment in the value of our investment in gst  an impairment of goodwill at our cpi reporting unit or other business  unanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products  announcements by competitors of new products  services or technological innovations  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  raw materials or supplies  product development or administration  major changes in the level of economic activity in major regions of the world in which we do business  costs related to possible future acquisitions or divestitures of technologies or businesses  an increase in the number or magnitude of product liability claims  our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  particularly outside the us  and economic assumptions and market factors used to determine post retirement benefits and pension liabilities 
various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control 
the anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  our shareholder rights plan and provisions of north carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
in particular  our articles of incorporation and bylaws  among other things 
table of contents require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders meetings  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of our convertible debentures 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital 
in addition  a reasonable number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans  including shares to be issued upon the exercise of stock options  vesting of restricted stock or unit grants  and upon conversion of our convertible debentures 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect  if any  that they may have on the market price for our common stock 
the issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur  could adversely affect the trading price of the debentures and the market price of our common stock 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
moreover  our current senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock if availability under the facility falls below million 
as a result  our common stock may be less attractive to certain investors than the stock of companies with a history of paying regular dividends 
risks related to our capital structure our debt agreement imposes limitations on our operations  which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investments and or pursue business opportunities 
we have a senior secured revolving credit facility that imposes limitations on our operations  such as limitations on distributions  limitations on incurrence and repayment of indebtedness  and maintenance of a fixed charge coverage financial ratio if average monthly availability is less than certain thresholds 
these limitations could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investment needs and or pursue business opportunities 
we may not have sufficient cash to fund amounts payable upon a conversion of our convertible debentures or to repurchase the debentures at the option of the holder upon a change of control 
our convertible debentures mature on october  the debentures are subject to conversion when one or more of the conversion conditions specified in the indenture governing the debentures are satisfied 
upon a conversion  we will be required to make a cash payment of up to  for each  in principal amount of debentures converted 
one of these conversion conditions is based on the trading price of our common stock 
the debentures become subject to conversion in the succeeding quarter  upon notice by the holders  when the closing price per share of our common stock exceeds  or of the conversion price of  for at least twenty trading days during 
table of contents the last thirty consecutive trading days of any calendar quarter such amounts are subject to adjustment for specified events as set forth in the indenture 
none of the conversion conditions were satisfied at december   but this particular condition was met during the quarter ended june  no debentures were converted during the subsequent quarter ended september  in addition  upon a change of control  subject to certain conditions  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all outstanding convertible debentures at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including liquidated damages  if any  up to but not including the date of repurchase 
however  we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to settle converted debentures or make repurchases of tendered debentures 
any credit facility in place at the time of a repurchase or conversion of the debentures may also limit our ability to use borrowings to pay any cash payable on a repurchase or conversion of the debentures and may prohibit us from making any cash payments on the repurchase or conversion of the debentures if a default or event of default has occurred under that facility without the consent of the lenders under that credit facility 
our current million senior secured credit facility prohibits distributions from our subsidiaries to us to make payments of principal or interest on the debentures or payments upon conversion of the debentures and prohibits prepayments of the debentures  in each case if a default or event of default exists or if our subsidiaries identified as borrowers under the facility fail to have either a pro forma average borrowing availability under the facility greater than the greater of i the lesser of of a the available borrowing base or b the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the credit facility or ii million or b i pro forma average borrowing availability under the facility greater than the greater of a the lesser of of i the available borrowing base or ii the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the credit facility or b million  and ii a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio that is greater than to our failure to repurchase tendered debentures at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on a conversion of the debentures would constitute a default under the indenture 
a default under the indenture or the change of control itself could lead to a default under the other existing and future agreements governing our indebtedness 
if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the debentures or make cash payments upon conversion thereof 
derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses 
we are party to certain derivative transactions  such as foreign exchange forward contracts and call options hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our convertible debentures  with financial institutions to hedge against certain financial risks 
in light of current economic uncertainty and potential for financial institution failures  we may be exposed to the risk that our counterparty in a derivative transaction may be unable to perform its obligations as a result of being placed in receivership or otherwise 
in the event a counterparty to a material derivative transaction is unable to perform its obligations thereunder  we may experience losses material to our results of operations and financial condition

the historical business operations of certain subsidiaries of our subsidiary  coltec industries inc coltec  principally garlock sealing technologies llc gst llc and the anchor packing company anchor  have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
information about gst llc s asbestos litigation is contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the asbestos subsection of the contingencies section 
on june  the petition date  gst llc  anchor and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
garrison filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina in charlotte the bankruptcy court 
gst llc  anchor and garrison are sometimes referred to collectively as gst in this report 
the filings were the initial step in a claims resolution process 
gst llc is one of the businesses in our broader garlock group 
gst llc and its subsidiaries operate five significant manufacturing facilities  including operations in palmyra  new york and houston  texas 
the filings did not include enpro industries  inc  or any other enpro industries  inc operating subsidiary 

table of contents gst llc now operates in the ordinary course under court protection from asbestos claims 
all pending litigation against gst is stayed during the process 
we address our actions to permanently resolve gst llc s asbestos litigation in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
section 
the financial results of gst and subsidiaries are included in our consolidated results through june   the day prior to the petition date 
however  us generally accepted accounting principles require an entity that files for protection under the us bankruptcy code  whether solvent or insolvent  whose financial statements were previously consolidated with those of its parent  as gst s and its subsidiaries were with ours  generally must be prospectively deconsolidated from the parent and the investment accounted for using the cost method 
at deconsolidation  our investment was recorded at its estimated fair value as of june   resulting in a gain for reporting purposes 
the cost method requires us to present our ownership interests in the net assets of gst at the petition date as an investment and not recognize any income or loss from gst and subsidiaries in our results of operations during the reorganization period 
our investment of million as of december  and  was subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
when gst emerges from the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court  the subsequent accounting will be determined based upon the applicable facts and circumstances at such time  including the terms of any plan of reorganization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for condensed financial information of gst and subsidiaries 
during   and  we completed a number of acquisitions and a disposition of a business 
please refer to acquisitions and dispositions in item business for additional discussion regarding these transactions 
we completed our required annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  the estimated fair value of our cpi reporting unit  included in our engineered products segment  exceeded its book value by and in and  respectively 
there is million of goodwill allocated to cpi 
the fair value of the cpi reporting unit was calculated using both discounted cash flow and market valuation approaches 
the key assumptions used for the discounted cash flow approach include business projections  growth rates  and a discount rate of 
the discount rate we use is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
for the market approach  we chose a group of companies we believe are representative of our diversified industrial peers 
we used a weighting for the discounted cash flow valuation approach and a weighting for the market valuation approach  reflecting our belief that the discounted cash flow valuation approach provides a better indicator of value since it reflects the specific cash flows anticipated to be generated in the future by the business 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point increase in the discount rate would result in this reporting unit exceeding its book value by 
conversely  a basis point decrease in the discount rate would result in this reporting unit exceeding its book value by 
the future cash flows modeled for cpi are dependent on certain cost savings restructuring initiatives and a customer focused organizational realignment  both launched in non recurring restructuring expenses in were million 
in addition  approximately million of labor and facilities cost was removed from our future cost structure 
the customer focused organizational realignment during was critical to price and volume opportunities identified while developing the forecast 
while there is uncertainty associated with the customer price and volume opportunities  only a portion of these opportunities were forecasted in the future cash flow model utilized for goodwill impairment testing 

table of contents finally  we are dependent on the strength of our customers and their respective industries to achieve sales forecasted for except for  which is based on a detailed forecast  the remaining years in the cash flow model are based on the forecast  adjusted for assumed macro economic forecasts for industrial production changes at each of our major geographic markets per the dupont economic outlook as of september since our products serve a variety of industries  industrial production is a good indicator for demand changes for our products and services 
the nominal growth rates for and beyond  are approximately   and for north america  europe  and asia  respectively 
management believes that all assumptions used were reasonable based on historical operating results and expected future trends 
however  if future operating results are unfavorable as compared with forecasts  the results of future goodwill impairment evaluations could be negatively affected 
we determined all other reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of carrying values and there were no subsequent indicators of impairment through december  outlook although there are indications our markets may improve in the second half of  we expect conditions encountered in the second half of to persist into the first half of in the first quarter of  we expect sales and segment profit to be less than they were in the first quarter of  when activity in our markets and demand for our products were significantly above current levels 
sales will benefit from the inclusion of motorwheel in the first quarter  however  we anticipate that benefit will be more than offset by soft demand from the markets served by the sealing products and engineered products segments and lower sales in the engine products and services segment 
since we do not currently anticipate shipping any engines under the completed contract revenue recognition method in the first quarter of  we expect engine products and services sales to be to below the first quarter of  when four engines were shipped under the completed contract revenue recognition method 
we expect segment profit margins in the first quarter of will reflect lower volumes and a less profitable product mix in the sealing products segment 
we believe conditions may improve in our industrial markets by the second half of however  we anticipate any growth in sales to those markets will be offset by a decline in full year sales in the engine products and services segment 
although we currently expect the segment to ship a higher number of engines in than was shipped in  revenues for these engines will be recognized only under percentage of completion accounting 
we expect the segment s full year sales to decline by about in comparison to our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
based on the expected mix of domestic and foreign earnings  we anticipate our effective tax rate to remain lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the earnings in lower rate foreign jurisdictions 
in the us  we benefit from certain tax incentives such as the deduction for domestic production activities  and credits for research and development 
discrete tax events may cause our effective rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
certain events  including  for example  acquisitions and other business changes  which are difficult to predict  may also cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate 
we are subject to changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions 
corporate tax reform continues to be a priority in the us and other jurisdictions 
changes to the tax system in the us could have significant effects  positive and negative  on our effective tax rate  and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in january  the united states congress passed the american taxpayer relief act of which retroactively extended various tax provisions applicable to the company 
as a result  we expect 
table of contents that our income tax provision for the first quarter of will include a tax benefit which will significantly reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the annual effective tax rate for the irs completed the field examination for our   and us federal income tax returns during the third quarter of  which resulted in incremental taxes payable of million and tax expense of million 
as a result of the irs s conclusion of its field examination  we reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions by million to reflect amounts determined to be effectively settled  which lowered income tax expense by million 
finally  we recorded million of additional income tax expense related to the tax return filed in the third quarter of although the irs fieldwork was completed with respect to the   and tax returns  we disagreed with and protested certain adjustments included in the audit results 
while these audit years remain open  the only items under appeal that are not considered to be effectively settled relate to our deconsolidated gst operations 
no further recognition of income tax expense or benefit to the company s results is expected  however  should there ultimately be an assessment against the combined tax group the company would be responsible for payment and then seek a reimbursement from gst  which may be classified as a noncurrent receivable 
the company believes the position will be sustained  and the entire as filed tax return amount has been recognized 
should the position be lost  additional taxes of approximately million  plus potential interest and penalties  would become payable 
our us defined benefit plans continue to be underfunded 
based on currently available data  which is subject to change  we estimate we will be required to make contributions to the us defined benefit plans in totaling approximately million 
we expect contributions to non us defined benefit plans to be insignificant 
additional significant cash contributions to the us defined benefit plans are likely to be required in and beyond 
future contribution requirements depend on pension asset returns  pension valuation assumptions  plan design  and legislative actions 
in july  the president signed the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map 
although map reduced short term minimum pension contribution requirements in and  we expect additional significant cash contributions to be required in and beyond 
we estimate that annual gaap pension expense in will be million  which is million less than in the decrease in pension expense is primarily due to the strong performance of the pension assets  partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate used in the actuarial computations 
in connection with our growth strategy  we will continue to evaluate acquisitions in  however  the effect of such acquisitions cannot be predicted and therefore is not reflected in this outlook 
we address our outlook on our actions to permanently resolve gst llc s asbestos litigation in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd

table of contents acquired in august and included in the engineered products segment and the mid western group of companies mid western acquired in february and included in engineered products segment 
the reported us dollar value of sales was lower than last year due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
this was primarily the result of a weakening euro  as compared to the us dollar 
garlock and technetics in the sealing products segment and ggb and cpi in the engineered products segment have significant operations in europe 
segment profit  management s primary measure of how our operations perform  increased to million in from million in earnings from acquisitions contributed million while selected price increases generated million 
these favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations of million  an increase in restructuring costs of million  volume reductions of million and higher sg a costs 
corporate expenses for declined by million compared to the decline was driven by a decrease in employee incentive compensation of million  offset by higher consulting and management expenses of million and higher directors share based compensation of million 
net interest expense in was million compared to million in the increase in net interest expense was caused primarily by higher borrowings on the senior secured revolving credit facility

in the us  we historically have benefited from federal income tax incentives such as the deduction for domestic production activities and credits for research and development 
however  as of december   certain tax incentives expired and were not renewed before the end of these include the research and experimentation credit  certain employment credits  and an exclusion for passive income earned by controlled foreign corporations 
in january  the united states congress passed the american taxpayer relief act atra of which retroactively extended these tax provisions 
the effective tax rate above reflects the tax law that was in place as of december  had the atra been enacted prior to january   our overall tax expense would have been approximately million  resulting in an overall effective tax rate of

following is a discussion of operating results for each segment during the year sealing products 
sales of million in were higher than the million reported in the increase in sales includes percentage points due to the acquisitions of tara million  motorwheel million  and psi million and one percentage point due to price 
table of contents increases 
these increases were partially offset by a two percentage point decline in sales due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
segment profit increased to million in from million in acquisitions contributed million toward the increase in segment profit  primarily due to tara million and motorwheel million and selected net price increases contributed million 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of million and an unfavorable change in volume and mix of million 
selling  general  and administrative costs increased by million  driven mainly by increased payroll costs and travel 
operating margins for the segment declined to in from in engineered products 
sales of million in were lower than the million reported in sales volumes were down a net six percentage points due primarily to declines in european automotive and industrial manufacturing segments at ggb and continued weak demand at cpi in european industrial and refining markets and in certain north american markets  including the natural gas region of western canada  these unfavorable changes in sales were partially offset by improvements in china and australia 
unfavorable foreign exchange rates hurt segment sales by four percent  or million 
the acquisitions of pi bearings million and mid western million in favorably affected sales by percentage points 
selected price increases also contributed two percent to segment sales 
segment profit in was million  down by million from million in segment profit was negatively impacted by million  primarily as a result of a decline in sales volumes 
in addition  increased restructuring costs of million and unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations of million  as compared to  were also unfavorable to segment profit 
selected price increases  net of higher costs  contributed million to segment profit and decreases in selling  general  and administrative costs contributed an additional million to segment profits 
operating margins for the segment were in  which declined from the reported last year 
engine products and services 
sales increased to million in from million in  due primarily to an increase in engine revenue of eight percent 
although engines were shipped in each year  revenue for eight of the engines shipped in was recognized over the past months under percentage of completion accounting  which began in the third quarter of for new engine programs 
revenues for six engines shipped in and all engines shipped in were accounted for under the completed contract method 
sales of aftermarket parts in the government and nuclear generation industries contributed six percentage points to the increased sales 
new environmental upgrade products  developed in late  generated two percent in additional sales  partially offset by lower service revenue 
the segment reported a profit of million in compared to million in segment profit improved by million due to higher engine revenue 
in addition  the segment recorded a million estimated warranty expense in to repair a specific engine component in a series of us navy ships 
the segment also recorded a million estimated loss on an engine contract in these large costs during were partly offset by benefits booked in the same period of related to reimbursements on the canceled south texas project nuclear business of million and the favorable resolution of a legal matter amounting to million 
operating margins increased to in from in compared to sales of  million in increased from million in the following table illustrates the effects of key factors resulting in the change in sales by segment 
table of contents sales percent change vs 
increase decrease acquisitions foreign currency engine revenue other total enpro industries  inc sealing products n a engineered products n a engine products services sales from acquisitions completed in and contributed about percentage points to the increase 
in addition  sales increased as a result of higher volumes in the sealing products and engineered products segments as we captured improvements in in nearly all of our customer markets 
selected price increases we instituted in also contributed to the increase in sales compared to sales in the engine products and services segment grew primarily due to shipping more engines  with higher average revenue per engine  and incremental revenue related to using the percentage of completion accounting method beginning in the third quarter of changes in foreign exchange rates added two percentage points to the sales increase 
sales in included gst llc through the petition date while sales in excluded gst llc s sales for the full year as a result of the deconsolidation of gst llc effective on the petition date 
sales from gst llc to third parties in through the petition date were million 
segment profit  management s primary measure of how our operations perform  increased to million in from million in earnings from acquisitions completed in and contributed about six percentage points to the improvement 
segment profit also increased due to the higher volumes in the sealing products and engineered products segments  especially in engineered products  while price increases in these segments essentially offset net cost increases in compared to these year over year improvements were reduced by the deconsolidation of gst llc effective on the petition date 
segment profit in included gst llc through the petition date while segment profit in excluded gst llc s operating income for the full year as a result of the deconsolidation of gst llc effective on the petition date 
segment profit for gst llc in through the petition date was million 
the improvements in the sealing products and engineered products segments were partially offset by the decline in earnings in the engine products and services segment caused by lower margins on the higher engine shipments  a decrease in higher margin parts and services revenue  and provisions for a warranty matter and an anticipated contract loss 
segment operating margins were lower also due to the inclusion of acquired businesses with lower than average margins as compared to the other businesses in the segment 
changes in foreign exchange rates added two percentage points to the segment profit increase 
as a result of these changes  segment margins  defined as segment profit divided by sales  declined from in to in excluding the engine parts and services segment  segment margins declined only slightly from in to in corporate expenses for declined by million compared to primarily due to lower medical expenses  directors share based compensation  and consulting expenses partially offset by higher salary and management s incentive compensation expenses 
net interest expense in was million compared to million in the increase in net interest expense was caused primarily by the deconsolidation of gst and the inclusion of interest expense on notes payable to gst llc in our results  which previously was eliminated in our consolidated results 
we also incurred interest expense in on new borrowings on the senior secured revolving credit facility

in connection with the deconsolidation of gst  we recorded a pre tax gain of million in the gain is discussed in the garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we recorded an income tax expense of million on pre tax income from continuing operations of million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate in was lower than the us statutory rates  primarily due to the earnings in lower rate foreign jurisdictions 
in the us  we also benefited from certain tax incentives such as the deduction for domestic production activities and credits for research and development 
during  our effective tax rate was as we recorded an income tax expense of million on pre tax income from continuing operations of million

following is a discussion of operating results for each segment during the year sealing products 
sales of million in were higher than the million reported in the increase in sales included percentage points due to the acquisitions of psi million  tara million  and rome tool die million 
increases in volume  reflecting improved markets and increased market share  plus selected net price increases since were essentially offset by the sales decrease caused by the deconsolidation of gst 
sales from gst llc to third parties in through the petition date were million 
the consolidated garlock operations experienced improved demand in several markets including oil and gas  and rubber products  and in europe and asia 
technetics group demand was higher in in most markets and in several product lines 
stemco reported large increases in oem about  brake products about  and aftermarket demand about and prices increased about 
favorable foreign exchange rates contributed about two percentage points to the sales increase 
segment profit of million in increased compared to the million reported in despite higher volumes  some contribution from the acquisitions  and price increases  which nearly offset all cost increases  garlock earnings declined because of the deconsolidation of gst llc effective on the petition date 
segment profit for gst llc in through the petition date was million 
earnings at technetics increased in compared to  but the increase was less than the improvement in sales because of lower incremental earnings at the acquired businesses 
stemco reported an increase in profit in connection with its higher volumes  including its acquired business  which was reduced by cost increases in excess of selected price increases in operating margins for the stemco brake products acquisition in were lower than the historical business 
operating margins for the segment decreased to in from in 
table of contents engineered products 
sales of million in were higher than the million reported in the increase in sales included percentage points due to the acquisitions of cc technology  progressive equipment  and premier lubrication systems million  mid western million and pi bearing technologies million 
in addition  sales for ggb and cpi in increased million as both operations continued to capture higher volume from improvements in several markets and million due to selected price increases 
favorable foreign exchange rates contributed million or four percentage points to the segment s sales growth 
the segment profit in was million  which was higher than the million reported in increased profits at ggb and cpi came primarily from higher volumes of million and selected price increases of million  partially offset by cost increases of million in materials and sg a 
acquisitions completed in and added million to the increase and changes in foreign exchange rates added million 
operating margins for the segment were in  which improved from the reported in engine products and services 
sales increased from million in to million in sales increased million due to shipping engines in versus engines in  with a higher average price per engine in due to the types of engines shipped 
additionally  the engine products and services segment also recognized incremental revenue of million related to using the percentage of completion accounting method for new or nearly new engine programs beginning in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decline in parts and services revenue in the segment reported a profit of million in compared to million in a lower margin mix of engine shipments in  the decrease in higher margin aftermarket parts and services activity  and net cost increases contributed to the decrease in segment profit 
in addition  the segment recorded a million estimated warranty expense to repair a specific engine component in a series of us navy ships 
the segment also recorded a million estimated loss on an engine contract 
the expected contract loss was a result of detrimental changes in the market for nuclear power plant emergency power engines after the tsunami in japan  which caused costs per nuclear related engine to be higher than expected  and the original engine costs for the program were underestimated 
these large costs were partially offset by cost reimbursements related to the canceled south texas project of approximately million  which reduced expenses in the third quarter of  the favorable resolution of a legal matter  amounting to million  and approximately million of incremental profit related to the use of percentage of completion accounting beginning in the third quarter of operating margins dropped from in to in restructuring and other costs restructuring expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
during  we initiated a number of restructuring activities throughout our operations  the most significant of which were at our garlock  ggb and cpi businesses 
at both garlock and cpi  we consolidated several of our north american manufacturing operations and service centers into other existing sites 
at ggb  we reduced the size of our workforce  primarily in europe  as activity slowed in their markets 
in addition  ggb also shut down their fluid film bearing product line  which began as a new product development effort a few years ago 
ultimately  the product did not prove to be commercially viable  and we made the decision to shut down production 
workforce reductions announced as a result of our restructuring activities totaled salaried administrative and hourly manufacturing positions  most of which had been terminated by december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash requirements for  but not limited to  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  pension contributions  and debt repayments have been funded from cash balances on hand  revolver borrowings and cash generated from operations 
we are proactively pursuing acquisition opportunities 
it is possible our cash requirements for one or more of these acquisition opportunities could exceed our cash balance at the time of closing 
should we need additional capital  we have other resources available  which are discussed in this section under the heading of capital resources 
as of december   we held no cash and cash equivalents in the united states and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents outside of the united states 
if the funds held outside the united states were needed for our operations in the us  we have several methods to repatriate without significant tax effects  including repayment of intercompany loans or distributions of previously taxed income 
other distributions may require us to incur us or foreign taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash to fund our us operations 
cash flows operating activities provided million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows in versus was primarily attributable to a significant increase in working capital in of million as compared to a million decrease in working capital needs in remained relatively constant with the levels at the end of lower cash taxes paid of approximately million also contributed to higher cash provided by operating activities in as compared to the lower cash taxes paid included million of tax refunds in from overpayments in and million in tax overpayments in applied to the increase in operating cash flows in versus was primarily attributable to our increased earnings and the tax payment resulting from the gain on the sale of quincy compressor made in  which did not recur in  partially offset by higher contributions to the us defined benefit plans in in and  gst reported million and million of operating cash flows  respectively  which were not included in our results 
we used million  net  and million  net  in and  respectively  and received million  net  in  for investing activities

in  we used million net of cash acquired to purchase six businesses 
please refer to acquisitions and dispositions in part i  item business for additional discussion regarding these transactions 
we also spent million for capital expenditures across all of our businesses 
the net cash inflow provided by investing activities in resulted from the proceeds of the divestiture of quincy compressor 
this cash receipt was partially offset by capital expenditures and the cash retained by gst llc and its subsidiaries in connection with their deconsolidation

under certain conditions  we may request an increase to the facility maximum availability by up to million to million in total 
any increase is dependent on obtaining future lender commitments for those amounts  and no current lender has any obligation to provide such commitment 
the credit facility matures on july   unless  prior to that date  our convertible debentures are paid in full  refinanced on certain terms  or defeased  in which case the facility will mature on march  borrowings under the credit facility are secured by specified assets of ours and our us operating subsidiaries  other than gst llc  and primarily include accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  certain real property  deposit accounts  intercompany loans  intellectual property and related contract rights  general intangibles related to any of the foregoing and proceeds related to the foregoing

we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures to enter into call options  ie  hedge and warrant transactions  which entitle us to purchase shares of our stock from a financial institution at per share and entitle the financial institution to purchase shares of our stock from us at per share 
this will reduce potential dilution to our common stockholders from conversion of the debentures and have the effect to us of increasing the conversion price of the debentures to per share

the goal of the process is an efficient and permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims through court approval of a plan of reorganization  which is expected to establish a trust to which all asbestos claims will be channeled for resolution 
gst intends to seek an agreement with asbestos claimants and other creditors on the terms of a plan for the establishment of such a trust and repayment of other creditors in full  or in the absence of such an agreement an order of the bankruptcy court confirming such a plan 
prior to its deconsolidation effective on the petition date  gst llc and its subsidiaries operated as part of the garlock group of companies within enpro s sealing products segment 
gst llc designs  manufactures and sells sealing products  including metallic  non metallic and composite material gaskets  rotary seals  compression packing  resilient metal seals  elastomeric seals  hydraulic components  and expansion joints 
gst llc and its subsidiaries operate five primary manufacturing facilities  including gst llc s operations in palmyra  new york and houston  texas 
garrison s principal business historically has been to manage the defense of all asbestos related litigation affecting the company s subsidiaries  principally gst llc and anchor  arising from their sale or use of products or materials containing asbestos  and to manage  bill and collect available insurance proceeds 
when it commenced business in  garrison acquired certain assets of gst llc and assumed certain liabilities stemming from asbestos related claims against gst llc 
garrison is not itself a defendant in asbestos related litigation and has no direct liability for asbestos related claims 
rather  it has assumed gst llc s liability for such claims and agreed to indemnify gst llc from liability with respect to such claims 
anchor was a distributor of products containing asbestos and was acquired by gst llc in anchor has been inactive and insolvent since the financial results of gst and subsidiaries have been excluded from our consolidated results since the petition date 
the investment in gst is presented using the cost method during the reorganization period and is subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
the cost method requires us to present our ownership interests in the net assets of gst at the petition date as an investment and to not recognize any income or loss from gst and subsidiaries in our results of operations during the reorganization period 
when gst emerges from the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court  the subsequent accounting will be determined based upon the applicable circumstances and facts at such time  including 
table of contents the terms of any plan of reorganization 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for condensed financial information for gst and subsidiaries 
gst s third party sales and operating income from the date of deconsolidation through december   were million and million  respectively 
gst is included in our consolidated us federal income tax return and certain state combined income tax returns 
as the parent of these consolidated tax groups  we are liable for  and pay  income taxes owed by the entire group 
we have agreed with gst to allocate group taxes to gst based on the us consolidated tax return regulations and current accounting guidance 
this method generally allocates current and deferred taxes to gst as if it were a separate taxpayer 
as a result  we carry an income tax receivable from gst related to this allocation 
at december   this amount was approximately million 
this receivable is expected to be collected in the future  subject to gst s reorganization and the terms thereof 
as a result of the deconsolidation of gst  we conducted an analysis to compare the fair market value of gst to its book value 
based on this analysis  we recognized a million non cash pre tax gain on the deconsolidation of gst in the second quarter of the fair value of gst  net of taxes on the gain on deconsolidation  was recorded at million 
our million investment value is subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
gst will be presented using the cost method during the reorganization period 
we have assessed gst llc s and garrison s liquidity position as a result of the bankruptcy filing and believe they can continue to fund their operating activities  and those of their subsidiaries  and meet their capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  the ability of gst llc and garrison to continue as going concerns is dependent upon their ability to resolve their ultimate asbestos liability in the bankruptcy from their net assets  future cash flows  and available insurance proceeds  whether through the confirmation of a plan of reorganization or otherwise 
as a result of the bankruptcy filing and related events  there can be no assurance the carrying values of the assets  including the carrying value of the business and the tax receivable  will be realized or that liabilities will be liquidated or settled for the amounts recorded 
in addition  a plan of reorganization  or rejection thereof  could change the amounts reported in the gst llc and garrison financial statements and cause a material change in the carrying amount of our investment 
for additional information about gst s bankruptcy proceeding  see note to our consolidated financial statements and the sections entitled contingencies subsidiary bankruptcy  and asbestos in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
dividends to date  we have not paid dividends and we do not intend to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future 
if availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility falls below million  we would be limited in our ability to pay dividends 
as of december and throughout  we exceeded this minimum threshold 
the indenture that governs the convertible debentures does not restrict us from paying dividends 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities 
note  overview  significant accounting policies and recently issued pronouncements  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies 
table of contents used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical 
some of them involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time title and risk of product ownership is transferred or when services are rendered with the exception of engine revenue recognition in the engine products and services segment as described in the next three paragraphs 
shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue and expensed in cost of goods sold 
during the third quarter of  the engine products and services segment began using percentage of completion poc accounting for new and nearly new engine contracts rather than the completed contract method 
we made this change because  as a result of enhancements to the financial management and reporting systems  the segment is able to reasonably estimate the revenue  costs  and progress towards completion of engine builds 
if we are not able to meet those conditions for a particular engine contract  the segment will recognize revenues using the completed contract method 
progress towards completion is measured by reference to costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total project costs 
recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions during the engine build period in the event the assumptions regarding the overall contract outcome are revised 
the cumulative effect of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such a revision becomes likely and estimable 
losses on contracts in progress are accounted for in the period a loss becomes likely and estimable 
we recognized revenues and operating income of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   and revenues and operating income of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  on contracts accounted for under the poc method 
the engine products and services segment will continue to use the completed contract method for engines in production at june  there has been no change in the revenue recognition policy for engine products and services parts and services revenue or for the sealing products or engineered products segment 
asbestos through the petition date  gst accrued a liability for known and estimated future expenditures to resolve asbestos claims for subsequent ten year periods and recorded legal fees and expenses only when incurred 
the significant assumptions underlying the material components of the estimated liability included the number and trend of claims asserted  the mix of alleged diseases or impairment  the trend in the number of claims for malignant cases  primarily mesothelioma  the probability some existing and potential future claims would eventually be dismissed without payment  the estimated amount to be paid per claim  and the timing and impact of large amounts available for the payment of claims from the g trusts of former defendants in bankruptcy 

table of contents with the assistance of bates white  a recognized expert  we periodically reviewed the period over which we could make a reasonable estimate  the assumptions underlying the estimate  the range of reasonably possible potential liabilities and management s estimate of the liability  and adjusted the estimate if necessary 
additional discussion is included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in contingencies asbestos 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we have entered into contracts to hedge forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies occurring at various dates through december we account for these contracts as derivatives 
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  we designate the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
changes in the value of a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability  while changes in the value of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
pensions and postretirement benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and assumed health care cost trend rates 
assumptions are determined based on data available to us and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a material effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated statements of operations  as well as amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pension and postretirement benefits 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
temporary differences arising between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet are used to calculate future income tax assets or liabilities 
this method also requires the recognition of deferred tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income losses in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on its technical merits 
if the recognition threshold for the tax position is met  only the portion of the tax benefit that we believe is greater than percent likely to be realized is recorded 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
goodwill and other intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill  but instead it is subject to annual impairment testing 
the goodwill asset impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step of comparing the implied fair 
table of contents value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill is required to measure the potential goodwill impairment loss 
there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows which require management to apply judgment to the analysis of intangible asset impairment  including projecting revenues  interest rates  cost of capital  royalty rates and tax rates 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments

contingencies general a detailed description of certain environmental  asbestos and other legal matters relating to certain of our subsidiaries is included in this section 
in addition to the matters noted herein  we are from time to time subject to  and are presently involved in  other litigation and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe the outcome of such other litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
expense for administrative and legal proceedings are recorded when incurred 
environmental our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the us and foreign countries 
we take a proactive approach in our efforts to comply with environmental  health and safety laws as they relate to our operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we also regularly conduct comprehensive environmental  health and safety audits at our facilities to maintain compliance and improve operational efficiency 
although we believe past operations were in substantial compliance with the then applicable regulations  we or one of our subsidiaries is involved at sites where the cost per site for us or our subsidiary is expected to exceed thousand 
investigations have been completed for sites and are in progress at the other four sites 
our costs at a majority of these sites relate to remediation projects for soil and groundwater contamination at former operating facilities that were sold or closed 
as of december  and  enpro had accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  for estimated future expenditures relating to environmental contingencies 
given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws  regulations  enforcement policies  the impact of other parties potentially being liable  technology and information related to individual sites  we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities 
in addition  based on our prior ownership of crucible steel corporation a k a crucible  inc crucible  we may have additional contingent liabilities in one or more significant environmental matters  which are included in the sites referred to above 
except with respect to specific crucible environmental matters for which we have accrued a portion of the liability set forth above  we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss related to these contingent liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our environmental contingencies and see the section titled crucible steel corporation a k a crucible  inc in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents colt firearms and central moloney we may have contingent liabilities related to divested businesses for which certain of our subsidiaries retained liability or are obligated under indemnity agreements 
these contingent liabilities include  but are not limited to  potential product liability and associated claims related to firearms manufactured prior to march by colt firearms  a former operation of coltec  and for electrical transformers manufactured prior to may by central moloney  another former coltec operation 
we believe that these potential contingent liabilities are not material to the company s financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
coltec also has ongoing obligations  which are included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of these operations 
crucible steel corporation a k a crucible  inc crucible steel corporation a k a crucible  inc crucible  which was engaged primarily in the manufacture and distribution of high technology specialty metal products  was a wholly owned subsidiary of coltec until when its assets and liabilities were distributed to a new coltec subsidiary  crucible materials corporation 
coltec sold a majority of the outstanding shares of crucible materials corporation in and divested its remaining minority interest in crucible materials corporation filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in may and is no longer conducting operations 
we have certain ongoing obligations  which are included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  including workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters  related to coltec s period of ownership of crucible 
based on coltec s prior ownership of crucible  we may have certain other contingent liabilities  including liabilities in one or more significant environmental matters included in the matters discussed in environmental  above 
we are investigating these matters 
except with respect to those matters for which we have an accrued liability as discussed in environmental above  we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss related to these contingent liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain liabilities relating to coltec s ownership of crucible 
subsidiary bankruptcy three of our subsidiaries filed voluntary chapter bankruptcy petitions on the petition date as a result of tens of thousands of pending and estimated future asbestos personal injury claims 
the filings were the initial step in a claims resolution process 
the goal of the process is an efficient and permanent resolution of all pending and future asbestos claims through court approval of a plan of reorganization that will establish a trust to which all asbestos claims will be channeled for resolution and payment 
in november  gst filed a proposed plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court 
the proposed plan calls for a trust to be formed  to which gst and affiliates would contribute million and which would be the exclusive remedy for future asbestos personal injury claimants those whose claims arise after confirmation of the plan 
the proposed plan provides that each present personal injury claim any pending claim or one that arises between the petition date and plan confirmation will be assumed by reorganized gst and resolved either by settlement pursuant to a matrix contained in the proposed plan or as otherwise agreed  or by payment in full of any judgment entered after trial in federal court 
based on a preliminary estimate provided by bates white  the estimation expert retained by counsel to gst  prior to the time that gst filed its proposed plan  gst estimates that the indemnity costs to resolve all present claims pursuant to the settlement matrix in the plan would cost reorganized gst approximately million 
under the proposed plan  all non asbestos claimants would be paid the full value of their claims 
gst s proposed plan is opposed by the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the claimants committee and the future claimants representative the fcr and together with the claimants committee  claimant representatives and is unlikely to be approved in its 
table of contents current form 
the claimant representatives have announced their intention to file a competing proposed plan of reorganization 
update 
on april   the bankruptcy court granted a motion by gst for the bankruptcy court to estimate the allowed amount of present and future asbestos claims against gst for mesothelioma  a rare cancer attributed to asbestos exposure  for purposes of determining the feasibility of a proposed plan of reorganization 
the court has tentatively scheduled the estimation trial to begin in july gst and the claimants committee and fcr have proposed different approaches to estimating allowed asbestos personal injury claims against gst  and the bankruptcy court ruled that each could present its proposed approach 
gst will offer a merits based approach that focuses on its legal defenses to liability and takes account of claimants recoveries from other sources  including trusts established in chapter cases filed by gst s co defendants  in estimating potential future recoveries by claimants from gst 
we anticipate that the claimants committee and fcr will offer a settlement based theory of estimation 
during the course of the chapter proceedings  the claimant representatives have asserted that affiliates of the filed entities  including the company and coltec  should be held responsible for the asbestos liabilities of the filed entities under various theories of derivative corporate responsibility including veil piercing and alter ego 
claimant representatives filed a motion with the bankruptcy court asking for permission to sue us based on those theories 
in a decision dated june   the bankruptcy court denied the claimant representatives motion without prejudice  thereby potentially allowing the representatives to re file the motion after the estimation trial scheduled for we believe there will be no reason for the claimant representatives to re file the motion because the derivative claims will likely be moot after the estimation trial  as we believe that the estimation trial will result in an estimate of aggregate liability for asbestos claims that gst is capable of fully funding 
from time to time during the case we have engaged in settlement discussions with asbestos claimant representatives and we anticipate that we will continue to do so  however  there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached and  if so  when that might occur 
from the petition date through december   gst has recorded chapter case related fees and expenses totaling million 
the total includes million for fees and expenses of gst s counsel and experts  million for fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the asbestos claimants committee  and million for the fees and expenses of the future claims representative and his counsel and experts 
gst recorded million of those case related fees and expenses in compared to million in  and million in gst attributes the large year over year increase to increased activity in the case  including activity related to discovery disputes  the identification and preparation of experts for estimation  and claimant representatives efforts to extend gst s liability to affiliates 
see the additional information provided earlier under the heading garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd  the discussion under the heading asbestos  which follows  and notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
asbestos background on asbestos related litigation 
the historical business operations of gst llc and anchor resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs alleged that exposure to asbestos fibers in products produced or sold by gst llc or anchor  together with products produced and sold by numerous other companies  contributed to the bodily injuries or deaths 
gst llc and 
table of contents anchor manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products that contained encapsulated asbestos fibers 
other of our subsidiaries that manufactured or sold equipment that may have at various times in the past contained asbestos containing components have also been named in a number of asbestos lawsuits  but only gst llc and anchor have ever paid an asbestos claim 
since the first asbestos related lawsuits were filed against gst llc in  gst llc and anchor have processed more than  claims to conclusion  and  together with insurers  have paid over billion in settlements and judgments and over million in fees and expenses 
our subsidiaries exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers have been managed through garrison 
beginning in  the top tier asbestos defendants companies that paid most of the plaintiffs damages because they produced and sold huge quantities of highly friable asbestos products sought bankruptcy protection and stopped paying asbestos claims in the tort system 
the bankruptcies of many additional producers of friable asbestos products followed 
the plaintiffs could no longer pursue actions against these large defendants during the pendency of their bankruptcy proceedings  even though these defendants had historically been determined to be the largest contributors to asbestos related injuries 
many plaintiffs pursued gst llc in civil court actions to recover compensation formerly paid by top tier bankrupt companies under state law principles of joint and several liability and began identifying gst llc s non friable sealing products as a primary cause of their asbestos diseases  while generally denying knowledge of exposure to the friable products of companies in bankruptcy 
gst llc believes this targeting strategy effectively shifted damages caused by top tier defendants that produced friable asbestos products to gst llc  thereby materially increasing gst llc s cost of defending and resolving claims 
almost all of the top tier defendants that sought bankruptcy relief in the early s have now emerged  or are positioning to emerge  from bankruptcy 
their asbestos liabilities have been assumed by wealthy g trusts created in the bankruptcies with assets contributed by the emerging former defendants and their affiliates 
with the emergence of these companies from bankruptcy  many plaintiffs seek compensation from the g trusts 
these trusts have aggregate assets exceeding billion billion at september   according to a study released in september by the united states government accountability office specifically set aside to compensate individuals with asbestos diseases caused by the friable products of those defendants 
we believe that as billions of dollars of g trust assets continue to become available to claimants  defendants will obtain significant reductions in their costs to defend and resolve claims 
as of the petition date  however  the establishment of these g trusts had taken longer than anticipated and the trusts had a significant backlog of claims that accumulated while the trusts were being established 
additionally  procedures adopted for the submissions of asbestos claims in bankruptcy cases and against g trusts make it difficult for gst llc and other tort system co defendants to gain access to information about claims made against bankrupt defendants or the accompanying evidence of exposure to the asbestos containing products of such bankrupt defendants 
we believe that these procedures enable claimants to double dip by collecting payments from remaining defendants in the tort system under joint and several liability principles for injuries caused by the former top tier defendants while also collecting substantial additional amounts from g trusts established by those former defendants to pay asbestos claims 
because of these factors  while several g trusts had begun making substantial payments to claimants prior to the petition date  gst llc had not yet experienced a significant reduction in damages being sought from gst llc 
subsidiary chapter filing and its effect 
in light of gst llc s experience that a its cost of defending and resolving claims had not yet declined as anticipated although g trusts had begun making substantial payments to claimants  and b new mesothelioma claims filings against it in recent years had not declined at a rate similar to the rate of decline in disease incidence  gst initiated voluntary 
table of contents proceedings under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as a means to determine and comprehensively resolve their asbestos liability 
the filings were the initial step in an ongoing claims resolution process 
during the pendency of the chapter proceedings  certain actions proposed to be taken by gst not in the ordinary course of business will be subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
as a result  during the pendency of these proceedings  we will not have exclusive control over these companies 
accordingly  as required by gaap  gst was deconsolidated beginning on the petition date 
as a result of the initiation of the chapter proceedings  the resolution of asbestos claims is subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court 
the filing of the chapter cases automatically stayed the prosecution of pending asbestos bodily injury and wrongful death lawsuits  and initiation of new such lawsuits  against gst 
further  the bankruptcy court issued an order enjoining plaintiffs from bringing or further prosecuting asbestos products liability actions against affiliates of gst  including enpro  coltec and all their subsidiaries  during the pendency of the chapter proceedings  subject to further order 
as a result  the numbers of new claims filed against our subsidiaries and  except as a result of the resolution of appeals from verdicts rendered prior to the petition date and information about pending cases obtained in the chapter proceedings  the numbers of claims pending against them have not changed since the petition date  and those numbers continue to be as reported in our form k and our quarterly reports for the first and second quarters of see the section entitled subsidiary bankruptcy in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information and an update on the gst asbestos claims resolution process 
pending claims 
on the petition date  according to garrison  there were more than  total claims pending against gst llc  and approximately  claims alleging the disease mesothelioma 
mesothelioma is a rare cancer of the protective lining of many of the body s internal organs  principally the lungs 
the primary cause of mesothelioma is believed to be exposure to asbestos 
as a result of asbestos tort reform during the s  most active asbestos related lawsuits  and a large majority of the amount of payments made by our subsidiaries  have been as a result of claims alleging mesothelioma 
in total  gst llc has paid million to resolve a total of  mesothelioma claims  and another  mesothelioma claims have been dismissed without payment 
in order to estimate the allowed amount for mesothelioma claims against gst  the bankruptcy court approved a process whereby all current gst llc mesothelioma claimants were required to respond to a questionnaire about their claims 
questionnaires were distributed to the mesothelioma claimants identified in garrison s claims database 
many of the  claimants over did not respond to the questionnaire at all  many others more than  acknowledged that they do not have mesothelioma  that they cannot establish exposure to gst products  or that their claims were dismissed  settled or withdrawn 
still others responded to the questionnaire but their responses are deficient in some material respect 
as a result of this process  less than  claimants have presented questionnaires asserting mesothelioma claims against gst llc as of the petition date and many of them have not established exposure to gst products or have claims that are otherwise deficient 
since the petition date  many asbestos related lawsuits have been filed by claimants against other companies in state and federal courts  and many of those claimants might also have included gst llc as a defendant but for the bankruptcy injunction 
many of those claimants likely will make claims against gst in the bankruptcy proceeding 
product defenses 
we believe that the asbestos containing products manufactured or sold by gst could not have been a substantial contributing cause of any asbestos related disease 
the asbestos in the products was encapsulated  which means the asbestos fibers incorporated into the products during the 
table of contents manufacturing process were sealed in binders 
the products were also nonfriable  which means they could not be crumbled by hand pressure 
the us occupational safety and health administration  which began generally requiring warnings on asbestos containing products in  has never required that a warning be placed on products such as gst llc s gaskets 
even though no warning label was required  gst llc included one on all of its asbestos containing products beginning in further  gaskets such as those previously manufactured and sold by gst llc are one of the few asbestos containing products still permitted to be manufactured under regulations of the us environmental protection agency 
nevertheless  gst llc discontinued all manufacture and distribution of asbestos containing products in the us during and worldwide in mid appeals 
gst llc has a record of success in trials of asbestos cases  especially before the bankruptcies of many of the historically significant asbestos defendants that manufactured raw asbestos  asbestos insulation  refractory products or other dangerous friable asbestos products 
however  it has on occasion lost jury verdicts at trial 
gst has consistently appealed when it has received an adverse verdict and has had success in a majority of those appeals 
we believe that gst llc will continue to be successful in the appellate process  although there can be no assurance of success in any particular appeal 
at december   three gst llc appeals are pending from adverse decisions totaling million 
gst llc won reversals of adverse verdicts in one of two recent appellate decisions 
in september  the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit overturned a thousand verdict against gst llc that was handed down in by a kentucky federal court jury 
the federal appellate court found that gst llc s motion for judgment as a matter of law should have been granted because the evidence was not sufficient to support a determination of liability 
the sixth circuit s chief judge wrote that  on the basis of this record  saying that exposure to garlock gaskets was a substantial cause of 
claimant s 
mesothelioma would be akin to saying that one who pours a bucket of water into the ocean has substantially contributed to the ocean s volume 
in may  a three judge panel of the kentucky court of appeals upheld gst llc s thousand share of a jury verdict  which included punitive damages  in a lung cancer case against gst llc in kentucky state court 
this verdict  which was secured by a bond pending the appeal  was paid in june insurance coverage 
at december   we had million of insurance coverage we believe is available to cover current and future asbestos claims payments and certain expense payments 
gst has collected insurance payments totaling million since the petition date 
of the million of available insurance coverage remaining  we consider million to be of high quality because the insurance policies are written or guaranteed by us based carriers whose credit rating by s p is investment grade bbb or better  and whose am best rating is excellent a or better 
we consider million to be of moderate quality because the insurance policies are written with various london market carriers 
of the million  million is allocated to claims that were paid by gst llc prior to the initiation of the chapter proceedings and submitted to insurance companies for reimbursement  and the remainder is allocated to pending and estimated future claims 
there are specific agreements in place with carriers covering million of the remaining available coverage 
based on those agreements and the terms of the policies in place and prior decisions concerning coverage  we believe that substantially all of the million of insurance proceeds will ultimately be collected  although there can be no assurance that the insurance companies will make the payments as and when due 
the million is in addition to the million collected in based on those agreements and policies  some of which define specific annual amounts to be paid and others of which limit the amount that can be recovered in any one year  we anticipate that million will become collectible at the conclusion of gst s chapter proceeding and  assuming the insurers pay according to the agreements and policies  that the following amounts should be collected in the years set out below regardless of when the case concludes 
table of contents million million million million million million in addition  gst llc has received million of insurance recoveries from insolvent carriers since including million in and may receive additional payments from insolvent carriers in the future 
no anticipated insolvent carrier collections are included in the million of anticipated collections 
the insurance available to cover current and future asbestos claims is from comprehensive general liability policies that cover coltec and certain of its other subsidiaries in addition to gst llc for periods prior to and therefore could be subject to potential competing claims of other covered subsidiaries and their assignees 
liability estimate 
our recorded asbestos liability as of the petition date was million 
we based that recorded liability on an estimate of probable and estimable expenditures to resolve asbestos personal injury claims under generally accepted accounting principles  made with the assistance of garrison and an estimation expert  bates white  retained by gst llc s counsel 
the estimate developed was an estimate of the most likely point in a broad range of potential amounts that gst llc might pay to resolve asbestos claims by settlement in the majority of the cases except those dismissed or tried over the ten year period following the petition date in the state court system  plus accrued but unpaid legal fees 
the estimate  which was not discounted to present value  did not reflect gst llc s views of its actual legal liability  gst llc has continuously maintained that its products could not have been a substantial contributing cause of any asbestos disease 
instead  the liability estimate reflected gst llc s recognition that most claims would be resolved more efficiently and at a significantly lower total cost through settlements without any actual liability determination 
neither we nor gst has endeavored to update the accrual since the petition date except as necessary to reflect payments of accrued fees and the disposition of cases on appeal 
after those necessary updates  the liability accrual at december  was million 
in each asbestos driven chapter case that has been resolved previously  the amount of the debtor s liability has been determined as part of a consensual plan of reorganization agreed to by the debtor and its creditors  including asbestos claimants and a representative of potential future claimants 
gst does not believe that there is a reliable process by which an estimate of such a resolution can be made and therefore believes that there is no basis upon which it can revise the estimate last updated prior to the petition date 
in addition  we do not believe that we can make a reasonable estimate of a specific range of more likely outcomes with respect to the asbestos liability of gst  and therefore  while we believe it to be an unlikely worst case scenario  gst s ultimate costs to resolve all asbestos claims against it could range up to the total value of gst 
in a proposed plan of reorganization filed by gst and opposed by claimant representatives  gst has proposed to resolve all pending and future claims 
gst has estimated that the amounts to be paid into the trust created by the plan for payments to future claimants  plus the indemnity costs incurred under the plan to pay present claimants  would be approximately million 
see the section entitled subsidiary bankruptcy in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
claimant representatives  on the other hand  have asserted that gst s liability exceeds the value of gst 
the proposed plan of reorganization includes provisions that would resolve any and all alleged derivative claims against us based on gst asbestos products 
the provisions specify that we would fund million of the amount proposed to be paid into the trust to pay future claimants and would guarantee 
table of contents the obligations of gst under the plan 
those provisions are incorporated into the terms of the proposed plan only in the context of the specifics of that plan  which would result in the equity interests of gst being retained by gst s equity holder  the reconsolidation of gst into the company with substantial equity above the amount of equity currently included in our consolidated financial statements  and an injunction protecting us from future gst claims 
we cannot predict when a plan of reorganization for gst might be approved and effective  however an estimation trial for the purpose of determining the number and value of allowed mesothelioma claims for plan feasibility purposes has been tentatively scheduled for july we believe that gst will present compelling defenses at the estimation trial that  among other things  gst s products could not have been a substantial contributing cause of any asbestos related disease 
therefore  gst believes the amounts that will be paid under its proposed plan would be far more than sufficient to fully fund its actual legal liability 
there are many potential hurdles to plan confirmation  including appeals  that could arise during and after the estimation trial 
quantitative claims and insurance information 
our recorded asbestos liability at the petition date was million
