ii part i item business description of business overview arrowhead research corporation is a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted rnai therapeutics 
the company is leveraging its proprietary drug delivery technologies to develop drugs based on the rna interference mechanism that efficiently silences disease causing genes 
these platforms have yielded several drug candidates under internal and partnered development 
arrowhead technologies also enable partners to create peptide drug conjugates that specifically home to cell types of interest while sparing off target tissues 
arrowhead s pipeline includes clinical programs in chronic hepatitis b virus and partner based programs in obesity and oncology 
lead product candidate arc is an rnai based therapeutic designed to treat chronic hepatitis b virus hbv infection 
it is the first drug candidate from arrowhead s dynamic polyconjugate sirna delivery platform 
it is designed to treat chronic hbv infection by reducing the expression and release of new viral particles and key viral proteins with the goal of achieving a functional cure 
the company completed its planned enrollment in a phase clinical trial in and expects to begin a phase a trial in the first half of and a phase b trial in the second half of platform technologies the dynamic polyconjugate dpc platform is a small rna delivery system that may be targeted to address multiple organ systems and cell types 
it is a modular system that may be optimized on a target by target basis and has been demonstrated to promote multi log gene knockdown  induce efficient endosomal escape  and has a favorable safety profile using a variety of sirna molecules 
arrowhead s homing peptides platform is a vast  proprietary library of short peptides that have demonstrated rapid and specific internalization into a wide variety of cell types 
this library is being mined for the potential targeting of rnai therapeutics using the dpc delivery system as well as to enable partners to target traditional small molecule or peptide drugs 
pipeline development strategy arrowhead s internal drug pipeline is intended to drive value directly through the clinical development of novel therapeutics and to provide proof of concept for our platform technologies 
our core areas of focus for expanding our internal pipeline of rnai therapeutics are develop intravenous iv administered liver targeted candidates  develop subcutaneously administered liver targeted candidates  and explore extra hepatic targets  including oncology 
we actively seek collaboration and licensing agreements with leading biopharmaceutical companies to augment their pipelines through the application of our technologies and to advance the development and commercialization of our own technology platforms and drug candidates 
partnerships are intended to provide access to external expertise and capital to complement our internal development and create commercialization opportunities in areas outside of our core focus 
recent events arrowhead made significant progress on product and platform development during fiscal and focused our resources on advancing targeted rnai therapeutics based on the dpc delivery system 
the following are highlights of this progress published data showing first ever cholesterol sirna mediated gene knockdown in primates using a novel dpc co injection strategy  strengthened our balance sheet and expanded our institutional shareholder base with equity financings totaling million in gross proceeds since the period ended september   signed a collaboration and license agreement with shire ag providing them access to the homing peptide technology to develop peptide targeted therapeutics for a rare disease target  strategically focused internal resources on expanding our pipeline of dpc enabled rnai therapeutics  while terminating development of the rondel delivery platform and its clinical candidate  calaa  published preclinical data showing that a single injection of arc induces multi log reductions of viral rna  proteins  and viral dna  expanded patent protection of arc and dpc platform extending through  presented data on arc at the annual meeting of the american association for the study of liver diseases aasld demonstrating reduction of key hbv antigens and dna  and evidence of immune reactivation in a chimpanzee with chronic hbv infection  completed planned enrollment in a phase clinical trial indicating arc is generally safe and well tolerated at all six dose levels studied  enabling the company to proceed with its plans to initiate a phase a clinical trial  submitted for ethics and regulatory permission to initiate a phase a pilot efficacy clinical trial in chronic hbv patients  and advanced our preclinical pipeline of rnai therapeutics to include a lead program against an orphan liver disease 
acquisition of roche rnai business the last few years have brought substantial change to arrowhead s research and development r d capabilities and strategy 
we have transitioned from being a nanotechnology holding company in multiple industries to a focused biotech model 
we are now a unified rnai therapeutics company  developing novel drugs that silence disease causing genes based on our broad rnai and peptide technology platforms 
the most significant step in this transition was our acquisition of roche s rnai therapeutics business  which included the dynamic polyconjugate  or dpc  delivery system that we use in our hepatitis b drug candidate  arc roche built this business unit in a manner that only a large pharmaceutical company is capable of backed by expansive capital resources  they systematically acquired technologies  licensed expansive ip  attracted leading scientists  developed new technologies internally  and built state of the art facilities 
at a time when the markets were questioning whether rnai could become a viable therapeutic modality  we saw great promise in the technology broadly and the quality of what roche built specifically 
the acquisition provided us with three primary sources of value broad freedom to operate within three sirna formats  canonical  meroduplex  and dicer substrate sirna structures  best in class small rna delivery system  the targetable dpc platform  and a state of the art r d facility in madison  wisconsin  including a large team of scientists experienced in rnai and sirna delivery 
we see this as a powerful combination of intellectual property  r d infrastructure  and rnai delivery experts 
it provided us with the tools we needed to build an independent and broad rnai company 
we believe we are the only company with access to all three sirna structures and this enables us to optimize the rnai trigger on a target by target basis 
our dpc delivery system enables us to deliver sirna efficiently to hepatocytes and non hepatic tissues in a highly specific manner 
our r d team and facility enable rapid innovation and drive to the clinic  as evidenced by the speed at which we have advanced the arc program 
as we look at the rnai space  we do not see any company with as powerful and complete a combination of assets and capabilities as ours 
we have made great strides since the acquisition 
we brought arc into the clinic  completed a phase trial  and we are in the process of initiating a phase trial 
additionally  we have made important advances in the dpc delivery technology 
this includes new generations of dpcs capable of inducing deep and durable gene knockdown with various constructs designed for both iv and subcutaneous administration 
a key to dpc s potency  and one of its differentiating qualities  is a polymer backbone designed to induce efficient endosomal escape 
this allows more of the sirna to get into the cytosol where it can engage the cell s rnai machinery 
we have also taken advantage of our dpc s targetable nature and have made substantial progress toward extra hepatic delivery 
delivering outside the liver is important for maximizing the value of dpcs and to continue to differentiate arrowhead from its competitors 
toward those ends  we have active programs to identify and evaluate targeting ligands that may be used with dpcs 
as part of this initiative  in april we acquired alvos therapeutics  a privately held company that licensed a large platform of proprietary human derived homing peptides from md anderson cancer center 
this library contains peptides discovered through screening in human patients  and we are actively determining whether we could use these peptides to target dpcs 
we have focused our resources behind the dpc platform and our focus is entirely on advancing arc through the clinic and developing additional dpc enabled rnai therapeutics 
additionally  arrowhead now has the infrastructure  expertise  ip portfolio  and management that we believe is necessary to attract and support a broad range of partnerships and research collaborations with large biopharma companies from discovery stage through clinical trials 
pipeline overview our internal preclinical and clinical development programs are designed to create value directly through our proprietary candidates 
these programs also drive value to the technology platforms as proof of concept for the power of the programs to enable innovative new therapies 
logo internal clinical program arc hepatitis b virus infection according to the world health organization  million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis b virus  of which  to  people die each year from hbv related liver disease 
chronic hbv infection is defined by the presence of hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag for more than months 
in the immune tolerant phase of chronic infection  which can last for many years  the infected person typically produces very high levels of viral dna and viral antigens 
however  the infection is not cytotoxic and the carrier may have no symptoms of illness 
over time  the ongoing production of viral antigens causes inflammation and necrosis  leading to elevation of liver enzymes such as alanine and aspartate transaminases  hepatitis  fibrosis  and liver cancer hcc 
if untreated  as many as to of chronic carriers develop cirrhosis or hcc 
antiviral therapy is generally prescribed when liver enzymes become elevated 
the current standard of care for treatment of chronic hbv infection is a daily oral dose of nucleotide nucleoside analogs nucs or a regimen of interferon injections to times weekly for approximately one year 
nucs are generally well tolerated  but patients may need lifetime treatment because viral replication often rebounds upon cessation of treatment 
interferon therapeutics can result in a functional cure in of some patient types  but treatment is often associated with significant side effects  including severe flu like symptoms  marrow suppression  and autoimmune disorders 
logo we see the need for a next generation hbv treatment with fewer side effects  that eliminates the need for interferon based treatment  has a finite treatment period and an attractive dosing regimen  and one that can be used at earlier stages of disease 
we believe a novel therapeutic approach that can effectively treat or provide a functional cure development of patient antibodies against hbsag has the potential to take significant market share and may expand the available market to include patients that are currently untreated 
arc is an sirna therapeutic intended for delivery to the active site of infection using our proprietary dynamic polyconjugate dpc technology 
arc consists of two sirna duplexes  each conjugated to a cholesterol derivative to enhance liver delivery and cellular uptake 
we have designed arc to be co administered with an active excipient  a masked  hepatocyte targeted polymeric amine 
once the sirnas and the active excipient are taken up by the hepatocytes  the polymeric amines are unmasked in the endosome and disrupt the endosomal membrane  releasing the sirna to the cytoplasm where it can engage the rnai machinery of the cell 
the sirnas in arc are designed to target multiple components of hbv production including the pregenomic rna that would be reverse transcribed to generate the viral dna 
the sirnas intervene at the mrna level  upstream of where nucs act  and target the mrnas that produce hbsag proteins  the viral polymerase  the core protein that forms the capsid  the pre genomic rna and the hbeag 
nucs are effective at reducing production of viral particles  but are ineffective at controlling production of viral antigens and other hbv gene products 
a reduction of viral antigens is considered necessary to effective therapy because their presence is thought to be a major contributor to repression of the immune system and the persistence of liver disease secondary to hbv infection 
chronic hbv untreated logo arc versus nuc intervention logo logo efficacy data in mouse models of hbv infection show that arc is capable of reducing hbsag by greater than log  hbv dna by approximately logs  and hbeag to the limit of detection 
pharmacologic effects persist for approximately one month after a single dose of arc safety data in rodents and non human primates indicate an acceptable safety margin 
logo additional preclinical data in a chimpanzee chronically infected with hbv demonstrate that intravenous administration of two doses mg kg on day  and mg kg on day of arc  resulted in substantial and sustained reductions in hbv dna  hbeag  and hbsag  which did not return to baseline until study day   and  respectively 
in addition  an increase in serum alanine transaminase alt occurred weeks after the second dose  coincident with the nadir of circulating hbsag 
this is suggestive of a therapeutic immunological flare  which is thought to be part of a cascade that under chronic therapy may lead to hbsag seroconversion and functional cure 
observed increases in key chemokine cytokine mrnas are also consistent with a t cell mediated immunological event 
arrowhead completed its planned enrollment in a phase trial in the fall of the study was designed to characterize the safety profile of arc across a range of doses and evaluate pharmacokinetics 
it was a single center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  single dose escalation  first in human study of arc administered intravenously to healthy adult volunteers 
all subjects received either placebo or arc in doses ranging from mg kg to mg kg 
the study was planned to enroll subjects in six cohorts of six subjects each  with subjects receiving placebo and receiving arc the study successfully enrolled all subjects received arc  placebo at a single center in melbourne  australia 
all subjects received their full  assigned dose and there were no discontinuations for adverse events or otherwise 
based on pre clinical studies  including glp toxicology  it is expected that if any clinically significant or dose limiting toxicities were to occur  they would be observed within the first hours after administration  and would be apparent in elevations in blood chemistries 
the anticipated organs of interest for potential toxicity and the resultant chemistries are liver alt  kidney creatinine  urea  and muscle ck  ast  ldh  troponin i 
in the phase study  laboratory results have not indicated any organ toxicity involving the liver  kidney  or muscle in any subject 
there have been no serious or severe adverse events reported in any subject 
overall  adverse events have been consistent with those typically seen in normal volunteer studies  including in placebo subjects 
the most common events reported were upper respiratory infection  which were not unexpected as the trial was enrolled during the australian winter  and headache 
the only other event reported in more than one subject was mild lightheadedness 
neither occurrence was accompanied by any changes in vital signs  laboratories or physical examinations 
adverse events appear to have been randomly scattered across all six dosing groups with no apparent dose related increases in occurrence rate or severity with the possible exception of mild lightheadedness 
both subjects with mild lightheadedness were in the mg kg group 
laboratory abnormalities have occurred sporadically across groups and time points pre and post dosing 
none of these indicate any organ toxicity and the frequency and severity do not appear to be dose related 
in the first half of  arrowhead plans to conduct a phase a multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  dose escalation study to determine the depth and duration of hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag reduction after a single intravenous dose of arc in combination with entecavir in patients with chronic hbv infection 
the company has conducted combination studies in mouse models of hbv  and arc appears to have at least additive and possibly a synergistic effect with entecavir 
we also believe that a patient population with adequately controlled viral load  but uncontrolled antigenemia may provide us with a clear signal of arc s activity 
chronic dose glp toxicology studies are underway to support a phase b study planned to begin in the second half of that study is planned to have clinical sites in the us  western europe  asia  and potentially other regions 
partner based pipeline logo adipotide obesity and metabolic disorder adipotide has been developed by our majority owned subsidiary  ablaris therapeutics  inc ablaris 
arrowhead owns of the fully diluted shares of ablaris 
adipotide is based on the homing peptide library developed at md anderson cancer center  the licensor  which is also funding and managing a phase clinical trial 
patient recruiting is on going  and though internal resources are not being expended on this program  the company continues to monitor its progress to determine whether it can be an attractive licensing candidate 
an investigational new drug application ind for adipotide was filed with the fda  and patient enrollment began in as part of a phase clinical trial to test the safety of the compound in human patients 
our collaborator  md anderson cancer center in houston  plans to enroll up to obese prostate cancer patients in the phase study and has agreed to bear all direct costs of this trial 
up to five dose levels of the drug candidate will be tested in the trial 
three participants will be enrolled at each dose level  with the first group of participants receiving the lowest dose level by injection under the skin once per day for days and each new group receiving a higher dose than the group before it  if no intolerable side effects are seen 
this will continue until the highest tolerable dose is found or the study terminates 
cyclosert and crlx formerly it the linear cyclodextrin based drug delivery platform  cyclosert  was designed for the delivery of small molecule drugs 
in december  we completed a phase trial with it  a conjugate of the linear cyclodextrin polymer and camptothecin  a potent anti cancer drug  with a positive safety profile and indications of efficacy 
in june  we entered into a transaction with cerulean pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held boston  massachusetts based company 
cerulean licensed rights to further research and commercialize it now known as crlx  and the cyclosert platform for all products except for nucleic acids  tubulysin  cytolysin and second generation epothilones 
in connection with the transaction  we assigned certain patents to cerulean and cerulean granted back to us rights necessary to research and commercialize the excluded products 
we received an initial payment of million  and may receive development and sales milestones  and royalty payments if crlx or other products based on the cyclosert platform are successfully developed 
should cerulean sublicense crlx to a third party  we are entitled to receive a percentage of any sublicensing income at rates between and  depending on the stage of the drug s development at the time of sublicensing 
cerulean has multiple active phase trials ongoing to study crlx in several cancer types  including metastatic stomach  gastroesophageal  esophageal  small cell lung  ovarian  tubal  peritoneal  and renal cell 
alnylam pharmaceuticals in january  arrowhead granted alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc  alnylam a license to utilize the dynamic polyconjugate delivery technology for a single rnai therapeutic product 
alnylam is collaborating with arrowhead to develop this technology for an undisclosed target in its alnylam x pipeline  which is focused on genetically defined targets and diseases 
alnylam has not publically disclosed what progress  if any  it may have made with respect to this target 
arrowhead is eligible to receive milestone payments up to million and royalties on sales from alnylam 
shire in december  arrowhead signed a research collaboration and license agreement with shire ag to develop and commercialize targeted peptide drug conjugates pdcs utilizing arrowhead s human derived homing peptide platform and shire s therapeutic payloads 
arrowhead may receive research funding and could be eligible for development  regulatory  and commercialization milestone payments of up to million for each development candidate  plus additional milestone payments for a second indication  and royalties on worldwide sales 
preclinical programs in addition to our clinical candidates and our partner based programs  we are actively engaged in the discovery and development of additional pre clinical stage products 
our lead preclinical program is a dpc enabled rnai therapeutic targeting an undisclosed orphan liver disease 
we have additional discovery and preclinical programs for intravenous and subcutaneous administered therapeutics targeting the liver  as well as programs targeting extra hepatic tissues 
we focus on disease targets that are well suited for intervention with targeted rnai therapeutics using our dpc delivery platform 
these may include liver disease  oncology  and other therapeutic areas 
rnai program in october  arrowhead acquired roche s rnai business  including its rna therapeutic assets  related intellectual property and research facility in madison  wisconsin 
we believe that these assets position arrowhead as one of the most advanced and broadest rnai therapeutics companies in the world 
arrowhead possesses the following sirna assets non exclusive license from alnylam to use canonical sirnas in oncology  respiratory diseases  metabolic diseases and certain liver diseases 
this includes a sub license from isis pharmaceuticals granting arrowhead a license for sirna chemical modifications for these specific disease areas 
non exclusive license from city of hope comprehensive cancer center to dicer substrate and meroduplex sirnas 
the dicer technology may provide advantages over canonical sirnas in certain circumstances 
in addition  different sirna formats may trigger rnai more or less efficiently on a target by target basis 
patent estate covering the dynamic polyconjugate sirna delivery system 
access to certain patents on targeting sirna drugs with antibodies and small molecules 
state of the art laboratory facilities in madison  wisconsin  managed by long term leaders in oligonucleotide therapeutics and delivery  including a small animal research facility and an offsite primate colony 
intellectual property covering roche s internally developed liposomal nanoparticle drug delivery technology 
we believe this represents one of the broadest sirna drug technology and delivery portfolios in the field 
rna interference the benefits of sirna therapeutics rna interference rnai is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene  thereby affecting the production of a specific protein 
deemed to be one of the most important recent discoveries in life science with the potential to transform medicine  the discoverers of rnai were awarded a nobel prize in for their work 
mediated by small interfering rnas sirna  rnai based therapeutics can leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to potentially target and shut down specific disease causing genes 
small molecule and antibody drugs have proven effective at inhibiting certain cell surface  intracellular  and extracellular targets 
however  certain drug targets such as intranuclear genes and some proteins have proven difficult to inhibit with traditional drug based and biologic therapeutics 
developing effective drugs for these targets would have the potential to address large underserved markets for the treatment of many diseases 
using the ability to specifically silence any gene  rnai therapeutics may be able to address previously undruggable targets  unlocking the market potential of such targets 
mechanism of rna interference logo advantages of rnai as a therapeutic modality silences the expression of disease causing genes  potential to address any target in the transcriptome including previously undruggable targets  rapid lead identification  high specificity  opportunity to use multiple rna sequences in one drug product for synergistic silencing of related targets  and sirnas are uniquely suited for personalized medicine through target and cell specific delivery and gene knockdown 
addressing the sirna delivery challenge to date  the primary challenge to the development of sirna therapeutics has been delivering the fragile  often immunogenic and otherwise rapidly cleared sirna molecules  into the cytoplasm of the cell  where rnai activity occurs 
this hurdle has prevented sirna therapeutics from reaching full potential 
many companies have attempted to overcome the delivery challenge 
most early systems involved cholesterol conjugates or liposomes 
however  development in humans has been limited due to toxicity and immunogenicity of these approaches when studied in clinical trials 
to address the delivery challenge  arrowhead has a leading team of researchers with extensive sirna therapeutic know how and an advanced delivery system 
the dpc system is modular and may be optimized on a target by target basis 
importantly  it also may be targeted to address a variety of tissues  including those outside of the liver 
the dynamic polyconjugate sirna delivery system the dpc delivery system represents an innovative solution to the sirna delivery problem  specifically designed to overcome barriers to systemic administration of sirna 
developed by our scientists in madison  wisconsin  the inspiration for dpc technology came from the physical characteristics of viruses  nature s own nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery 
viruses are efficient at finding their target cells and delivering their nucleic acid payload to the proper cellular compartment 
key features of viruses are their small size  their overall negative surface charge  their specificity for particular cell types based on receptors unique to that cell  and their ability to disassemble and release their nucleic acid cargo to the proper cell compartment in response to cellular triggers 
all of these features are incorporated into dpc technology 
dpcs are small nanoparticles  nanometers nm in size  with an amphipathic polymer backbone 
arrowhead has a library of polymers that may be employed with the system  enabling optimization based on factors such as preferred mode of administration  pharmacokinetics  and target tissue 
shielding agents such as polyethylene glycol and targeting ligands may be reversibly attached to the polymer backbone 
in some constructs  the sirna payload is attached to the dpc  while in other constructs  the sirna circulates attached to a different carrier 
when attached  the dpc construct protects the sirna payload while allowing the polymer to circulate in the blood without creating undue toxicity 
the targeting ligand guides it to the cell of interest where  together with the sirna  it is taken up into a membrane enclosed cellular compartment known as an endosome 
the polymer is selected for its ability to disrupt the endosomal membrane  which allows the sirna to be released into the cytoplasm 
there  it engages the cell s rnai machinery  ultimately resulting in knockdown of target gene expression 
this lytic chemistry of the dpc polymeric backbone is modified  or masked  using proprietary chemistry 
masking of the polymer s lytic chemistry accomplishes two interrelated objectives that are critical to in vivo sirna delivery reduction of toxicity by controlling when the membrane lytic property of the polymer is activated 
inhibition of non specific interactions with blood components and non targeted cell types 
single molecule dpcs logo dpcs using co injection strategy arrowhead has developed multiple forms of the prototypical dpc delivery system 
our arc clinical candidate utilizes a formulation where the sirna is conjugated to cholesterol and is not attached to the dpc 
pre clinical studies have shown co injection of liver targeted dpc polymer together with sirna conjugated to a lipophilic moiety  such as cholesterol  results in a fold increase in the potency when compared to the sirna cholesterol alone 
this formulation retains the potent endosomal escape capabilities of arrowhead dpc platform  simplifies drug manufacturing  and creates new targeting opportunities 
logo dpcs for subcutaneous administration a dpc formulation for subcutaneous administration has also been developed using arrowhead s latest proprietary polymer masking technology 
using dpcs to deliver sirna  high level target gene knockdown is observed at low sirna doses with limited toxicity in rodents and non human primates 
arrowhead studies have shown knockdown of in monkeys after a single injection of mg kg  at mg kg  and in mice at mg kg  which represents greater knockdown at lower doses than reported results of other clinical candidates 
pk and biodistribution studies indicate that the new masking technology is highly stable  allowing for maximal bioavailability and long circulation times 
arrowhead is developing this formulation for use in multiple therapeutic areas where chronic dosing may be required 
homing peptide program in april  arrowhead acquired alvos therapeutics  inc alvos 
alvos licensed a discovery platform and large library of proprietary human derived homing peptides from the md anderson cancer center 
this discovery platform is designed to identify targeting agents  such as peptides  that selectively accumulate in primary and metastatic tumors  associated vasculature  and to normal tissue types 
such targeting agents are of interest for drug development because they hold the promise of shepherding drugs into specific cells while sparing others 
this new platform was acquired because it fit well into our existing business 
one of the key advantages of our dpc delivery systems is its ability to be targeted 
with a vast proprietary targeting library of our own  we believe that we can enhance the value of our rnai programs and differentiate our capabilities from those of our competitors 
in addition  we believe that the homing peptide sequences can be applied to non rna therapeutics almost as a by product of our work targeting rnai drugs and present attractive value to potential partners 
the platform has the potential to allow partners to develop therapeutic agents that hunt down and destroy known tumors  as well as distant unidentified metastases  convert cancer therapeutics that generally interact with most cells in the body to smart drugs that accumulate primarily at tumor sites and affect cancer cells preferentially  thereby improving the toxicity and side effects of currently used cancer drugs  and selectively target non cancer therapeutics to virtually any tissue type in the body where they can have the desired pharmacologic effect 
this platform is potentially powerful in the specificity of the large number of unique targeting sequences and in their origin from human screening 
in addition  because of the human based identification process  there is lower risk that animal model data will not translate 
our proprietary library of  unique targeting sequences can be used with our own delivery platforms  as well as with small molecule drugs 
this platform has achieved clinical proof of concept in targeting metastatic prostate cancer with the first sequence tested in humans 
importantly  the method used identifies peptides that are rapidly internalized into cells 
these peptide receptor pairs hold the promise of shuttling therapeutic payloads preferentially and directly into those cells 
the ability to target and deliver cytotoxins would address some of the problems with current cancer therapeutics by limiting side effects and increasing efficacy 
in order to discover receptors and peptide sequences that target them  a technique called in vivo phage display is employed 
over the past several years  phage display screening has been conducted at md anderson cancer center in end stage cancer patients with primary and metastatic tumors under rigorous ethical standards 
to our knowledge  they are the only group in the world that is generating this type of human derived data 
direct screening in human cancer patients has the potential to eliminate some of the uncertainty that has plagued current discovery methods with animal models 
this strategy sought to map the human vasculature into zip codes and has discovered a large number of novel receptors that are expressed only on the cell surface of tumor sites and nowhere else 
the library can be increased further through continuing work with md anderson to screen additional patients 
arrowhead is working to apply this technology to targeting our proprietary sirna delivery vehicles 
our dpc delivery platform is highly attractive in part because it has been shown to be well tolerated  effective  capable of delivering rnas to multiple organ systems  and it is targetable 
the homing peptide library provides our targeted rnai therapeutic program with a powerful new source of flexibility 
the library is also valuable to enable partners  through license and collaboration deals  to create a new class of therapeutics  peptide drug conjugates  or pdcs 
by linking the homing peptides to traditional small molecule drugs  potential partners may be able to transform a therapeutic that interacts with most cells in the body into one that interacts preferentially with the cell of choice 
we believe that this transition from untargeted to targeted drugs is a paradigm shift for cancer therapeutics and that our new library puts us at the forefront of this transformation 
we do not currently intend to build our own pipeline of pdcs  but do intend to work with partners to apply our targeting sequences to their drugs 
we believe that this specific targeting will enable partners to make existing generics safer and more effective and help make their proprietary drugs better 
given the large number of approved apis for oncology and the thousands of homing peptide sequences that we now have  there are many potential combinations of targeting sequence and drug molecules 
pdcs share the promise of the original class of guided therapeutics  antibody drug conjugates or adcs  in that they could increase efficacy and decrease toxicity relative to current standard of care oncology products 
benefits of pdcs as a class are as follows they are potentially faster  cheaper  and simpler to make than adcs  making them attractive development projects for biopharmaceutical companies  their targets are expressed on a high percentage of multiple tumor types  giving them a larger potential commercial market than genetically targeted agents that are efficacious in only a small subset of patient populations  and the use of homing peptides that were discovered in human cancer patients as the targeting moieties for pdcs potentially increases clinical probability of success 
we believe this unique mix of benefits will be attractive to potential partners in the biopharmaceutical industry 
this technology has the potential to facilitate the rapid development of multiple new product candidates  each of which could meet a critical unmet medical need 
in addition  screening in man has broad applicability in other therapeutic areas of interest to the biopharmaceutical industry

license agreements cerulean license the linear cyclodextrin based drug delivery platform  cyclosert  was designed for the delivery of small molecule drugs 
in december  we completed a phase trial with it  a conjugate of calando s linear cyclodextrin polymer and camptothecin  a potent anti cancer drug  with a positive safety profile and indications of efficacy 
on june   we entered into a transaction with cerulean related to cyclosert and it the cerulean transaction 
in the cerulean transaction  we granted cerulean an irrevocable  perpetual  royalty bearing worldwide license with the right to sublicense  under certain patent rights and know how in the field of human diseases solely in order to a conduct research and development on the linear cyclodextrin system  including making improvements thereto  in order to research and commercialize our clinical asset it now known as crlx  as well as certain other products in which no therapeutic agent is specifically defined the cerulean products  b research  develop  make  have made  use  market  offer to sell  distribute  sell and import crlx and cerulean products  and c use  copy  modify and distribute certain know how for those purposes 
in the cerulean transaction  we retained all rights with respect to products in which a therapeutic agent is a i tubulysin  ii cytolysin  iii second generation epothilone or iv nucleic acid hereinafter calando products 
the cerulean transaction also involved the sale and assignment by us of certain patents directed to cyclosert and crlx the cerulean assigned patents to cerulean 
cerulean then granted back to us an exclusive  irrevocable  perpetual  royalty free  worldwide license  with the right to grant sublicenses  under the cerulean assigned patents solely to the extent necessary to research and commercialize products in which each therapeutic agent is a cytolysin  tubulysin  second generation epothilone or any nucleic acid 
the cerulean transaction resulted in an initial payment to calando of million 
cerulean is obligated to pay development milestone payments of up to million if crlx progresses through clinical trials and receives marketing approval 
if approved  we are also entitled to receive up to an additional million in sales milestone payments  plus single digit royalties on net sales 
should cerulean sublicense crlx to a third party  we are entitled to receive a percentage of any sublicensing income at rates between and  depending on the stage of the drug s development at the time of sublicensing 
cerulean is obligated to further pay development milestone payments of up to million for each cerulean product that progresses through clinical trials and receives marketing approval 
if cerulean products are approved  we are entitled to receive up to an additional million in sales milestone payments  plus single digit royalties on net sales 
should cerulean sublicense a cerulean product to a third party  we are entitled to receive a percentage of any sublicensing income at a rate in the tens 
the terms of the agreements of the cerulean transactions are tied to the expiration of certain controlled patent rights and cerulean assigned patents 
cerulean may terminate the agreements on thirty days notice and unless there is a drug safety concern  would be obligated to re assign the crlx ind back to us and provide us with an exclusive license thereto under the cerulean assigned patents 
on august   calando terminated and cerulean assumed all of calando s rights in a license from the california institute of technology caltech under intellectual property related to linear cyclodextrin based drug delivery technology the caltech license 
notwithstanding the termination of calando s rights under the caltech license including those to the retained calando products  cerulean remains contractually obligated to make all of the aforementioned milestone  sublicensing and royalty payments to calando 
calando is no longer responsible for the costs associated with prosecution of the patents of the caltech license 
however  cerulean may offset any costs it incurs prosecuting the caltech license associated patents from payments that are due to calando 
university of texas md anderson cancer center license in december  we obtained an exclusive worldwide license from at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in houston  texas utmdacc related to adipotide technology the utmdacc license 
the utmdacc license granted us a royalty bearing  exclusive right with the right to sublicense under certain utmdacc patents to develop and commercialize certain products in the fields of therapeutics  diagnostics and research services that both i incorporate peptides that specifically target adipose tissue  and ii are used to treat  diagnose or research solely either a obesity  overweight and or b metabolic conditions related to  caused by and or associated with obesity and overweight  eg  diabetes  and cancer therapies  diagnostics and research products associated with a specific targeting moiety 
we also have rights to certain improvements to the technology 
in consideration for the license  we paid utmdacc an upfront fee of million and are obligated to pay annual fees initially equal to  increasing up to a maximum of  with such annual fees creditable against milestone payments 
we may be obligated to pay development milestone payments of up to million for each utmdcc licensed product that progresses through clinical trials and receives us marketing approval 
additional eu and japanese approval milestone payments are in the low single digit million dollar range 
if a commercial drug is developed and approved  royalty payments on net sales of utmdacc licensed products are in the low single digit range 
should we sublicense or partner a utmdacc licensed product  utmdacc would receive partnering fee percentages in the range of single digits to the twenties  depending on the stage of development of the partnered utmdacc licensed product 
the term of the utmdacc license is linked to the last to expire patents licensed therein or years if a licensed product contains only licensed know how 
we are obligated to actively and effectively attempt to commercialize the utmdacc technology and submit to utmdacc a phase clinical trial protocol within two years of obtaining an approved ind 
we are also obligated to commence a phase clinical trial within four years and a phase clinical trial within seven years of approval of an ind 
however  we may obtain yearly extensions of time upon the payment of an increasing fee in the range of tens of thousands of dollars up to several hundred thousand dollars 
we also have diligence obligations with respect to any utmdacc improvements later added to the license 
research and development facility arrowhead operates a research and development facility in madison  wisconsin 
this facility was built and equipped by roche and was part of our acquisition of their rna therapeutics business 
since the acquisition in  we have integrated all research and development operations into that facility 
a summary of the facility is provided below approximately scientists  state of the art laboratories  total sq

research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in discovering  developing and testing our clinical candidates and platform technologies 
r d expenses also include costs related to clinical trials  including costs of contract research organizations to recruit patients and manage clinical trials 
other costs associated with clinical trials include manufacturing of clinical supplies  as well as glp toxicology studies necessary to support clinical trials  both of which are outsourced to cgmp compliant manufactures and glp compliant laboratories 
total research and development expense for fiscal was million  an increase from million in we employ approximately employees in an r d function  primarily working from our facility in madison  wisconsin 
these employees are engaged in various areas of research on arrowhead candidate and platform development including synthesis and analytics  pk biodistribution  formulation  cmc and analytics  tumor and extra hepatic targeting  bioassays  live animal research  toxicology histopathology  clinical and regulatory operations  and other areas

other research and development expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these expenses are primarily related to consulting fees  technology license fees and sponsored research 
government regulation governmental authorities in the us and other countries extensively regulate the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution and marketing  among other things  of drugs and biologic products 
all of our foreseeable product candidates are expected to be regulated as drug products 
in the us  the fda regulates drug products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdca  and other laws within the public health service act 
failure to comply with applicable us requirements  both before and after approval  may lead to administrative and judicial sanctions  such as a delay in approving or refusal by the fda to approve pending applications  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  injunctions  and or criminal prosecutions 
before drug products are marketed they must be approved by the fda 
the steps required before a novel drug product is approved by the fda include pre clinical laboratory  animal  and formulation tests  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application ind for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product for each indication for which approval is sought  submission to the fda of a new drug application nda  satisfactory completion of a fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with cgmp  and fda review and finally approval of an nda 
pre clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
the results of the pre clinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
an ind will automatically become effective days after receipt by the fda  unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions  such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the ind 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding fda concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed 
there can be no assurance that submission of an ind will result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials 
once an ind is in effect  each clinical trial to be conducted under the ind must be submitted to the fda  which may or may not allow the trial to proceed 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified physician investigators and healthcare personnel 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases  but the phases may overlap or be combined 
phase usually involves the initial administration of the investigational drug or biologic product to healthy individuals to evaluate its safety  dosage tolerance and pharmacodynamics 
phase usually involves trials in a limited patient population  with the disease or condition for which the test material is being developed  to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage  identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks  and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for specific indications 
phase trials usually further evaluate effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the drug or biologic candidate in its final form in an expanded patient population 
our product development partners  the fda  or we may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including any situation where we believe that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or are obtaining no medical benefit from the test material 
assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing  the results of the pre clinical trials and the clinical trials  together with other detailed information  including information on the manufacture and composition of the product  are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications 
before approving an application  the fda will usually inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured  and will not approve the product unless cgmp compliance is satisfactory 
if the fda determines the nda is not acceptable  the fda may outline the deficiencies in the nda and often will request additional information 
if the fda approves the nda  certain changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims are subject to further fda review and approval 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and approval on a timely basis  if at all  cannot be guaranteed 
under the orphan drug act  the fda may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition  which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states  or more than  individuals in the us and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the us a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the us for that drug 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an nda 
after the fda grants orphan drug designation  the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda 
if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity  which means that the fda may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication  except in very limited circumstances  for seven years 
in addition  regardless of the type of approval  we and our partners are required to comply with a number of fda requirements both before and after approval 
for example  drug makers are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems  if any  to the fda  and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products 
in addition  quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval  and the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance  including production and quality control to comply with cgmp 
in addition  discovery of problems  such as safety problems  may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or nda holder  including removal of the product from the market

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks discussed below and all of the other information contained in this report in evaluating us and an investment in our securities 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties should occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
additionally  we note that we are a development stage company and we have accrued net losses annually since inception 
we urge you to consider our likelihood of success and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by entities at similar stages of development 
risks related to our company drug development is time consuming  expensive and risky 
we are focused on technology related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates 
product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in animal and early human clinical trials  often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as clinical trial results may be unacceptable  even though preclinical trial results were promising  inefficacy and or harmful side effects in humans or animals  the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the us food and drug administration  may not approve our potential product for the intended use  and manufacturing and distribution may be uneconomical 
for example  the positive pre clinical results for arc in animals may not be replicated in human clinical studies or it may be found to be unsafe in humans 
additionally  clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians and others  which often delays  limits  or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products 
clinical trials can take many years to complete  including the process of study design  clinical site selection and the enrollment of patients 
as a result  we can experience significant delays in completing clinical studies  which can increase the cost of developing a drug candidate 
if our drug candidates are not successful in human clinical trials  we may be forced to curtail or abandon certain development programs 
if we experience significant delays in commencing or completing our clinical studies  we could suffer from significant cost overruns  which could negatively affect our capital resources and our ability to complete these studies 
there are substantial risks inherent in attempting to commercialize new drugs  and  as a result  we may not be able to successfully develop products for commercial use 
our research and development efforts involve therapeutics based on rna interference and peptide targeting  which are largely unproven technologies 
our scientists and engineers are working on developing technology in various stages 
however  such technology s commercial feasibility and acceptance are unknown 
scientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes a long time to reach commercial viability  if it can be achieved at all 
to date  our research and development projects have not produced commercially viable drugs  and may never do so 
during the research and development process  we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome 
because of these uncertainties  it is possible that no commercial products will be successfully developed 
if we are unable to successfully develop commercial products  we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business 
our drug candidates are in the early stages of our development and because we have a short development history with both dpcs and homing peptides  there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects 
we have not begun to market or generate revenues from the commercialization of any products 
we have only a limited history upon which one can evaluate our targeted therapeutic business and prospects as our drug candidates are still at an early stage of development 
thus  we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields  particularly in the biopharmaceutical area 
for example  to execute our business plan  we will need to successfully execute product development activities using unproven technologies  build  maintain and protect a strong intellectual property portfolio  receive fda approval and gain market acceptance for the development and commercialization of any drugs we develop  develop and maintain successful strategic relationships  and manage our spending and cash requirements as our expenses are expected to increase in the near term due to preclinical and clinical trials 
if we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives  we may not be able to develop products  raise capital  expand our business or continue our operations 
we may be unable to attract revenue generating collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to advance our drug candidates 
our business strategy includes obtaining collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to support the development of our therapeutic sirna and other drug candidates 
we may not be able to attract such partners  and even if we are able to enter into such partnerships  the terms may be less favorable than anticipated 
further  entering into partnership agreements may limit our commercialization options and or require us to share revenues and profits with our partners 
we will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our drug candidates to generate revenues and achieve profitability 
even if our research and development efforts yield technologically feasible applications  we may not successfully develop commercial products 
drug development takes years of study in human clinical trials prior to regulatory approval  and  even if we are successful  we may not be so on a timely basis 
during our development period  superior competitive technologies may be introduced which could diminish or extinguish the potential commercial uses for our drug candidates 
additionally  the degree to which the medical community and consumers will adopt any product we develop is uncertain 
the rate and degree of market acceptance of our products will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our products and their potential advantage over alternative treatments 
we cannot predict whether significant commercial market acceptance for our products  if approved  will ever develop  and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market 
our revenue growth and achievement of profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce products that will be accepted by the medical community 
if we are unable to cost effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among the medical establishment and patients  or if the associated products do not achieve wide market acceptance  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our financial condition we have a history of net losses  and we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  including net losses of million for the year ended september  and a cumulative net loss since inception of approximately million 
we expect that our operating losses will continue as we continue our drug development and discovery efforts 
to achieve profitability  we must  either directly or through licensing and or partnering relationships  successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for one or more drug candidates and effectively manufacture  market and sell any drugs we successfully develop 
even if we successfully commercialize drug candidates that receive regulatory approval  we may not be able to realize revenues at a level that would allow us to achieve or sustain profitability 
accordingly  we may never generate significant revenue and  even if we do generate significant revenue  we may never achieve profitability 
we will require substantial additional funds to complete our research and development activities 
our business currently does not generate the cash that is necessary to finance our operations 
subject to the success of the research and development programs of our company and our partners  and potential licensing or partnering transactions  we will likely need to raise additional capital to fund research and development activities relating to our development of our drug candidates  including pre clinical and preclinical trials and manufacturing to support these efforts  fund our general and administrative activities  pursue licensing opportunities for our technologies  protect our intellectual property  and retain our management and technical staff 
our future capital needs depend on many factors  including the scope  duration and expenditures associated with our research and development  the extent to which our r d and clinical efforts are successful  and clinical trial requirements  the outcome of potential partnering or licensing transactions  if any  competing technological developments  our proprietary patent position  if any  in our products  and the regulatory approval process for our drug candidates 
we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements in the future to continue our operations 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
general market conditions may make it very difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets  and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our stockholders will result  which may substantially dilute the value of your investment 
in addition  as a condition to providing additional funds to us  future investors may demand  and may be granted  rights superior to those of existing stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities and  in the event of insolvency  would be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of corporate assets 
we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us  in order to raise additional funds through alliance  joint venture or licensing arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may have to further delay  reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities 
these actions would likely reduce the market price of our common stock 
the investment of our cash  cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 
at september   we had million in fixed income marketable securities 
these investments are in corporate bonds nearing maturity  but our investments may also include commercial paper  securities issued by the us government obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds meeting the criteria of our investment policy  which is focused on the preservation of our capital 
these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  and market and interest rate risks 
we may realize losses in the fair value of these investments or a complete loss of these investments  which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us  our interest income would suffer 
the market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
we may not be able to effectively secure first tier technologies when competing against other investors 
our success may require that we acquire new or complimentary technologies 
however  we compete with a substantial number of other companies that may also compete for technologies we desire 
in addition  many venture capital firms and other institutional investors  as well as other pharmaceutical and biotech companies  invest in companies seeking to commercialize various types of emerging technologies 
many of these companies have greater financial  scientific and commercial resources than us 
therefore  we may not be able to secure the technologies we desire 
furthermore  should any commercial undertaking by us prove to be successful  there can be no assurance competitors with greater financial resources will not offer competitive products and or technologies 
risks associated with reliance on third parties we will need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop and market our products 
we do not possess all of the financial and development resources necessary to develop and commercialize products that may result from our technologies on a mass scale 
unless we expand our product development capacity and enhance our internal marketing capability  we will need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize current and future products 
if we do not find appropriate partners  or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful  our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected 
even if we are able to find collaborative partners  the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates in those programs will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and is beyond our control 
in addition  in the event we pursue our commercialization strategy through collaboration  there are a variety of technical  business and legal risks  including a development partner would likely gain access to our proprietary information  potentially enabling the partner to develop products without us or design around our intellectual property  we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development or commercialization of our drug candidates or to their marketing and distribution  and disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research  development or commercialization of our drug candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management s resources 
the occurrence of any of the above events or other related events not foreseen by us could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition 
we may lose a considerable amount of control over our intellectual property and may not receive anticipated revenues in strategic transactions  particularly where the consideration is contingent on the achievement of development or sales milestones 
our business model has been to develop new technologies and to exploit the intellectual property created through the research and development process to develop commercially successful products 
for example  calando has licensed a portion of its technology to cerulean pharma  inc and has ceased internal technical and business development activities 
a significant portion of the potential value from these licenses is tied to the achievement of the development and sales milestones  which we cannot control 
similarly  the majority of the consideration  up to million  potentially payable by wisepower in connection with our sale of unidym is tied to the achievement of commercialization milestones  which we cannot control 
although wisepower and cerulean are required to use certain minimum efforts to achieve the post closing milestones  we cannot control whether they actually achieve these milestones 
if the acquirers fail to achieve performance milestones  we may not receive a significant portion of the total value of any sale  license or other strategic transaction 
we rely on outside sources for various components and processes for our products 
we rely on third parties for various components and processes for our product candidates 
we may not be able to achieve multiple sourcing because there may be no acceptable second source  other companies may choose not to work with us  or the component or process sought may be so new that a second source does not exist  or does not exist on acceptable terms 
there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators which is beyond our control 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
therefore  it is possible that our business plans will have to be slowed down or stopped completely at times due to our inability to obtain required raw materials  components and outsourced processes at an acceptable cost  if at all  or to get a timely response from vendors 
we have limited manufacturing capability and must rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture our clinical supplies and commercial products  if and when approved  and if they fail to meet their obligations  the development and commercialization of our products could be adversely affected 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities and experience 
arc and our other drug candidates are composed of multiple components and require specialized formulations for which scale up and manufacturing could be difficult 
we also have limited experience in such scale up and manufacturing requiring us to depend on a limited number of third parties  who may not be able to deliver in a timely manner  or at all 
in order to develop products  apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize our products  we will need to develop  contract for  or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities 
our internal manufacturing capabilities are limited to small scale production of material for use in in vitro and in vivo experiments that is not required to be produced under current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  standards 
there are a limited number of manufacturers that supply synthetic sirnas 
there are risks inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing that could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers to meet our delivery time requirements or provide adequate amounts of material to meet our needs 
included in these risks are synthesis and purification failures and contamination during the manufacturing process  which could result in unusable product and cause delays in our development process  as well as additional expense to us 
additionally  our product candidates have not yet been manufactured for commercial use 
if any of our product candidates become approved for commercial sale  we will need to establish third party manufacturing capacity 
a third party manufacturing partner may require us to fund capital improvements to support the scale up of manufacturing and related activities 
the third party manufacturer may not be able to establish scaled manufacturing capacity for an approved product in a timely or economic manner  if at all 
if a manufacturer is unable to provide commercial quantities of such an approved product  we will have to successfully transfer manufacturing technology to a different manufacturer 
engaging a new manufacturer for such an approved product could require us to conduct comparative studies or utilize other means to determine bioequivalence of the new and prior manufacturers products  which could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize such an approved product 
if any of these manufacturers is unable or unwilling to increase its manufacturing capacity or if we are unable to establish alternative arrangements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  the development and commercialization of such an approved product may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply 
any inability to manufacture our product candidates or future approved drugs in sufficient quantities when needed would seriously harm our business 
manufacturers of our approved products  if any  must comply with current good manufacturing practices cgmp requirements enforced by the us food and drug administration and other foreign health authorities through facilities inspection programs 
these requirements include quality control  quality assurance  and the maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturers of our approved products  if any  may be unable to comply with these cgmp requirements and with other fda  state  and foreign regulatory requirements 
we have little control over our manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
a failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties  suspension of production  suspension or delay in product approval  product seizure or recall  or withdrawal of product approval 
if the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturer s failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products  which would seriously harm our business 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials  and if they fail to fulfill their obligations  our development plans may be adversely affected 
we rely on independent clinical investigators  contract research organizations and other third party service providers to assist us in managing  monitoring and otherwise carrying out our clinical trials 
we have contracted  and we plan to continue to contract with certain third parties to provide certain services  including site selection  enrollment  monitoring and data management services 
although we depend heavily on these parties  we do not control them and therefore  we cannot be assured that these third parties will adequately perform all of their contractual obligations to us 
if our third party service providers cannot adequately and timely fulfill their obligations to us  or if the quality and accuracy of our clinical trial data is compromised due to failure by such third party to adhere to our protocols or regulatory requirements or if such third parties otherwise fail to meet deadlines  our development plans may be delayed or terminated 
risks related to managing our operations our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and scientists with relevant expertise 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees  including dr 
anzalone  our president and chief executive officer  dr 
bruce given  our chief operating officer  dr 
david lewis  our chief scientific officer  and kenneth myszkowski  our chief financial officer 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our executives 
our ability to execute our strategy also will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientists and management 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we could have difficulty implementing our business plan in a timely manner  or at all 
members of our senior management team and board may have a conflict of interest in also serving as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries 
while we expect that our officers and directors who also serve as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries will comply with their fiduciary duties owed to our stockholders  they may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and the minority stockholders of our subsidiaries 
specifically  dr 
anzalone  our president and ceo as well as dr 
mauro ferrari  an arrowhead board member  are board members of leonardo  a drug delivery company in which arrowhead owns a interest 
drs 
anzalone and ferrari own a noncontrolling interest in leonardo 
douglass given  a member of our board of directors  is the brother of bruce given  our chief operating officer 
to the extent that any of our directors choose to recuse themselves from particular board actions to avoid a conflict of interest  the other members of our board of directors will have a greater influence on such decisions 
our business and operations could suffer in the event of information technology system failures 
despite the implementation of security measures  our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses  unauthorized access  natural disasters  terrorism  war  and telecommunication and electrical failures 
such events could cause interruption of our operations 
for example  the loss of pre clinical trial data or data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information  we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed 
risks related to our development  regulatory approval  and marketing of our product candidates the manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products are governed by a variety of statutes and regulations 
there can be no assurance that our product candidates will obtain regulatory approval 
the sale of human therapeutic products in the us and foreign jurisdictions is subject to extensive and time consuming regulatory approval which requires controlled research and human clinical testing  establishment of the safety and efficacy of the product for each use sought  government review and approval of a submission containing manufacturing  pre clinical and clinical data  adherence to good manufacturing practice regulations during production and storage  and control of marketing activities  including advertising and labeling 
the product candidates we currently have under development will require significant development  pre clinical and clinical testing and investment of significant funds before their commercialization 
some of our product candidates  if approved  will require the completion of post market studies 
there can be no assurance that such products will be developed and approved 
the process of completing clinical testing and obtaining required approvals is likely to take a number of years and require the use of substantial resources 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approvals  our operations will be adversely affected 
further  there can be no assurance that product candidates employing a new technology will be shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials or receive applicable regulatory approvals 
investors should be aware of the risks  problems  delays  expenses and difficulties which we may encounter in view of the extensive regulatory environment which affects our business in any jurisdiction where we develop product candidates 
if testing of a particular product candidate does not yield successful results  then we will be unable to commercialize that product candidate 
we must demonstrate our product candidates safety and efficacy in humans through extensive clinical testing 
our research and development programs are at an early stage of development 
we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of any products  including the following the results of pre clinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  safety and efficacy results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials  after reviewing test results  we may abandon projects that we might previously have believed to be promising  we or our regulators  may suspend or terminate clinical trials because the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  and our product candidates may not have the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved 
clinical testing is very expensive  can take many years  and the outcome is uncertain 
the data collected from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to support approval of our product candidates by the regulatory authorities 
the clinical trials of our product candidates may not be completed on schedule  and the regulatory authorities may not ultimately approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale 
if we fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate  this would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
it may take us longer than we are currently projecting to complete our clinical trials  and we may not be able to complete them at all 
although for planning purposes  we project the commencement  continuation and completion of our clinical trials  a number of factors  including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  and difficulties in identifying or enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria  may cause significant delays 
we may not commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our product candidates as projected or may not conduct them successfully 
even if we achieve regulatory approval  future regulatory reviews or inspections may result in the suspension or withdrawal of one or more of our products  closure of a facility or enforcement of substantial fines 
if regulatory approval to sell any of our product candidates is received  regulatory agencies may  nevertheless  limit the categories of patients who can use them 
in addition  regulatory agencies subject a marketed product  its manufacture and the manufacturers facilities to continual review and periodic inspection 
if previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturing and laboratory facility are discovered or we fail to comply with applicable regulatory approval requirements  a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or on us 
the agency may require the withdrawal of the product from the market  closure of the facility or enforcement of substantial fines 
our ability to successfully commercialize human therapeutic products may depend in part on reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  and adequate third party coverage may not be available to establish price levels sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
when we partner our product candidates we will typically be relying on that partner to obtain cost reimbursement from third parties for the product candidate 
we face potential product liability exposure  and if successful claims are brought against us  we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization 
the use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims might be brought against us by clinical trial participants  consumers  health care providers  pharmaceutical companies  or others selling our products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims  we may incur substantial liabilities 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  impairment of our business reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants  loss of revenues  and the inability to commercialize our product candidates 
although we currently have liability insurance for our clinical trials our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer 
moreover  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and  in the future  we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses 
the successful commercialization of our product candidates  if approved will depend in part on the extent to which government authorities and health insurers establish adequate reimbursement levels and pricing policies 
sales of any approved drug candidate will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers such as government insurance programs  including medicare and medicaid  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations and other health care related organizations 
accordingly  coverage and reimbursement may be uncertain 
adoption of any drug candidate by the medical community may be limited if third party payers will not offer coverage 
additionally  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved drugs 
cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for any new drug and  in turn  the price that we will be able to charge 
we are unable to predict all changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or government payers 
any denial of private or government payer coverage or inadequate reimbursement could harm our business and reduce our revenue 
in addition  both the federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation affecting coverage and reimbursement policies  which are designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care  as well as hold public hearings on these matters  which has resulted in certain private companies dropping the prices of their drugs 
further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely  which could limit the prices that can be charged for the product candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity 
there may be future changes that result in reductions in potential coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates  if approved and commercialized  and we cannot predict the scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have on our operations 
if future reimbursement for approved product candidates  if any  is substantially less than we project  or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased  our business and commercial opportunities could be materially and adversely impacted 
risks related to our patents  licenses and trade secrets our ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain  exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage 
we have licensed rights to pending patents and have filed and expect to continue to file patent applications 
researchers sponsored by us may also file patent applications that we choose to license 
if a particular patent is not granted  the value of the invention described in the patent would be diminished 
further  even if these patents are granted  they may be difficult to enforce 
even if successful  efforts to enforce our patent rights could be expensive  distracting for management  cause our patents to be invalidated  and frustrate commercialization of products 
additionally  even if patents are issued and are enforceable  others may independently develop similar  superior or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us  or our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others 
finally  patent prosecution is expensive  and we may be forced to curtail prosecution if our cash resources are limited 
thus  the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage 
if we are unable to derive value from our licensed or owned intellectual property  the value of your investment may decline 
our subsidiaries are party to technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective and  if these agreements are terminated  our technology and our business would be seriously and adversely affected 
through our subsidiaries  we are party to license agreements with university of texas md anderson cancer center  alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc and other entities to incorporate their proprietary technologies into our drug products under development 
these license agreements require us to pay royalties and satisfy other conditions  including conditions in some cases related to the commercialization of the licensed technology 
we may not be able to successfully incorporate these technologies into marketable products or  if we do  sales may not be sufficient to recover the amounts that we are obligated to pay to the licensors 
if we fail to satisfy our obligations under these agreements  the terms of the licenses may be materially modified  such as by rendering currently exclusive licenses non exclusive  or may give our licensors the right to terminate their respective agreement with us  which would limit our ability to implement our current business plan and harm our business and financial condition 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products 
because the intellectual property landscape in the fields in which we participate is rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary  it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third party rights 
however  we are currently aware of certain patent rights held by third parties that  if found to be valid and enforceable  could be alleged to render one or more of our business lines infringing 
if a claim should be brought and is successful  we may be required to pay substantial damages  be forced to abandon any affected business lines and or seek a license from the patent holder 
in addition  any patent infringement claims brought against us  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns 
these could negatively affect our results of operations and prospects 
we cannot be certain that patents owned or licensed by us or our subsidiaries will not be challenged by others 
in addition  if our potential products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  these third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers  and we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages they suffer as a result of these claims 
the claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use 
if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to continue selling such products 
we license patent rights from third party owner and we rely on such owners to obtain  maintain and enforce the patents underlying such licenses 
we are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to third party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business 
in particular  we have obtained licenses from  among others  alnylam and the university of texas md anderson cancer center 
we also expect to enter into additional licenses to third party intellectual property in the future 
our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain  maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property  in particular  those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights 
our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications to which we are licensed 
even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications  our licensors may fail to maintain these patents  may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents  or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would 
without protection for the intellectual property we license  other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale  which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects 
our technology licensed from various third parties may be subject to government rights and retained rights of the originating research institutions 
we license a portion of our technology from government funded sources such as the university of texas md anderson cancer center 
our other licensors may have obligations to government agencies or universities 
under their agreements  a government agency or university may obtain certain rights over the technology that we have developed and licensed  including the right to require that a compulsory license be granted to one or more third parties selected by the government agency 
in addition  our licensors often retain certain rights under their agreements with us  including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use  to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology  and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology 
it is difficult to monitor whether our licensors limit their use of the technology to these uses  and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse 
risks related to our stock stockholder equity interest may be substantially diluted in any additional financing 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  on such terms and at such prices as our board of directors may determine 
as of september   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
the issuance of additional securities in financing transactions by us or through the exercise of options or warrants will dilute the equity interests of our existing stockholders  perhaps substantially  and might result in dilution in the tangible net book value of a share of our common stock  depending upon the price and other terms on which the additional shares are issued 
our common stock price has fluctuated significantly over the last several years and may continue to do so in the future  without regard to our results of operations and prospects 
because we are a development stage company  there are few objective metrics by which our progress may be measured 
consequently  we expect that the market price of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate significantly 
we may not generate substantial revenue from the license or sale of our technology for several years  if at all 
in the absence of product revenue as a measure of our operating performance  we anticipate that investors and market analysts will assess our performance by considering factors such as announcements of developments related to our business  our ability to enter into or extend investigation phase  development phase  commercialization phase and other agreements with new and or existing partners  announcements regarding the status of any or all of our collaborations or products  market perception and or investor sentiment regarding our technology  announcements regarding developments in the rna interference or biotechnology fields in general  market perception and or announcements regarding other companies developing products in the field of rna interference  the issuance of competitive patents or disallowance or loss of our patent rights  and variations in our operating results 
we will not have control over many of these factors but expect that they may influence our stock price 
as a result  our stock price may be volatile and such volatility could result in the loss of all or part of your investment 
additionally  in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
the market for purchases and sales of our common stock may be limited  and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market  at various times our securities have been relatively thinly traded 
investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of our stock 
for example  mandatory sales of our common stock by institutional holders could be triggered if an investment in our common stock no longer satisfies their investment standards and guidelines 
it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock 
unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock  sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock  our stock price and trading volume may decline 
the trading market for our common stock can be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business 
currently  coverage of our company by industry and securities analysts is limited 
investors have many investment opportunities and may limit their investments to companies that receive greater coverage from analysts 
if additional industry or securities analysts do not commence coverage of the company  the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
if one or more of the analysts downgrade our stock or comment negatively on our prospects  our stock price may decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease to cover our industry or us or fails to publish reports about the company regularly  our common stock could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could also cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common stock 
we will not distribute cash to our stockholders unless and until we can develop sufficient funds from operations to meet our ongoing needs and implement our business plan 
the time frame for that is unpredictable and investors should not expect dividends in the near future  if at all 
our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  which may make an acquisition of the company by another company more difficult 
we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the company that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
specifically  our board of directors  without further action by our stockholders  currently has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights including voting rights  preferences and privileges of these shares blank check preferred 
such preferred stock may have rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial statements and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further information  see note  organization and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements which outlines our application of significant accounting policies and new accounting standards 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed and delivery has occurred  a price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we may generate revenue from technology licenses  collaborative research and development arrangements  research grants and product sales 
revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and or guaranteed technology license fees  collaborative research funding  and various milestone and future product royalty or profit sharing payments 
revenue associated with research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements is recognized ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research and development period 
revenue from up front license fees  milestones and product royalties are recognized as earned based on the completion of the milestones and product sales  as defined in the respective agreements 
payments received in advance of recognition as revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
business combinations in october  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of roche madison  inc and certain related intellectual property assets for a  promissory note and  shares of arrowhead common stock  an estimated consideration value of million on the date of the acquisition 
we assigned the value of the consideration to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values on the date of acquisition 
the excess of net assets over the consideration was recorded as a nonoperating gain 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of alvos therapeutics  inc in exchange for the issuance of  shares of arrowhead common stock  valued at million at the time of acquisition 
the consideration was assigned to its tangible and intangible assets  and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the time of acquisition 
the allocation of value to certain items  including property and equipment  intangible assets and certain liabilities require management judgment  and is based upon the information available at the time of acquisition 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that our assumptions about the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
if impairment is indicated  recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
impairment of intangible assets intangible assets consist of in process research and development  patents and license agreements acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition 
intangible assets are monitored for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  and are also reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment is necessary 
based on asu  the annual review of intangible assets is performed via a two step process 
first  a qualitative assessment is performed to determine if it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired 
if required  a quantitative assessment is performed and  if necessary  impairment is recorded 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value using the black scholes options pricing model  which requires us to make assumptions regarding certain variables including the risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating stock based compensation expense represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties  and if factors change or the company used different assumptions  its stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
derivative assets and liabilities we account for warrants and other derivative financial instruments as either equity or assets liabilities based upon the characteristics and provisions of each instrument 
warrants classified as equity are recorded as additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet and no further adjustments to their valuation are made 
some of our warrants were determined to be ineligible for equity classification because of provisions that may result in an adjustment to their exercise price 
warrants classified as derivative liabilities and other derivative financial instruments that require separate accounting as assets or liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value on the date of issuance and are revalued on each subsequent balance sheet date until such instruments are exercised or expire  with any changes in the fair value between reporting periods recorded as other income or expense 
we estimate the fair value of these assets liabilities using option pricing models that are based on the individual characteristics of the warrants or instruments on the valuation date  as well as assumptions for expected volatility  expected life and risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions used could have a material impact on the resulting fair value 
the primary input affecting the value of our derivatives liabilities is the company s stock price 
for example  at september   a change in the value of the company s stock price would affect the value of the derivative liability by approximately million to million  depending on other inputs 
reverse stock split as of november   the company effected a for reverse stock split the reverse stock split 
as a result of the reverse stock split  each ten shares of the company s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the reverse split were combined into one share of common stock 
also  as a result of the reverse stock split  the per share exercise price of  and the number of shares of common stock underlying outstanding company stock options  warrants  preferred stock and any common stock based equity grants outstanding immediately prior to the reverse stock split was proportionally adjusted  based on the one for ten split ratio  in accordance with the terms of such options  warrants or other common stock based equity grants as the case may be 
no fractional shares of common stock were issued in connection with the reverse stock split 
stockholders instead received cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares 
unless otherwise noted  all share and per share amounts in these have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split 
full year review during  the company made substantial progress with its lead clinical candidate  arc  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b infection 
in july  the company began a phase clinical trial in australia in healthy volunteers to characterize the safety profile of arc this trial completed enrollment in october  and the company is preparing for a phase a pilot efficacy study for chronically infected hbv patients 
the company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials  focusing on intravenous administered liver targets  as well as subcutaneous liver targets 
the company has partnered programs in oncology and obesity 
the company s research and development efforts are concentrated at our research facility in madison  wisconsin 
clinical candidates are tested through glp toxicology studies at outside laboratories  and drug materials for such studies  and for clinical trials  are contracted to third party manufactures when cgmp production is required 
the company engages third party contract research organizations cros to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trials  including plan design  patient recruiting  and follow up 
these outside costs  relating to the preparation and administration of clinical trials  are referred to as program costs  and as the company is successful in the progression of its clinical candidates  program costs will increase 
results of operations the company had a net loss of million for the year ended september   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended september   an increase of million 
the increase in the net loss was the result of a number of factors 
from an operating standpoint  the main factor was higher r d expenses of million for preclinical glp toxicology studies and cgmp drug manufacturing in preparation of the clinical trial for arc  as well as costs for the phase clinical trial of arc general and administrative expenses were lower in by million  but this change was primarily due to the prior year write down of certain receivables from minority interest companies 
salaries and payroll related expenses increased nominally in  primarily due to headcount increases and general salary adjustments 
in  the company recorded a noncash impairment expense of million to write off certain patents as a result of a termination of a license agreement 
other expense was higher in by million primarily due to noncash losses from the change in value of derivatives  as well as the write down of a note receivable obtained as part of our disposition of unidym in details of the results of operations are presented below 
revenues total revenue was  for the year ended september  and  for the year ended september  revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front patent license fee payments 
in addition  the company had collaboration revenue of  during the year ended september  operating expenses the analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the company within the major expense categories 
for purposes of comparison  the amounts for the years ended september  and are shown in the table below 
salary and payroll related expenses fiscal compared to fiscal the company employs scientific  technical and administrative staff at its corporate offices and its research facility 
salaries and payroll related expense consists of salary and related benefits 
salary and benefits include two major categories general and administrative g a compensation expense  and research and development r d compensation expense  based on the primary activities of each employee 
the following table provides detail of salary and related benefits expenses for the years ended september  and in thousands twelve months ended september  of expense category twelve months ended september  of expense category increase decrease g a compensation related r d compensation related total during the year ended september   g a compensation expense decreased  a decline of 
during the year ended september   r d compensation expense increased  compensation expense for r d employees is primarily composed of the personnel costs at our r d facility in madison  wisconsin 
during  the company hired two additional employees 
the company plans to further increase its workforce to accelerate research and development efforts to add additional clinical candidates to its pipeline 
general administrative expenses fiscal compared to fiscal the following table provides details of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended september  and in thousands twelve months ended september  of expense category twelve months ended september  of expense category increase decrease professional outside services patent expense facilities and related travel business insurance communication and technology office expenses other total professional outside services include legal  accounting and other outside services retained by the company 
all periods include normally occurring legal and accounting expenses related to sec compliance and other corporate matters
