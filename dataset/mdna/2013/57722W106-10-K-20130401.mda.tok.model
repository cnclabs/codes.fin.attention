executive summary we operate in the us mattress retail market  in which net sales amounted to billion in calendar year the market is highly fragmented  with no single retailer holding more than an market share and the top ten participants accounting for less than of the total market 
according to the most recent information published by furniture today  in  mattress specialty retailers had a market share in excess of  which represents the largest share of the market  having more than doubled their share over the past years 
on november   we completed the initial public offering of shares of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on form s  as amended file no 
 which was declared effective on november  under the registration statement  we registered the offering and sale of up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock including shares issued pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares at a public offering price of per share 
on october   we completed the secondary offering of  shares of our common stock by certain of our selling shareholders 
we did not sell any shares of common stock in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the sale 
net sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal improved million  million and million  respectively  from the comparable prior year levels as a result of comparable store sales growth and the addition of new and acquired store units 
we believe that our net sales growth is outpacing our competitors in most of the markets in which we operate and is resulting in increased market share 
net income and other profitability measures improved during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  which resulted from the net sales growth and our ability to gain leverage on certain costs thereby increasing profitability per store 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in spending in certain expense categories during the period primarily in support of increasing net sales  including general and administrative expenses  and temporary deleverage in store occupancy and other operating expenses related to acquisitions of stores with sales productivity levels that  while improving  remain below the levels of our existing store base 
key results for fiscal include net income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal income from operations increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal excluding million of acquisition related  secondary offering and impairment costs  adjusted income from operations was million for fiscal and adjusted operating margin improved basis points to from in fiscal this operating margin growth for fiscal on an adjusted basis excluding acquisition related  secondary offering and impairment costs was driven primarily by a basis point improvement in general and administrative expense offset by basis points of leverage reduction in selling and marketing expense and other areas

risk factors our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect the integrity and security of our customers information for additional information relating to some important risks relating to our information technology 
we believe that the us mattress retail market remains affected by the pent up demand for mattresses and related products that has developed as consumers have delayed purchases of big ticket home furnishings  including mattresses  in response to the slow recovery of the national economy  increased tax rates and overall fiscal uncertainty 
we expect that this pent up demand will result in sales growth for the company as the national economy and consumer confidence continue to improve 
we expect to continue the expansion of our company operated store base through new store openings in existing markets to increase our market share and new store openings in new markets to provide a platform for future growth 
we plan to open to new company operated stores in fiscal in addition  we intend to evaluate strategically valuable acquisition opportunities in existing and new markets that may arise from time to time 
we also strive to increase sales and profitability within our existing network of stores through a combination of i advertising and marketing initiatives that are aimed at increasing customer traffic  ii improved customer conversion through our merchandising approach that improves the customer shopping experience and the efforts of our highly trained sales associates and iii increasing the average price of a transaction through effective sales techniques and the increasing demand for specialty mattresses 
on may   we completed the acquisition of the equity interests of mghc holding corporation for approximately million 
the acquisition added former mattress giant retail stores in texas and florida  which are the two largest states in which we currently operate

the mattress x press stores have been rebranded as mattress firm stores 
on december   we acquired substantially all of the operations and assets of factory mattress water bed outlet of charlotte  inc which operated mattress source stores  including mattress specialty stores located in north carolina and south carolina for a total purchase price of approximately million 
prior to the acquisitions  we operated stores in north carolina and south carolina 
permanent rebranding  including renovations and the addition of permanent signage for the mattress source stores  is expected to be complete in fiscal the aforementioned acquisitions  and subsequent rebranding of the acquired stores as mattress firm  is advancing our market level profitability model that is centered on the benefits of increasing our level of store penetration in several of our major markets 
we believe that the incremental sales and store level contribution attributable to the acquired stores will support our ability to increase the advertising spend in each of the markets  which is expected to drive sales increases in both the acquired 
table of contents and existing stores 
this strategy is expected to provide sales increases  greater leverage over market level costs and improved market level profitability

income tax benefit expense 
we recognized million of income tax benefit during fiscal  compared to million of income tax expense during fiscal the effective tax rate was during fiscal  compared to during fiscal  and differs primarily as a result of the change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recognized during fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the effective tax rate during fiscal differs from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the change in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in an amount that coincides with a reduction in deferred tax assets associated with current year operations as well as the release of the remaining valuation allowance during the fourth quarter ended january  prior to january   we provided a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on our evaluation that realizability of such assets was not more likely than not as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
asc accounting for income taxes requires that all available evidence  both positive and negative  be identified and considered in making a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets related to tax attributes and other deductible temporary differences will be realized 
during fiscal  we continuously evaluated additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
such deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences on goodwill and noncurrent liabilities 
the company results of operations during fiscal resulted in the utilization of a portion of net operating loss carryforwards 
furthermore  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on additional evidence regarding our past earnings  scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities  including the cessation of interest deductions due to current year debt retirements resulting from the completion of the initial public offering on november   we determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets as of january  would be realized 
accordingly  the results of operations during fiscal include a deferred tax benefit in the amount of million related to the change in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that occurred through the combination of current operations and the release of the remaining valuation allowance as of january  net income loss

table of contents operating cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily due to i a million improvement in net income  which includes an million increase in cash income taxes resulting from our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset only a portion of taxable income during  and as increased by million from the exclusion of the changes in noncash items included in net income  compared to the prior year  and ii changes in operating assets and liabilities  which resulted in an incremental use of operating cash flows of million  as compared to the prior year  consisting primarily of a million in cash used in fiscal to satisfy obligations related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities assumed in acquisitions  b million in cash used for increases in floor sample inventories related to the addition of new and acquired stores in fiscal  and c million in cash used from changes in other operating assets and liabilities related to our growth and from normal fluctuations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the million increase in cash flows from operating activities was comprised of the million improvement in our net income during fiscal as compared to the prior year and an million increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities as compared to the prior year due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to increased sales levels  partially offset by a million decrease in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities primarily due to a deferred income tax benefit upon release of our valuation allowance  net of a non cash loss from debt extinguishment 
investing cash flows 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash used of million for fiscal the million increase was primarily due to the may mattress giant  september mattress x press  and december mattress source acquisitions that utilized approximately million  million and million in cash during fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures increased million primarily due to new store openings  rebranding and renovations of acquired stores and the ongoing design and implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system 
excluding stores added through acquisitions  we opened new stores during fiscal  compared to new stores in fiscal the renovations of mattress giant stores acquired in november and may resulted in approximately million in capital expenditures during fiscal the renovations of mattress x press and mattress source stores acquired in september and december  respectively  resulted in approximately million in capital expenditures during fiscal we expect to incur approximately million during fiscal to complete the rebranding and renovation of the acquired mattress giant  mattress x press and mattress source stores 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal capital expenditures increased million 
excluding stores added through acquisitions  we opened new stores during fiscal  compared to new stores in fiscal partially offsetting the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal was a decrease of million in cash used to complete our acquisition in fiscal as compared to two acquisitions that occurred in fiscal the fiscal acquisition added new stores 
financing cash flows 
our financing cash flows consist of i proceeds from the issuance of common stock  exercise of stock options  issuance of debt and borrowings under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility  and ii uses primarily from scheduled payments and  from time to time  prepayments of our outstanding amounts of debt and borrowings under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million for fiscal the million increase was primarily the result of net borrowings under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility 

table of contents during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to net cash used of million in fiscal the million increase in net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was attributable to million in proceeds from issuance of common stock  net of costs  in connection with the initial public offering partially offset by net debt repayments  utilizing proceeds from the initial public offering  and debt issuance costs in the aggregate amount of million during fiscal initial public offering on november   we completed the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at per share  before underwriting discounts and commissions 
the initial public offering generated net proceeds to us of approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering related costs 
the company used a portion of the proceeds to repay the subordinated loan facility  as amended in march the loan facility in full 
in connection with the offering  the principal and accrued interest of the payment in kind investor notes maturing at various times from october  through march  the pik notes were either repaid or converted into shares of our common stock and the convertible notes due july  the convertible notes were converted into shares of our common stock 
as a result  we reduced our outstanding debt  with a weighted average interest rate of  in the aggregate amount of million in principal and accrued interest thereon 
we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment in the amount of million during the fiscal  related to the reduction of debt in advance of and in connection with the initial public offering 
as a result of the initial public offering we are incurring significantly lower amounts of interest expense 
sources of liquidity and capital requirements our primary uses of cash are to fund growth capital and maintenance expenditures for our stores and distribution centers  purchases and replacement of floor sample inventories maintained in our stores  scheduled debt service payments and strategic acquisitions of mattress specialty retailers 
historically  we have satisfied these cash requirements from cash flows provided by our operations and availability under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility 
historically  we have collected payment from our customers at or near the time of sale  and  as such  we do not carry significant accounts receivable balances from our customers 
many of our suppliers deliver product to our distribution centers within hours following our placement of a purchase order  which allows us to carry lower inventory levels 
we pay the majority of our vendors for our purchases on terms that  on average  allow us to collect payments on the sale of our products before we must pay our vendors 
the attributes of our operating cycle lower our working capital requirements and have historically allowed us to operate for extended periods while maintaining a negative working capital position 
our future capital requirements will vary based on the number of additional stores  including relocated stores  we open and the number of stores we choose to renovate  and the number and size of any acquisitions we choose to make  including franchisee acquisitions 
our decisions regarding opening  relocating or renovating stores  and whether to engage in strategic acquisitions  are based in part on macroeconomic factors and the general state of the us economy  as well as the local economies in the markets in which our stores are located 
we plan to spend approximately million to million in capital expenditures during fiscal  including estimated costs to complete the rebranding and renovation of stores from the recent acquisitions 
we are permitted to spend up to million per year in capital expenditures under the terms of the senior credit facility 
the permitted amount may be increased for any year by the 
table of contents amount of equity capital that is contributed to mattress holding corp 
during the year for that purpose 
in addition  to the extent capital expenditures made in any year are less than the permitted amount  the amount of the shortfall in that year may increase the permitted amount of capital expenditures for the immediately succeeding but not any subsequent year 
we can also utilize the permitted amount from the following year to increase the permitted amount in the current year with a reduction in the following year permitted amount 
we believe the permitted amount of capital expenditures under our senior credit facility is in excess of our expected capital expenditure requirements for fiscal we believe that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements for the next twelve months  including supporting our existing operations  continuing our growth strategy  and satisfying our scheduled debt service payments  through a combination of our existing reserves of cash and cash equivalents  internally generated cash flows from operations  and  as required  borrowings under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility 
the revolving portion of the senior credit facility allows us to borrow up to million  of which up to million is available for issuance as letters of credit 
there were million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility as of january  on january   outstanding letters of credit under the revolving facility were million  resulting in million of available borrowings as of such date 
the million revolving credit facility portion of the senior credit facility matures on january  in addition  we had million of cash and cash equivalents as of january   compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of january  subsequent to january   we repaid million of revolving borrowings and  as of april  there were million in outstanding revolving borrowings and million of available borrowings 
during fiscal and fiscal  we utilized net operating loss carryforwards generated in prior years to reduce a significant portion of our federal and state income tax requirements 
the remainder of those prior year net operating loss carryforwards were fully utilized to offset a portion of taxable income during fiscal  resulting in an increase in the cash requirements for income taxes of million  as compared with fiscal we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards at january  that begin expiring in fiscal  if not utilized to offset future taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards arose from the acquisition of mghc holding corporation  and after application of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  are limited to an average use of million per year over the next five years  unless we undergo a more than ownership change within the meaning of the code  which may limit our ability to utilize pre change losses 
we expect that our cash requirements for income taxes will increase significantly during fiscal due to the significant reduction in net operating loss carryforwards available to us in future periods 
debt service as of january   we had total indebtedness of million 
the components of our debt as of january  were as follows amounts in thousands senior credit facility other total long term debt senior credit facility on january   mattress holding corp  an indirect consolidated subsidiary of ours  entered into a credit agreement with ubs securities llc and certain of its affiliates and other lenders for a senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility  which was amended on november  as amended  the senior credit facility 
the amendment  among other things  i increased the revolving loan commitment from million to million  
table of contents ii extended the maturity date of the revolving loan by two years to january  iii extended the maturity date of outstanding term loans having an aggregate principal amount of million by two years to january extended term loans  iv increased the interest rate applicable to amounts outstanding under the extended term loans and revolving loans by  v increased the amount of permitted capital expenditures to million on an annual basis  beginning with capital expenditures incurred during fiscal  and vi increased the maximum cumulative amount that mattress holding corp 
and its subsidiary guarantors may incur for permitted acquisitions through the extended maturity date 
we incurred fees in connection with the amendment of approximately million 
certain holders of term loans with an outstanding balance of million at january  did not elect to extend the original january maturity date in connection with the november  amendment non extended term loans 
as of january   the senior credit facility consisted of i a million term loan with outstanding term borrowings of million and ii million of outstanding borrowings under a million revolving credit facility maturing on january   which includes a million letter of credit subfacility and a million swingline loan subfacility 
at january   there was approximately million in outstanding letters of credit  resulting in remaining availability under the revolving credit facility of million 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus  at our option  either i a base rate determined by reference to the highest of a the corporate base rate of interest established by the administrative agent and b the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus  or ii the london interbank offered rate  or libor  determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs 
the applicable margin percentages for extended term loans are for base rate loans and for libor loans 
the applicable margin percentages for non extended term loans are for base rate loans and for libor loans 
the applicable margin percentages for revolving loans are for base rate loans and for libor loans 
swingline loans bear interest at an interest rate equal to the interest rate for base rate loans  and as of january   no such borrowings were outstanding 
on the last day of each quarter  we also pay a commitment fee payable in arrears in respect of any unused commitments under the revolving credit facility  subject to adjustment based upon the level of the total leverage ratio which varies from to 
as of january   the commitment fee was 
we also pay fees for the issuance and maintenance of letters of credit 
outstanding term borrowings under the senior credit facility are payable in quarterly principal installments of million in fiscal and quarterly principal installments of million in fiscal and fiscal in addition  non extended term loans in aggregate principal amount of approximately million mature on january  accrued interest on outstanding borrowings is payable from time to time and no less frequently than quarterly 
furthermore  we are subject to an annual mandatory principal prepayment in an amount equal to a portion of excess cash flow  as defined in the senior credit facility  payable no later than days after the end of each fiscal year 
such prepayments are first applied to reduce scheduled quarterly principal repayments for the next four quarters in order of maturity and then to reduce future quarterly payments through maturity on a pro rata basis 
we made an excess cash flow payment in the amount of million on june   with respect to excess cash flows related to fiscal no excess cash flow payments were required with respect to the operations in fiscal and fiscal there are other mandatory prepayment requirements  subject to certain exceptions  from the net cash proceeds of certain asset sale and casualty and condemnation events  subject to reinvestment rights  from the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of certain debt  other than debt permitted under the senior credit facility  and from the net cash proceeds of specified issuances of preferred equity securities 
no such prepayments 
table of contents were required in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal we may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the senior credit facility at any time without premium or penalty  other than customary breakage costs with respect to libor loans 
other indebtedness 
our subsidiaries have various notes payable related to the purchase mattress x press and of equipment totaling million that bear interest at  with monthly principal and interest payments of various amounts through notes payable for financing of equipment purchases are collateralized by certain equipment with carrying amounts that approximate the outstanding principal balances of the related notes payable as of january  covenant compliance we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants required under the senior credit facility and our other indebtedness as of january  we believe that we will be able to maintain compliance with the various covenants required under our debt agreements for the next twelve months without amending any of the debt agreements or requesting waivers from the lenders that are party to the debt agreements 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition sales revenue  including fees collected for delivery services  is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of mattresses and bedding products by the company customers and is recorded net of returns 
customer deposits collected prior to the delivery of merchandise are recorded as a liability 
the company accrues a liability for estimated sales returns and exchanges in the period that the related sales are recognized 
the company provides its customers with a comfort satisfaction guarantee whereby the customer may return or exchange the original mattress anytime during days from the date of original purchase 
mattresses received back are reconditioned pursuant to state law and resold through the company clearance center stores as used merchandise 
the company accrues a liability for the estimated costs  net of estimated restocking fees  related to the diminishment in value of the returned merchandise at the time the sale is recognized based upon historical experience 
the liability for sales returns and sales exchanges is included in other accrued liabilities 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties in that management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future sales returns and exchanges and the associated costs 
effective august  we revised our return and exchange policy to enable our customers to return products for any reason up to days after the purchase date for either a full refund or exchange credit without the incurrence of exchange or other fees 
the policy is referred to as the happiness guarantee 
prior to this new policy  a customer could exchange a mattress for a similar mattress from days to days from the original purchase date  subject to a restocking fee  although the restocking fee could be waived at the discretion of the sales associate 
the happiness guarantee has resulted in an increased amount of returns and exchanges 
the increased activity and the elimination of exchange fee collections will continue to increase the estimated cost of sales returns and exchanges 
we have not made any material changes in the policy we use to measure the estimated liability for sales returns and exchanges 
the happiness guarantee has resulted in an increase in such costs and we will review and revise our estimates as additional experience is obtained 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions vendor incentives cash payments received from vendors as incentives to enter into or to maintain long term supply arrangements  including payments received in connection with the opening of new stores  are deferred and amortized as a reduction of cost of sales using a systematic approach 
payments received from vendors in connection with new store openings are deferred and amortized over months  which is the estimated period over which the incentives are earned 
vendor incentives that are based on a percentage of the cost of purchased merchandise  such as cooperative advertising funds  are accounted for as a reduction of the price of the vendor products and result in a reduction of cost of sales when the merchandise is sold 
vendor incentives that are direct reimbursements of costs incurred by the company to sell the vendor products are accounted for as a reduction of the related costs when recognized in the company results of operations 
certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that require minimum purchase volumes and may provide for increased incentives when graduated purchase volumes are met 
amounts accrued as vendor receivables throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes 
we have not made any material changes in the policy we use to recognize vendor receivables during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially  either positively or negatively  impact our gross profit and inventory valuation 
however  substantially all receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal year and all amounts deferred against inventory turnover within the following fiscal year are realized 
as a result  subjective long term estimates are not required 
adjustments to our gross profit and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 
self insured liabilities we are self insured for certain losses related to employee health and workers compensation liability claims 
however  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims 
when estimating our self insured liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party actuaries 
periodically  we review our assumptions and the valuation provided by independent third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
our self insurance liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
we have not made any material changes in the policy we use to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we assign the carrying value of these intangible assets to their reporting units and apply the impairment test at the reporting unit level 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm  as appropriate 
the test for goodwill impairment involves a qualitative evaluation as to whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances 
if any reporting unit is concluded to be more likely impaired than not the following steps are performed for such reporting unit comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets and if the carrying value exceeds fair value  the fair value of goodwill is compared with the respective carrying value and an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
the impairment test for indefinite lived assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset establishes the new accounting basis 
we determine enterprise fair value by reference to our publicly traded stock price or by using widely accepted valuation techniques  including the income approach and the market approach 
these types of valuation techniques contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
enterprise value is allocated to each reporting unit based on a systematic rationale and consistent methodology  which takes into consideration the relative operating performance of each reporting unit as determined by historical and expected future operating results based upon management estimates 
the impairment test for goodwill is applied to the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment and one level below a segment  a component 
each metropolitan market is a separate operating segment 
the store unit components that comprise each operating segment are aggregated within each operating segment as all of the stores have similar economic characteristics 
all of our goodwill has been allocated to our market level reporting units for impairment testing 
as we test goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  which is each company operated metropolitan market  we may be required to incur goodwill impairment charges based on adverse changes affecting a particular metropolitan market  regardless of overall performance 
such impairment charges may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the fair values of the majority of our reporting units  as determined by an allocation of total enterprise value to the reporting units based on a systematic rationale and consistent methodology  were substantially in excess of the related carrying values in the most recent impairment test performed as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimate or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions long lived assets long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our investment in store leasehold improvements  including fixtures and equipment  is the most significant long lived asset 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss based on the asset carrying value in excess of the asset estimated fair value 
the impairment review of long lived assets related to stores is evaluated at the individual store level 
the results of individual stores may deteriorate based on factors outside the control of the company  such as the proximity of competitors  shifting retail trade area demographics and other macro economic factors 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimated future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in the policy we use to assess impairment losses during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material charge in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
costs associated with location closings we lease the vast majority of our stores and other locations under long term leases and we occasionally vacate locations prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs eg  real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience  our analysis of the specific real estate market  including input from independent real estate firms  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
we do not discount cash flows in estimating the liability recorded for location closures 
the liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future settlement payments  and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 
when making these assumptions  management considers a number of factors  including the historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the policy we use to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years 
a change in our location closing liability at january   would have affected net income by less than million in fiscal 
table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions acquisitions purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting for business acquisitions  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded to goodwill  which is assigned to reporting units 
our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including the income approach and the market approach 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
we typically engage an independent valuation firm to assist in estimating the fair value of significant assets and liabilities of acquired businesses 
the total amount of goodwill arising from an acquisition may be assigned to one or more reporting units in situations where the acquired business consists of specialty mattress retail operations in multiple metropolitan markets or when other reporting units are expected to benefit from synergies of the acquisition 
the method of assigning goodwill to reporting units is reasonable and supportable and applied in a consistent manner and may involve estimates and assumptions 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities for those acquisitions completed in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
the amounts of goodwill assigned to reporting units may give rise to goodwill impairment charges in future periods based upon the operating results of the reporting units relative to other reporting units and the resulting effect on the allocation of enterprise value to reporting units for goodwill impairment testing 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions product warranties pursuant to certain of our negotiated supply agreements we are responsible for manufacturer service warranties and any extended warranties we may offer 
the customer is not charged a fee for warranty coverage 
we accrue for the estimated cost of warranty coverage at the time the sale is recognized 
in estimating the liability for product warranties  we consider the impact of recoverable salvage value on the product received back under warranty 
based upon our historical warranty claims experience  as well as recent trends that might suggest that past experience may differ from future claims  we periodically review and adjust  if necessary  the liability for product warranties 
if our actual claims during the period are materially different than our provision for warranty claims  our results could be materially and adversely affected 
during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes to the methodology we use to establish our reserves for warranty claims 
we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to establish our provision for warranty claims 
however  if actual warranty claims are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our warranty liability at january   would have affected net income by less than million in fiscal 
table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected on the balance sheet for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes that will reverse in subsequent years 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are estimated to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income or expense in the period that the change is effective 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
in estimating the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  we are required to make judgments about the tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are estimated to be realized or settled 
in addition  we are also required to make estimates about the valuation allowances that we carry against our deferred tax assets in order to bring them to their net realizable value 
finally  our estimates of reserves related to potential tax exposures when it is more likely than not that a taxing authority will take a sustainable position that is contrary to ours requires significant judgment 
during fiscal  we determined that it was more likely than not that of the deferred tax benefit related to our net operating losses nols would not be realized in future periods  as such  we recognized a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 
as of january   we determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  the change in valuation allowance of million  through the combination of current year operations and the valuation allowance release due to our determination that the realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not  resulted in a benefit to deferred tax expense in our statement of operations 
we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to establish our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions stock based compensation for all stock based awards  we measure compensation cost at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period in which the awards are expected to vest 
eligible employees were granted stock options at an exercise price equal to the grant day closing price of our common stock 
a portion of the stock options granted to the company employees are subject to a five year time based vesting schedule  while the remaining portion of the stock options are subject to a four year market based vesting schedule  with such vesting based on specified stock price increase targets  as set forth in the option award agreement evidencing the grant of such stock options 
in addition non employee independent directors and certain of our employees were granted restricted stock with a fair value equal to our closing stock price on the date of grant 
the grants to non employee independent directors vest over one year  while the restricted stock granted to certain of our employees vest over three years 
the company estimates the fair value of stock awards granted pursuant to the omnibus plan based upon the nature of the awards 
stock options that vest based upon the passage of time are valued using a black scholes option pricing model  which utilizes assumptions for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  stock price volatility and weighted average expected term 
stock options that include additional market vesting conditions are valued using a monte carlo simulation approach  which utilizes similar input assumptions as the black scholes option pricing model  plus a suboptimal exercise factor 
the assumptions involving stock price volatility and stock option term are subject to a higher degree of uncertainty due to the limited period of time that the company equity shares have been publicly traded and limited experience with stock option awards 
the company has utilized data of publicly traded peer companies to provide a reasonable basis for such assumptions and has applied the simplified method as permitted by sab and sab in determining the stock option term 
we have not made any material changes in the policy we use to estimate the fair value of stock based awards and the period over which compensation expense is recognized 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
in addition  if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
finally  if the actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the assumptions used  we could experience future earnings adjustments 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended january   would have affected net income by less than million in fiscal seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and we generally have experienced more sales and a greater portion of income during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to a concentration of summer season holidays  including memorial day  the fourth of july and labor day  and other seasonal factors 
while we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future  we also expect that the acquisitions we make and the timing of those acquisitions may have some effect on the impact of these seasonal fluctuations 

table of contents summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods amounts in thousands payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total long term debt  including principal and interest operating leases operating contracts letters of credit total future contractual obligations on the senior credit facility reflect the company current interest rate  which is based on libor plus on the majority of the outstanding debt balance 
does not include certain other expenses required to be paid by the company under such operating leases  comprised primarily of the company proportionate share of common area maintenance  property taxes and insurance 
these other expenses have typically amounted to approximately of the base rent expense during recent fiscal years 
we have certain operating contracts related to sponsorships and space rentals at special event venues 
we have outstanding letters of credit at january   which expire at varying times through  including million that are subject to automatic renewal for an additional one year period on the anniversary date of the agreement  unless we receive notice from the counterparty that the letter of credit agreement has been terminated at least days prior to the automatic renewal date 
we have million of reserves for uncertain tax positions that are based on potential exposures when it is considered more likely than not that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we cannot determine what date  if at all  the million reserve will result in an obligation that must be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued new guidance regarding fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the new guidance applies to all reporting entities that are required or permitted to measure or disclose the fair value of an asset  a liability  or an instrument classified in a reporting entity stockholders equity in the financial statements 
the new guidance applies prospectively to periods beginning after december  
table of contents we adopted the provisions of the new guidance effective february  and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
this guidance provides the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either one single statement or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and other comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of the new guidance effective february  and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued new guidance which gives companies the option to perform an annual qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  and in some cases  bypass the two step impairment test 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   however  early adoption of the new guidance is permitted 
we adopted this guidance effective august  and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense on borrowings under the senior credit facility with interest rates that vary in direct relationship to changes in the prime interest rate or libor 
our floating rate indebtedness was approximately million at january  if short term floating interest rates increased by basis points during the prior twelve months  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during that year 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding and cash equivalent balances for fiscal impact of inflation 
we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for any fiscal year during the three year period ended january  we cannot be sure that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition in future periods
