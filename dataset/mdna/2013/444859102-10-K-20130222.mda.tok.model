item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled health insurance reform 
business segments we manage our business with three reportable segments retail  employer group  and health and well being services 
in addition  the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles 
these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well being solutions for our health plans and other customers  as described below 
these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 
the retail segment consists of medicare and commercial fully insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits  including dental  vision  and other supplemental health and financial protection products  marketed directly to individuals 
the employer group segment consists of medicare and commercial fully insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits  including dental  vision  and other supplemental health and financial protection products  as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups 
the health and well being services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness  including provider services  pharmacy  integrated wellness  and home care services 
the other businesses category consists of our military services  primarily our tricare south region contract  medicaid  and closed block long term care businesses as well as our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition program  or the li net program 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our health and well being services segment  primarily pharmacy  behavioral health  and provider services  to our retail and employer group customers 
intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation 
members served by our segments often utilize the same provider networks  enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share indirect costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
we allocate most operating expenses to our segments 
assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments  including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations  interest expense on corporate debt  and certain other corporate expenses 
these items are managed at the corporate level 
these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment eliminations 
our products our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted 
these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage 
health maintenance organizations  or hmos  generally require a referral from the member s primary care provider before seeing certain specialty physicians 
preferred provider organizations  or ppos  provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral 
however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo s network 
point of service  or pos  plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans 
in general  pos plans allow members to choose  at the time medical services are needed  to seek care from a provider within the plan s network or outside the network 
in addition  we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness  including pharmacy  provider services  integrated wellness  and home care services 
at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model  which unites quality care  high member engagement  
table of contents and sophisticated data analytics 
our approach to primary  physician directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent  integrated  cost effective  and member focused 
the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole  while offering our members a simple  seamless healthcare experience 
the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 
our retail segment products this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows 
the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december  retail segment premiums and services revenue percent of consolidated premiums and services revenue dollars in millions premiums individual medicare advantage individual medicare stand alone pdp total individual medicare individual commercial individual specialty total premiums services total premiums and services revenue individual medicare we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over years and have established a national presence  offering at least one type of medicare plan in all states 
we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers 
we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making cost effective decisions with respect to their health care 
we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 
medicare is a federal program that provides persons age and over and some disabled persons under the age of certain hospital and medical insurance benefits 
cms  an agency of the united states department of health and human services  administers the medicare program 
hospitalization benefits are provided under part a  without the payment of any premium  for up to days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating days 
eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b 
beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under original medicare are still required to pay out of pocket deductibles and coinsurance 
throughout this document this program is referred to as original medicare 
as an alternative to original medicare  in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program  medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c 
pursuant to medicare part c  medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under original medicare 
our medicare advantage plans are discussed more fully below 
prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

table of contents individual medicare advantage products we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits  including wellness programs  to medicare eligible persons under hmo  ppo  and private fee for service  or pffs  plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms  usually a fixed payment per member per month 
with each of these products  the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of original medicare  typically including reduced cost sharing  enhanced prescription drug benefits  care coordination  data analysis techniques to help identify member needs  complex case management  tools to guide members in their health care decisions  care management programs  wellness and prevention programs and  in some instances  a reduced monthly part b premium 
most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan  subject to cost sharing and other limitations 
accordingly  all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our stand alone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans 
medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicare covered services or for certain extra benefits 
generally  medicare eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october and december for coverage that begins on the following january our medicare hmo and ppo plans  which cover medicare eligible individuals residing in certain counties  may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in network providers or in emergency situations 
except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan  most hmo plans provide no out of network benefits 
ppo plans carry an out of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost sharing 
in some cases  these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 
on january   most of our members enrolled in pffs plans transitioned to networked based ppo type products due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks  except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two network based medicare advantage plans 
our medicare pffs plans generally have no preferred network 
individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to original medicare payment rates 
cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans 
these rates are adjusted under cms s risk adjustment model which uses health status indicators  or risk scores  to improve the accuracy of payment 
the risk adjustment model  which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of bipa  generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the risk adjustment payments 
under the risk adjustment methodology  all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 
at december   we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately  individual medicare advantage members  including approximately  members in florida 
these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately billion  which represented approximately of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue  or of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december  our hmo and ppo products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august of the calendar year in which the contract would end  or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end

there were approximately million dual eligible individuals in the united states in these dual eligibles may enroll in a privately offered medicare advantage product  but may also receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits  such as nursing home care and or assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing
