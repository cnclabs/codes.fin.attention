item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
hospira continues to make improvements to its products to further reduce issues related to patient safety 
based upon consultations with the fda and other regulatory authorities  these improvements may require hospira to initiate recalls or corrective actions if the improvement reduces the health risk posed by the product and not making the improvements to the on market product is deemed a patient safety issue 
hospira sales and marketing activities for its products are also highly regulated 
regulatory authorities have the power to mandate the discontinuation of promotional materials  practices and programs that include information beyond the scope of the indications in the approved or cleared labeling or that are not in compliance with specific regulatory requirements 
some of hospira drug products are considered controlled substances and are subject to additional regulation by the us drug enforcement administration dea and various state and international authorities 
these drugs  which have varying degrees of potential for abuse  require specialized controls for production  storage and distribution to prevent theft and diversion 
hospira continues investing in the development of generic and or similar versions of currently marketed biopharmaceuticals 
since  the european medicines agency has implemented guidelines which provided a pathway for the approval of certain biosimilars in the european union 
in  the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca was passed and signed into law in the us this legislation includes new authorization for the fda to approve companies to market these products in the us in  the fda issued three draft guidance documents regarding biosimiliars  which have been incorporated into hospira biosimilar development plans 
hospira will continue to analyze and incorporate into its biosimilar development plans any additional regulations issued by the fda 
healthcare fraud and abuse laws as a manufacturer and distributor of prescription drugs and medical products to hospitals and other healthcare providers  hospira and its customers are subject to laws which apply to medicare  medicaid  and other federal and state healthcare programs in the us one such law  the anti kickback statute  prohibits the solicitation  offer  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referral or purchase  or in return for the recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase  of products covered by the programs 
the anti kickback statute provides a number of exceptions or safe harbors for particular types of transactions 
while hospira generally does not file claims for reimbursement from government payers  the us federal government has asserted theories of liability against manufacturers under the federal false claims act  which prohibits the submission of false claims to medicare  medicaid  and other state and federal programs 
many states have similar fraud and abuse laws which apply to hospira 
hospira has developed and implemented business practices and processes to support and monitor compliance with healthcare fraud and abuse laws 
anti bribery laws hospira global activities are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act us fcpa the us bribery act  and other countries anti bribery laws that have been enacted in support of the organization for economic cooperation and development anti bribery convention 
these laws prohibit companies and individuals from offering or providing anything of value to government officials with the intent to inappropriately gain a business advantage 
they also require companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal financial controls 
the uk bribery act also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for a company to fail to prevent bribery 
companies have the burden of proving that they have adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery 
the enforcement of such laws in the us and elsewhere has increased dramatically in the past few years  and authorities have indicated that the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is a significant focus for enforcement efforts 
hospira has a compliance program in place to ensure compliance with these laws by its employees and agents and to communicate its expectations of compliance to third parties  including its distributors and suppliers 
the anti bribery compliance program includes a risk assessment  policies and procedures that address significant aspects of anti bribery legislation and enforcement priorities  training and communication to employees in commercial and other positions  and monitoring and auditing of hospira facilities  commercial operations and third parties with whom hospira does business 
environmental laws hospira manufacturing operations are subject to many requirements under environmental laws 
in the us  the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws which restrict the emission of pollutants into the air  the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water and the disposal of hazardous substances 
the failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental laws 
most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental laws 
us laws also allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations 
outside the us  the environmental laws and their enforcement vary  and can be more burdensome 
for example  in some european countries  there are environmental taxes and laws requiring manufacturers to take back used products at the end of their useful life 
this does not currently have a significant impact on hospira products  but such laws are expanding rapidly in europe 
hospira has management systems in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violation of these laws 
other environmental laws address the contamination of land and groundwater  and require the clean up of such contamination 
hospira has been involved with a number of sites at which clean up has been required  some as the sole owner and responsible party  and some as a contributor in conjunction with other parties 
although hospira continues to make capital expenditures for environmental protection  hospira does not anticipate any significant expenditure in order to comply with such laws and regulations that would have a material impact on our operations  results or competitive position 
transparency laws in the us and other countries there are numerous requirements imposed by states in the us on pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
for example  several states and the district of columbia either require the tracking and reporting of specific types of interactions with healthcare professionals or restrict such interactions 
a similar requirement arose under the sunshine provision of ppaca to track and report spending on us physicians and teaching institutions 
it is expected that the sunshine provision will preempt some but not all of the state disclosure requirements 
hospira is developing and implementing systems and processes to ensure compliance with sunshine requirements 
other countries  including the u 
k and france  have adopted similar reporting requirements through legislation  regulation and or industry codes 
other laws hospira is also subject to a variety of other laws  directives and regulations in and outside of the us  including those related to the following the safety and health laws of the us occupational safety and health act  which sets forth requirements for workplace conditions  the laws administered by the us department of transportation and similar foreign agencies related to transporting materials defined as hazardous over land  sea  or through the air  and the customs  export and anti boycott laws of the us and foreign government agencies  including the us customs and border protection  the bureau of industry and security  the department of commerce and the office of foreign assets control treasury department  as well as others 
hospira uses reasonable care to stay abreast of  and plans for  proposed legislation that could significantly affect our operations

item a 
risk factors hospira business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
these risks and uncertainties may cause hospira sales and results of operations to fluctuate significantly  hospira past performance to not be indicative of future performance  and hospira actual performance to differ materially from hospira expectations or projections 
the risks described below may not be the only risks hospira faces 
additional risks that hospira does not yet know of or that hospira currently thinks are immaterial may also adversely impact or impair its business operations 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
hospira results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the following risks 
hospira faces significant competition and may not be able to compete effectively 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive 
hospira competes with many companies that range from small  highly focused companies to large diversified healthcare manufacturers that have access to greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
there has been consolidation by hospira competitors and customer base  which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures  causing competition to become more intense 
hospira present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by competitors or by the introduction of competing products by one or more of its competitors 
to remain competitive and bolster its competitive position  hospira believes that it must successfully execute various strategic plans  including expanding its research and development initiatives and productivity  globally expanding its portfolio of products  lowering its operating costs  and improving its quality and business processes 
these initiatives may result in significant expenditures and ultimately may not be successful 
if hospira global expansion efforts are unsuccessful  hospira may not be able to fully utilize its manufacturing footprint  which could result in certain asset impairments  customer accommodations  contract termination charges  restructuring  and other exit related charges 
hospira efforts to modernize and streamline its portfolio of on market medication management products could be significant 
hospira failure to compete effectively could cause it to lose market share to its competitors and have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability 
if hospira does not successfully introduce new products in a timely manner  its sales and operating results may decline 
a key component to hospira strategy is effective execution of its research and development activities 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  hospira products may become obsolete over time  causing its sales and operating results to suffer 
if hospira does not continue to develop generic injectable pharmaceuticals in a timely manner  its competitors may develop products that are more competitive than hospira  and hospira could find it more difficult to renew or expand group purchasing organizations gpo pricing agreements or to obtain new agreements 
the ability to launch a generic pharmaceutical product at or before generic market formation is important to that product profitability 
prices for generic products typically decline  sometimes dramatically  following market formation  as additional companies receive approvals to market that product and competition intensifies 
if a company can be first to market  such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period of time  higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved 
with increasing competition in the generic product market  the timeliness with which hospira can market new generic products will increase in importance 
if hospira is unable to bring its generic products to market on a timely basis  and secure first to market positions  its sales and profitability could be adversely impacted 
in addition  hospira may have fewer opportunities to launch significant generic products in the future  as the number and size of proprietary products that are subject to patent expirations or challenges are expected to decrease in the next several years compared to historical levels 
hospira faces similar risks if it does not introduce new versions or upgrades to its medication management portfolio 
innovations generally require a substantial investment in product development before hospira can determine their commercial viability  and hospira may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations 
even if hospira succeeds in creating new product candidates from these innovations  such innovations may still fail to result in commercially successful products 
the success of new product offerings for both pharmaceutical and device products will depend on several factors  including hospira ability to properly anticipate customer needs  obtain timely regulatory approvals  and manufacture quality products in an economic and timely manner 
even if hospira is able to successfully develop new products or enhancements  hospira may not produce sales equal to or greater than the costs of development or may not avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
such products may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
moreover  innovations may not become successful because of difficulties encountered in achieving positive clinical outcomes  meeting safety  efficacy or other regulatory requirements of government agencies  or obtaining favorable pricing on such products 
finally  innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of  among other things  entrenched patterns of clinical practice  and uncertainty over third party reimbursement 
the development  manufacture and sale of biosimilar products poses unique risks  and hospira failure to successfully introduce biosimilar products could have a negative impact on hospira business and future operating results 
hospira is actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products 
hospira has already launched two biosimilars  retacrit tm and nivestim tm  in several countries outside the us to augment its development program for biosimilars  in  hospira entered into an agreement to develop and market certain biosimilar molecules with celltrion  inc and celltrion healthcare  inc 
celltrion 
the success of hospira ability to commercialize products from the celltrion agreement will depend on the ability of celltrion to develop  manufacture and gain approval for its products 
for those biosimilar candidates that will be internally developed  hospira expects that the product development costs for each candidate could be up to million per biosimilar over a year period 
the cost to develop each biosimilar candidate could vary significantly and is highly dependent on the specific compound and the amount and type of clinical work that will be necessary for regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance that hospira clinical work will be successful 
moreover  hospira may enter into additional alliances and collaborations to fund research and development activities  and the success of the biosimilar program may depend on hospira ability to realize the benefits under such arrangements 
due to events beyond hospira control or the risks identified herein  hospira may not be able to fund all or some of its internal biosimilar research and development initiatives  which would have an adverse impact on hospira strategy and growth initiatives 
as described under the section captioned governmental regulation and other matters  in item  the patient protection and affordable care act legislation included new authorization for the fda to approve companies to market biosimilar products in the us although in  the fda issued draft guidance documents in furtherance of this new authorization  significant uncertainty remains concerning the regulatory pathway in the us to obtain regulatory approval of biosimilar products and the commercial pathway to successfully market and sell such products 
hospira will continue to analyze and incorporate into its biosimilar development plans any final regulations that are issued by the fda 
the costs of development and approval  along with the probability of success for hospira biosimilar candidates  will be dependent upon any final regulations issued by the relevant regulatory authorities 
moreover  biosimilar products will likely be subject to extensive patent clearances and patent infringement litigation  which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product for many years 
in addition  the development and manufacture of biosimilars pose unique risks related to the supply of the materials needed to manufacture biosimilars 
access to and the supply of necessary biological materials may be limited  and government regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials 
market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to patients  physicians and payers that such products are safe and efficacious compared to other existing products  yet offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies 
dependent upon the outcome of the foregoing risks  hospira may not be able to generate future sales of biosimilar products in certain jurisdictions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of its investments in the development  manufacture and sale of such products 
hospira issues with its quality systems and processes could have an adverse effect upon hospira business  subject hospira to further regulatory action and costly litigation  and cause a loss of confidence in hospira and its products 
hospira future operating results will depend on its ability to implement and improve its quality management program  and effectively train and manage its employee base with respect to quality management 
during the last few years  hospira has encountered several quality and product related issues  primarily related to fda warning letters and certain device remediation activities  which are described under the section captioned certain quality and product related matters in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
while hospira takes all of its quality matters seriously  hospira cannot give any assurances as to the expected date of resolution of all of these matters 
while hospira continues to work to resolve the remaining matters  there can be no assurance that additional costs or penalties will not be incurred  and that additional regulatory actions with respect to hospira will not occur 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that regulatory agencies or customers will be satisfied with hospira response and corrective actions 
until all of the matters are corrected  hospira may be subject to additional regulatory actions by the fda  including the receipt of additional form observations  warning letters  untitled letters  import and export bans or restrictions  the imposition of a consent decree  product recalls or seizures  injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution of products  monetary penalties  or other restrictions on operations 
in addition  new product approvals at any of hospira manufacturing facilities could be adversely impacted by these quality matters or any other adverse inspection results at hospira other facilities 
hospira has experienced delays in product approvals at its facilities  and dependent upon the outcomes of these matters and potential further regulatory actions  further delays in  or denials of product approvals could continue to impact hospira 
hospira inability to address quality or safety issues in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity  and a loss of customer confidence  which may result in the loss of sales for existing and new products  the loss of market share for these products  changes to customer buying patterns  loss of customers  and failure to negotiate advantageous pricing and purchasing arrangements with gpos 
due to the complexity and depth of the remediation activities  these matters have and may continue to adversely impact production  including causing further reduced production volumes  extended production downtime  inventory accumulation and or inventory loss due to spoilage  excess  obsolescence or products failing to meet specifications and quality standards 
these quality matters have and may continue to lead to further remediation activities  including third party oversight activities  product recalls  product life cycle management programs  or other corrective actions 
also due to the complexity of these quality and product matters and in conjunction with continuous improvement actions  activities may include rationalizing the product portfolio  evaluating non strategic assets and streamlining the manufacturing footprint  which may result in certain asset impairments  customer accommodations  contract termination charges  restructuring  and other exit related charges 
additionally  these quality matters have adversely impacted  and may impact further  hospira net sales and ability to market certain products in all segments 
these quality matters have resulted in  and may further result in  lower customer service levels and resulting higher customer backorders  customer accommodations and penalties for failure to supply products 
these matters have impacted  and may continue to further impact  hospira cash flows and results of operations 
the decrease in cash flows and results of operations could impact hospira ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenant included in hospira revolving credit facility or could limit hospira flexibility in pursuing its current strategic investments  including hospira capacity expansion initiatives in india  modernization efforts at existing facilities  biosimilar research and development programs  global product portfolio expansion efforts  or any other programs hospira decides to pursue 
hospira may have to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to fund quality initiatives  thereby reducing the cash flow for these other initiatives 
failure to effectively manage efforts or to realize the benefits under product development  collaboration  or other third party agreements may harm hospira business and profitability 
hospira collaborates with other companies for the development  regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing of new products in both the specialty injectable pharmaceutical and medication management product lines 
hospira has entered into agreements relating to the long term development and commercialization of proprietary and biosimilar products  which hospira views as an important long term opportunity for its specialty injectable pharmaceutical product line 
for further information related to these agreements  see the section captioned product development in item business of this report 
hospira ability to benefit from these arrangements will depend on its ability to successfully manage these arrangements and the performance of the other parties to these arrangements 
hospira and the other parties to these arrangements may not efficiently work together  leading to higher than anticipated costs and delays in important activities under the arrangements 
the other parties to these arrangements may not devote the resources that are required for the arrangement to be successful 
these arrangements are often governed by complex agreements that may be subject to differing interpretations by the parties  which may result in disputes 
the failure of these arrangements could harm hospira sales  product development efforts and profitability 
during and  hospira made certain advances to suppliers for the purchase of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients api or biosimilar products 
these advances are unsecured 
however  under certain circumstances  the advances are refundable 
hospira may not realize the expected benefits of such advances  or based upon the creditworthiness or other circumstances of the suppliers  may not receive a refund of the advance payments  which could adversely impact hospira results of operations 
hospira is subject to the cost containment efforts of wholesalers  distributors  third party payers and government organizations  which could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability 
hospira relies on drug wholesalers to assist in the distribution of its generic injectable pharmaceutical products 
while hospira has business arrangements in place with its major drug wholesalers  if hospira is required to pay fees not contemplated by its existing arrangements  hospira will incur additional costs to distribute its products  which may adversely impact hospira profitability 
hospira products and services are sold to hospitals and alternate site providers  such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third party payers  such as government programs  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
these third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services 
levels of reimbursement  if any  may be decreased in the future  and future healthcare reform legislation  regulations or changes to reimbursement policies of third party payers may otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of hospira products  which could have a material adverse effect on hospira sales and profitability 
in markets outside the us  hospira business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing as a result of the concentrated buying power of governments as principal customers and the use of bid and tender sales methods whereby hospira is required to submit a bid for the sale of its products 
hospira failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability in these markets 
if hospira is unable to obtain or maintain its gpo and integrated delivery networks idn pricing agreements  sales of its products could decline 
many existing and potential customers for hospira products have combined to form gpos and idns in an effort to lower costs 
gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors  and these negotiated prices are made available to a gpo or an idn affiliated hospitals and other members 
a small number of gpos influence a majority of sales to hospira hospital customers in the us failure to negotiate advantageous pricing and purchasing arrangements could cause hospira to lose market share to its competitors and have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability 
the quality and related supply issues that have impacted hospira business over the last few years could adversely impact hospira ability to negotiate advantageous pricing or purchasing arrangements 
hospira has pricing agreements for certain products with the major gpos in the us  including amerinet  inc  healthtrust purchasing group lp  medassets supply chain systems  llc  novation  llc  and premier purchasing partners  lp 
it is important for hospira to continue to maintain pricing arrangements with major gpos 
in order to maintain these relationships  hospira must offer a reliable supply of high quality  regulatory compliant products 
hospira also needs to maintain a broad product line and be price competitive 
several gpo contracts may be up for renewal or extension in a given year 
moreover  some of the agreements may be terminated on or days notice  while others may not be terminated without breach until the end of their contracted term 
if hospira is unable to renew or extend one or more of those contracts  or one or more of the contracts are terminated  and hospira cannot replace lost business  hospira sales and profitability will decline 
there has been consolidation among major gpos  and further consolidation may occur 
the effect of consolidation is uncertain  and may impair hospira ability to contract with gpos in the future 
the gpos also have a variety of business relationships with hospira competitors and may decide to enter into pricing agreements for  or otherwise prefer  products other than hospira 
while gpos negotiate incentives for members to purchase specified products from a given manufacturer or distributor  gpo pricing agreements allow customers to choose between the products covered by the arrangement and another manufacturer products  whether or not purchased under a negotiated pricing agreement 
as a result  hospira may face competition for its products even within the context of its gpo pricing agreements 
changes in the buying patterns of hospira customers could adversely affect hospira operating results 
during  sales through the four largest us wholesalers that supply products to many end users accounted for approximately of hospira global net sales 
hospira profitability may be impacted by changes in the buying patterns of these wholesalers or any other major distributor 
their buying patterns may change as a result of end use buyer purchasing decisions  end use customer demand  pricing  or other factors  which could adversely affect hospira results of operations 
hospira and its suppliers and customers are subject to various governmental regulations  and it could be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 
in addition  failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to sanctions which could adversely affect hospira business  results of operations and financial condition 
hospira products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda  and numerous other national  supranational  federal and state governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device  particularly from the fda and governmental authorities outside the us  can be costly and time consuming  and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis  if at all 
to ensure ongoing customer safety  regulatory agencies such as the fda may re evaluate their current approval processes and may impose additional requirements 
in addition  the fda and others may impose increased or enhanced regulatory inspections for domestic or foreign plants 
the fda  along with other regulatory agencies around the world  has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug and medical device applications  which has delayed approvals of new products 
these delays have become longer  and may continue to increase in the future 
these delays can result in higher levels of unapproved inventory and increased costs due to excess and obsolescence exposures 
in addition  hospira may incur additional costs in connection with new regulations covering user fees for generics  biosimilars or devices 
in  the fda issued a draft guidance document entitled total product life cycle infusion pump premarket notification 
k 
submissions 
through this draft guidance  the fda has established additional pre market requirements for infusion pumps 
at the same time  the fda is also generally enhancing its pre market requirements for medical devices 
although hospira cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives  it appears that the process for obtaining regulatory approvals to market infusion pumps and medical devices will become more costly and time consuming 
in addition  the new requirements could result in longer delays for the approval of new products as well as remediation of existing products in the market 
future delays in the receipt of  or failure to obtain  approvals could result in delayed or no realization of product revenues 
hospira and its collaborative partners and suppliers may not be able to remain in compliance with applicable fda and other material regulatory requirements once it has obtained clearance or approval for a product 
these requirements include  among other things  regulations regarding manufacturing practices  product labeling  off label marketing  advertising and postmarketing reporting  adverse event reports and field alerts 
in addition  manufacturing flaws  component failures  design defects  off label uses or inadequate disclosure of product related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient 
hospira and its partners or suppliers may be required by regulatory authorities  or hospira may determine on its own  to issue a safety alert  recall or to temporarily cease production and sale of certain products in order to resolve manufacturing and product quality concerns 
all of these events could harm hospira sales  margins and profitability in the affected periods and may have a material adverse effect on hospira business 
hospira is also subject to various federal  state  and foreign laws pertaining to foreign corrupt practices and healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including  in some instances  substantial fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in national  federal and state healthcare programs  including medicare  medicaid  and veterans administration health programs and health programs outside the us these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations  which could require hospira to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices 
in addition  violations of these laws  or allegations of such violations  could disrupt hospira business and result in a material adverse effect on hospira sales  profitability and financial condition 
in august  the sec adopted a new rule requiring disclosure of specified minerals  known as conflict minerals  that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies 
the new rule  which is effective for calendar year reporting and requires a disclosure report to be filed by may   will require companies to disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country 
the new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of hospira products 
the number of suppliers who provide conflict free minerals may be limited 
in addition  there may be significant costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements  such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in hospira products  as well as costs and delays associated with possible changes to products  processes  regulatory approvals  or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification and or potential supplier change activities 
since hospira supply chain is complex  hospira may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products  which may harm its reputation 
in addition  hospira may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of its products be certified as conflict free  which could place hospira at a competitive disadvantage if hospira is unable to do so  or is only able to do so at a higher price 
for a more detailed listing of the laws and regulations that significantly affect hospira business and operations  see the section captioned governmental regulation and other matters in item business of this report 
any adverse regulatory action  or action taken by hospira to maintain appropriate regulatory compliance  with respect to these laws and regulations could disrupt hospira business and have a material adverse effect on its sales  profitability and financial condition 
furthermore  an adverse regulatory action with respect to any hospira product  operating procedure or manufacturing facility could materially harm hospira reputation in the marketplace 
the loss of key personnel could harm hospira business 
hospira failure to hire or retain personnel with the right expertise and experience in operations that are critical to its business functions could adversely impact the execution of its business strategy 
during and  hospira made a number of changes to its senior management team to advance hospira strategic initiatives to improve quality and globally expand 
the success of these initiatives and its business operations generally  will depend  to a significant extent  upon the experience  abilities and continued services of key management personnel 
hospira cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain key personnel or maintain key relationships  or that the costs of retaining such personnel or maintaining such relationships will not materially increase 
hospira may acquire businesses and assets  license rights to technologies or products from third parties  form alliances  or dispose of businesses and assets  and any of these actions may not result in the expected benefits or may not be completed in a timely or cost effective manner  or at all 
as part of hospira business strategy  hospira may acquire other businesses and assets  license rights to technologies or products from third parties  form alliances  or dispose of businesses and assets  and any of these actions may not be completed in a timely or cost effective manner  or at all 
hospira also may pursue strategic alliances to expand its product offerings and geographic presence 
hospira may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner  on a cost effective basis  or at all  and may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition  license arrangement  strategic alliance  or disposition 
other companies  including those with substantially greater resources  may compete with hospira for opportunities 
if hospira is successful in securing certain opportunities  the products and technologies that hospira acquires may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated 
hospira may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business 
hospira may incur greater than expected costs in connection with these transactions if it encounters difficulties or issues not known to it at the time of entering into the transaction 
in addition  hospira may enter markets in which it has no or limited prior experience 
hospira could experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition related charges 
any of these negative effects could cause a downgrade of hospira credit rating  which would affect hospira ability to obtain new financing and negatively impact hospira cost of financing and credit 
hospira may require financing in the future to make acquisitions or other investments  and such financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
hospira currently has outstanding billion of senior unsecured notes 
hospira also has a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in october hospira may need to incur additional debt in the future to finance acquisitions  for use in its operations  or to make other investments  including investments in certain quality and product related matters  continuous improvement activities  modernizing and streamlining activities  and product development 
in addition  hospira will need to maintain adequate liquidity  or may need to refinance its existing debt  to extinguish the million principal amount of notes due in june and the million principal amount of notes due in may for a complete description of hospira long term debt  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in
