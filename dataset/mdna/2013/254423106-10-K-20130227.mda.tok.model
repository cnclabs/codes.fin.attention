business overview the company the first international house of pancakes restaurant opened in in toluca lake  california 
shortly thereafter  the company predecessor began developing and franchising additional restaurants 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in with the name ihop corp 
in november  the company completed the acquisition of applebee international  inc  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
effective june   the name of the company was changed to dineequity  inc dineequity  we or our 
through various subsidiaries see exhibit  subsidiaries of dineequity  inc we own  franchise and operate two restaurant concepts applebee neighborhood grill bar applebee  in the bar and grill segment of the casual dining category of the restaurant industry  and international house of pancakes ihop  in the family dining category of the restaurant industry 
references herein to applebee and ihop restaurants are to these two restaurant concepts  whether operated by franchisees  area licensees or the company 
domestically  ihop restaurants are located in all states and the district of columbia  while applebee restaurants are located in every state except hawaii 
internationally  ihop restaurants are located in two united states territories and five foreign countries  applebee restaurants are located in one united states territory and foreign countries 
with over  restaurants combined  we believe we are the largest full service restaurant company in the world 
our vision to become the preferred franchisor of choice and deliver maximum franchisee and shareholder value 
our mission to unite great franchisees  iconic brands and team members to create the world leading restaurant company one guest at a time 
to achieve this mission  our strategies are designed to ensure strong brands  drive profitable  organic growth  identify and exploit complementary concepts and extensions  and create and monetize new value added services 
highlights marked the fifth anniversary of bringing together two of the world most iconic dining brands under one enterprise 
the highlight of this anniversary year was the achievement of our vision of becoming a franchised company with the completion of refranchising the vast majority of the company owned restaurants operated by applebee s when we closed the acquisition five years ago 
we believe a highly franchised business model requires less capital investment and general and administrative overhead  generates higher gross profit margins and reduces the volatility of free cash flow performance  as compared to a model based on operating a significant number of company owned restaurants 
other highlights of our fiscal performance include reducing our long term debt by million  which lowered our consolidated leverage ratio to at december  from at december  the reduction primarily came from a combination of after tax cash proceeds and elimination of financing obligations from the refranchising of applebee company operated restaurants and from our free cash flow  increasing applebee domestic same restaurant sales by during  the third consecutive year of same restaurant sales growth 
applebee same restaurant sales have increased in nine of the last ten quarters  opening new restaurants worldwide by ihop franchisees and area licensees and new restaurants by applebee franchisees 
ihop international footprint was expanded with franchise openings in the middle east and the dominican republic  remodeling over restaurants system wide during applebee and its franchisees remodeled restaurants during  while ihop and its franchisees remodeled restaurants 
over the past two years  of applebee restaurants and approximately one third of ihop restaurants have been remodeled  executing a comprehensive restructuring of general and administrative functions that will reduce future costs 
while the severance costs associated with headcount reductions exceeded savings in fiscal  we estimate these actions will save approximately million to million on a annualized basis in the future  and establishing new centers of excellence to pool talent from across our organization to realize synergies  share best practices and eliminate duplication of effort 
key performance indicators in evaluating and assessing the performance of our business  we consider our key performance indicators to be i the percentage change in domestic system wide same restaurant sales  ii net franchise restaurant development  iii consolidated cash from operations  and iv consolidated free cash flow 
an overview of our performance in these metrics is as follows applebee ihop percentage change in domestic system wide same restaurant sales net franchise restaurant development franchise and area license openings  net of closings and the refranchising of applebee company operated restaurants and two rehabilitated and refranchised ihop restaurants for the year ended december   our consolidated cash from operations was million and our consolidated free cash flow was million 
we achieved mixed results on these metrics in applebee achieved an increase in domestic system wide same restaurant sales for the third consecutive year 
applebee cumulative increase over those three years is  a significant achievement in light of the headwinds we faced as the country and our guests recovered from the economic crisis 
ihop  on the other hand  had a decline in its domestic system wide same restaurant sales for the second consecutive year  although the decline in was less than in ihop franchisees and area licensees opened new franchise restaurants in  with net openings openings less closings and refranchisings of restaurants 
over the past three years  ihop has achieved net openings  an annual growth rate of nearly 
applebee franchisees opened new franchise restaurants in  with net openings of restaurants 
over the past three years  applebee net openings totaled restaurants  an annual growth rate of under 
both cash from operations and free cash flow decreased approximately from the prior year 
the majority of the decline was the expected result of the refranchising of applebee company operated restaurants in terms of both restaurant operating profit foregone and payment of taxes on gains from the sale of restaurant assets 
while proceeds from asset sales are an investing cash inflow  all income taxes paid are an operating cash outflow 
additional information on each of these metrics is presented under the captions restaurant data  company restaurant operations and liquidity and capital resources below 
key overall strategies dineequity key strategies with the completion of our refranchising initiative  dineequity is continuing with its efforts to drive shareholder and franchisee value 
we have an ongoing program to leverage core competencies across the entire enterprise that is focused on three primary goals optimize organization capability  drive profitable organic growth  and reduce costs for both ourselves and our franchisees 
we have a fundamentally differentiated approach to brand management that centers on the powerful and strategic combination of marketing  menu  operations and remodel initiatives that creates a distinctive and relevant connection with our guests 
additionally  our shared services operating platform allows our brands to focus on key factors that drive the business while leveraging the resources and expertise of our scalable  centralized support structure 
we believe this is a competitive point of difference 
together  this closely integrated approach is expected to result in strong brand performance that drives dineequity growth and delivers results for our shareholders 
applebee key strategies we are revitalizing the applebee brand 
applebee domestic system wide same restaurant sales increased in this was applebee third year of increased same restaurant sales and we outpaced our group of competitors 
we are growing by executing on the following key strategies i drive profitable sales and traffic  ii invest in process and product innovation  iii transform the business  and iv improve margins and restaurant level economics 
drive profitable sales and traffic continued focus on meeting the consumer need for value throughout  with such promotions as the return of our successful sizzling entr es starting at nationwide  the introduction of our fresh flavors of the season  and the rotation of new products into our for offering 
we ended the year with spirited cuisine featuring our new napa chicken and portobellos and highly popular new brew pub pretzels beer cheese dip  continued innovation of the menu 
since the acquisition in  more than of applebee menu now consists of either new offerings or improved offerings with high quality ingredients  continued our unique healthy food offerings by refreshing our under calorie menu in january  which combined with our weight watchers menu has established us as a category leader in providing healthy dining options to our guests  and focused on late night business through beverage and appetizer innovation and local restaurant marketing efforts 
invest in process and product innovation we continue to invest in and drive innovation at applebee from both a product and process perspective 
we maintain a significant test and implementation focus to both develop and discover new trends and opportunities within the casual dining segment and beyond 
our history of innovation is readily apparent in our continual evolution of limited time product offerings as well as core menu items 
we take a similar approach to evaluation of media strategies and consumer touch points transform the business in june  we rolled out connections  the new comprehensive restaurant revitalization program involving people  place and promotional aspects 
the people aspect involves re training and re certification for kitchen staff and team members 
the place aspect involves exterior and interior modifications to the restaurant to signal change 
the promotional aspect involves a local public relations and marketing plan to re connect with the neighborhood 
our franchisees have embraced this initiative and by year end  over of the restaurants in the domestic system have been revitalized 
the company achieved its strategy to transition to a franchise operated applebee system in which includes buyers who are financially qualified  share our vision for revitalizing the applebee brand  are willing to invest in the business  and have well qualified management teams 
during  we refranchised company operated restaurants 
this highly franchised business model is expected to require less capital investment and general and administrative overhead  improve overall segment profit margins and reduce the volatility of cash flow performance 
improve margins and restaurant level economics we have continued to build upon process and system improvements deployed in prior years by improving our operating metrics 
food inventory management and labor efficiencies were realized during the first half of in company operated restaurants 
these operational improvements helped mitigate the impact of increasing commodity costs and higher payroll expense 
we continued to reap the benefits of our supply chain co op by leveraging our scale to manage through commodity cost inflation  which was also mitigated by the realignment of our distribution centers in with our transition to a franchised system  restaurant operating margin at the remaining company operated restaurants will become less impactful to our results of operations 
given that the primary focus of these restaurants in the future will be to test new products and processes  their operating margin as a percentage of sales is expected to decline 
however  we will continue to invest in product and process innovation to help our franchisees maintain and improve their restaurant level economics for the overall financial well being of the overall applebee system 
we continue to monitor our franchisees through our franchisee operations rating system  which provides visibility concerning their performance in relation to guest experience  food safety and training 
in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive casual dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results 
ihop key strategies to re ignite growth we have been pursuing key initiatives within the three pillars of our strategic framework re energize and grow the ihop brand  improve operations performance  and optimize franchise development 
re energize and grow the ihop brand to re energize and grow the ihop brand  we are implementing several key initiatives enhancing our menu  increasing media effectiveness and improving our advertising 
we continuously evolve our menu to maximize consumer acceptance  ease of use and appeal of the individual items offered 
this is an ongoing and continuous process 
the expanded simple and fit line of items with less than calories and signature pancakes line of items are recent examples of this work 
substantially all ihop restaurants are using pollable point of sale systems to capture and report a broad range of sales and product mix data 
this information is used by management to  among other things  gauge guest acceptance of menu items and the success of promotions and limited time offers 
over the years  we have adjusted where and when our advertisements are run to maximize the impact of our advertising dollars 
these decisions are based on market conditions for advertising and an understanding of how best to reach our target customers 
our focus remains national advertising as we believe this is the best way to drive traffic to our restaurants 
gaining the attention of consumers in a highly competitive market requires that we constantly update and modify our advertising campaigns to maintain guest engagement 
recently  we launched a campaign with the everything you love about breakfast as the tagline and theme  accompanied by a brandthem which extols the customer satisfaction gained from dining at ihop 
finally  we have increased our efforts in key social media outlets  reflecting the growing importance of these channels 
in  we re launched ihop 
com improving its interactivity and connections with key social media sites 
our e club  launched in  continues to grow and provide a valuable direct communication channel to a key group of ihop consumers 
improve operations performance we constantly strive to improve every aspect of restaurant operations 
to enhance our guest centric culture  and enable our franchisees to assess and improve their service and the condition of their restaurants  we have developed several new tools that augment our guest feedback tool  the voice of the guest program  which provides real time consumer responses to the operators and the brand 
in  we implemented an enhanced operations evaluations process whereby all ihop locations are assessed three times per year on a wide range of operational attributes  allowing franchisees to understand their performance against a set of predetermined standards 
specific training is offered to franchisees to assist them in remediating any areas of opportunity identified in the operations evaluation 
in addition  ihop modified its service procedures in to improve speed of service and improve guest satisfaction 
while results from both programs have been positive  we recognize that operations excellence is a continuous process without end 
optimize franchise development and franchise system health under the current business model  ihop seeks to optimize franchise development by recruiting franchise developers within and outside the current system and working with these franchise developers in the site selection and building process 
this strategy has proved successful as our franchisees have developed approximately restaurants since the inception of the current business model and our franchisees have a pipeline of additional new restaurants committed  optioned or pending 
in  an ihop franchisee opened the first ihop restaurants in the middle east demonstrating the interest in the ihop brand outside of north america 
in  a new international franchisee opened the first ihop restaurant in the philippines 
we continue to explore opportunities in new international markets 
the existing franchisee base accounts for most of these future development obligations 
in addition  we may take steps to consolidate and rehabilitate existing markets if we believe that doing so is advisable in order to fully realize development potential 
we consistently monitor individual franchisee health and compliance with franchise agreements and we may also take steps to exercise our contractual rights within the franchise agreement in the event of noncompliance 
in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive family dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results within the time frame anticipated 
significant known events  trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results current economic conditions the consumer continues to receive a mixture of positive and negative economic information 
gross domestic product gdp grew at a modest pace for the full year of  but preliminary estimates for the fourth quarter of showed a slight decline 
the unemployment rate declined from december to december  but the unemployment rate rose in january we believe uncertainty over the degree and duration of the economic recovery  the impact of the expiration of the payroll tax cut that had been in place for the last two years and possible deficit reduction measures may continue to temper consumer discretionary spending 
a decline or lack of growth in disposable income for discretionary spending could cause our customers to change purchasing behavior and choose lower cost dining options or alternatives to dining out 
these factors could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales trends domestic system wide same restaurant sales increase decrease q q q q q q q q q q q q applebee s quarter ytd ihop quarter ytd applebee s domestic system wide same restaurant sales increased for the year ended december  this marked the third consecutive year of same restaurant sales growth  with increases in nine of the last ten consecutive quarters 
the increase in same restaurant sales during was driven by an increase in average guest check offset by a decline in guest traffic 
the higher average guest check came from an increase in menu pricing and an increase from favorable product mix changes 
ihop s domestic system wide same restaurant sales decreased for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decline in guest traffic  partially offset by a higher average guest check compared to fiscal the decline in ihop domestic system wide same restaurant sales in reflects  in part  that the initiatives we are undertaking to improve our sales performance were not fully implemented for all of we expect that it will take several visitation and product promotion cycles for consumers to see  experience and taste the actions we have taken 
capital allocation strategy on february   our board of directors approved a capital allocation strategy that contemplates the return of a significant portion of our free cash flow to our stockholders 
the board of directors approved the payment of a cash dividend of per share of our common stock  payable at the close of business on march  to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march  the board of directors also approved a stock repurchase authorization of up to million of our common stock  replacing the previously announced million authorization  pursuant to which million of common stock was repurchased 
debt modification and retirements on february   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement 
the amendment lowers the interest rate floor on our term loan borrowings under the credit agreement by  eliminates the interest rate floor on our revolving loans under the credit agreement  reduces the amount of required debt repayments from our excess cash flow and modifies the calculation of the permitted amount of restricted payments see liquidity and capital resources of the company february amendment 
we will recognize costs of approximately million in our consolidated statements of operations related to this debt modification 
during the year ended december   we repaid million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and we repurchased million of our senior notes 
including the write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired and a million premium paid on the senior notes  we recognized a loss on the retirement of debt of million 
additionally  as the result of refranchising applebee s company operated restaurants  we were released from financing obligations of million related to of the properties refranchised 
financial statement effect of refranchising company operated restaurants as noted under highlights above  we have reached our goal of transitioning applebee to a franchised system 
compared to amounts that have been reported historically since the applebee acquisition  the amounts reported in future periods for company operated restaurant revenues and expenses will be considerably smaller  while franchise royalty revenues and expenses should increase 
our segment profit margin percentage will increase but total segment profit will likely be smaller because royalties from franchised restaurants are a smaller percentage of restaurant revenues than the historic restaurant operating profit margin percentage of company operated restaurants 
however  changes in same restaurant sales will create less of an impact on operating income now that the applebee system is franchised 
additionally  our interest expense will be lower because the after tax proceeds from the sale of restaurant assets were used to retire debt 
the completed refranchising of the applebee s company operated restaurants also will result in a reduction of both general and administrative expenses and required capital investment in restaurant assets as compared to amounts reported prior to the completion of our refranchising strategy 
significant gains and charges there were several significant gains and charges that affect the comparisons of fiscal year results with the previous periods presented herein  as shown in the following table year ended december  in millions impairment and closure charges loss on extinguishment of debt and temporary equity gain on disposition of assets each transaction is discussed in further detail as to the activity that occurred in each year under paragraphs captioned with these descriptions elsewhere in item our long lived tangible and intangible assets including goodwill must be assessed continually for indicators of impairment 
goodwill and intangible assets comprised of our total assets as of december  while there have been no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets over the past three years  given the uncertainty as to future economic and other assumptions used in assessing impairments  it is possible that significant impairment charges may occur in future periods 
we incurred significant charges in connection with the refinancing of debt in october while we have retired more than million in debt each year subsequent to that refinancing  the loss on debt extinguishment has been substantially smaller than the amount recorded in this decrease is because discount and deferred issuance costs associated with our refinanced debt that are written off on a pro rata basis as debt is retired are substantially less than those associated with our debt instruments that were extinguished in the refinancing 
therefore  while we may continue to dedicate a portion of excess cash flow towards early debt retirement  we do not anticipate recognizing significant losses on the extinguishment of debt unless we enter into another refinancing transaction that extinguishes all then current debt 
gains on disposition of assets relate primarily to the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of applebee s company operated restaurants 
since we have achieved our goal of becoming franchised  we do not anticipate significant gains or losses on the disposition of assets in the future 
restaurant data the following table sets forth  for each of the past three years  the number of effective restaurants in the applebee and ihop systems and information regarding the percentage change in sales at those restaurants compared to the same period in the prior year 
effective restaurants are the number of restaurants in a given period  adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period 
information is presented for all effective restaurants in the applebee and ihop systems  which includes company operated restaurants  as well as those operated by franchisees and area licensees 
sales of restaurants that are operated by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the company 
however  we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales  as well as  in some cases  rental payments under leases that are usually based on a percentage of their sales 
management also uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants as well as evaluation of current operations

recoverability of a restaurant assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful lives or remaining lease terms  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  this may be an indicator of impairment 
if it is decided that there has been an impairment  the carrying amount of the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
the fair value is primarily determined by discounting the future cash flows based on our cost of capital 
impairment charges for the year ended december  primarily related to equipment at five ihop franchise restaurants whose lease agreements were prematurely terminated and the restaurants subsequently refranchised

the restaurant refranchising and closures noted above had a net favorable impact of on restaurant operating profit margin  primarily because the markets refranchised had higher than average labor costs 
in terms of specific cost categories at currently operating company restaurants food and beverage costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased  primarily due to a increase in overall commodity costs primarily produce  poultry  seafood and dairy as well as menu changes  partially offset by improvement in waste variances and savings associated with distribution center realignment 
labor costs as a percentage of restaurant sales increased due to higher payroll related costs  increased management staffing levels and salaries  partially offset by decreased use of hourly shift supervisors and lower bonus costs 
payroll related costs increased because of the expiration of hire act fica credits along with higher costs of workers compensation insurance and hourly vacation expense

as noted above  restaurants that previously had been operated by a former franchisee that defaulted on its obligations under the franchise agreements were refranchised to an affiliate of an existing ihop franchisee in the first quarter of the equipment related to those restaurants was sold to the new operator and as a result  segment revenues and expenses for increased million and million  respectively  compared to the same period of the increase in revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in interest revenue primarily due to the progressive decline in note balances due to repayments and a decline in refranchising activity other than that related to the defaulted franchisee 
the increase in expense because of the equipment sale was partially offset by a decline in refranchising activity other than that related to the defaulted franchisee

stock based compensation costs decreased primarily because expenses in related to the acceleration of equity grants due to the retirement of an executive and changes related to vesting of certain equity grants to directors that did not recur and the impact of a lower stock price as of december  on equity grants accounted for as liabilities 
the increase in salaries and benefits and recruiting and relocation expenses was primarily due to the hiring of more executive level positions in and the latter part of interest expense the million decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower non cash interest charges in compared to and a reduction in long term debt over the past twelve months  partially offset by an increase in overall weighted interest rates 
non cash interest charges declined to million in from million because deferred financing costs and discounts associated with our debt instruments that were refinanced in october were written off at that time and the deferred financing costs and discounts associated with new debt instruments are substantially less than those related to the refinanced debt

impairment and closure charges impairment and closure charges for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  in millions long lived tangible asset impairment lenexa lease termination closure charges total impairment and closure charges on a quarterly basis  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of tangible long lived assets  primarily assets related to company operated restaurants  may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a restaurant assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful lives or remaining lease terms  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  this may be an indicator of impairment 
if it is decided that there has been an impairment  the carrying amount of the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
the fair value is primarily determined by discounting the future cash flows based on our cost of capital 
impairment and closure charges for the year ended december  were primarily comprised of million related to termination of our sublease of the commercial space occupied by applebee s restaurant support center in lenexa  kansas through october  and a million impairment charge related to the furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements at that facility 
other closure charges primarily related to adjustments to the reserve for previously closed surplus ihop properties 
for the year ended december   we recognized impairment charges of million and closure charges of million 
the impairment charges primarily related to properties associated with applebee company operated restaurants in the minnesota market expected to be sold and to a single applebee restaurant and the land on which it is situated 
the closure charges related primarily to two company operated ihop cafe restaurants  a non traditional restaurant test format that was evaluated but will no longer be utilized  and to the closure of the only company operated applebee restaurant in china

income tax provision benefit we recorded a tax provision of million in as compared to a recognized tax benefit of million in the change was primarily due to the increase in our pretax book income

liquidity and capital resources of the company credit facilities in october  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders and financial institutions the credit agreement that established a senior secured credit facility the credit facility consisting of a million term facility the term facility maturing in october and a million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving facility maturing in october the credit agreement also provides for an uncommitted incremental facility that permits us  subject to certain conditions  to increase the credit facility by up to million  provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments under the revolving facility may not exceed million

pursuant to amendment no 
 the interest rate margin applicable to libor based term loans was reduced from to  and the interest rate floors used to determine the libor and base rate reference rates for term loans were reduced from to for libor based loans and from to for base rate denominated loans 
given the relative stability of libor rates since february and the amended rate floors  amendment no 
effectively lowered our interest rate on libor based term loans from to  the rate in effect for all of taking into account fees and expenses associated with the credit agreement and amendment no 
that are amortized as additional non cash interest expense over a seven year period  the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december  was 
amendment no 
did not change the interest rates on revolving loans  but it did increase the available lender commitments under the revolving facility from million to million 
the revolving facility is utilized  among other purposes  to collateralize certain letters of credit we are required to maintain 
such collateralization does not constitute a draw down under the revolving facility but does reduce the amount that can be borrowed under the revolving facility 
unused amounts of the revolving facility bear interest at the rate of basis points per annum 
concurrent with amendment no

also revised the definition of permitted amount so that it is now measured on a quarterly basis for purposes of computing the permitted amount of restricted payments  which includes payment of dividends on and repurchases of our common stock 
finally  amendment no 
revised the definition of excess cash flow to eliminate the deduction for any extraordinary receipts or disposition proceeds 
all of these provisions will be retroactively applied to the calculation of excess cash flow for fiscal all other material provisions  including maturity and covenants under the credit agreement  remain unchanged

as a result of applying the revision of the definition of excess cash flow retroactively as provided for in amendment no 
 there were no mandatory repayments of term loans required in and our permitted amount of restricted payments is approximately million as of december  based on our current level of operations  we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during we have not entered into hedging agreements to mitigate the effect of changes in variable interest rates charged on borrowings under the credit agreement 
senior notes due in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due october  the senior notes pursuant to an indenture the indenture by and among the company  the guarantors party thereto and wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
the senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the guarantors under the credit agreement 
there are no mandatory repayments of the senior notes  although under certain conditions we may be required to repurchase senior notes with excess proceeds of assets sales or upon a change of control  as described in the indenture under which the senior notes were issued 
there were no such required repurchases during debt covenants pursuant to the credit agreement  we are required to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated cash interest coverage ratio 
the company current required maximum consolidated leverage ratio of total debt net of unrestricted cash not to exceed million to adjusted ebitda is our current required minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to consolidated cash interest is compliance with each of these ratios is required quarterly  on a trailing four quarter basis 
these ratio thresholds become more rigorous over time

the senior notes  the term facility and the revolving facility are also subject to affirmative and negative covenants considered customary for similar types of facilities  including  but not limited to  covenants with respect to incremental indebtedness  liens  investments  affiliate transactions  and capital expenditures 
these covenants are subject to a number of important limitations  qualifications and exceptions 
certain of these covenants will not be applicable to the senior notes during any time that the senior notes maintain investment grade ratings

franchising of applebee company operated restaurants in october  we achieved our stated goal of transitioning applebee to a franchised system  similar to ihop franchised system 
we believe a highly franchised business model requires less capital investment and general and administrative overhead  generates higher gross and operating profit margins as a percentage of revenue and reduces the volatility of free cash flow performance  as compared to a model based on operating a significant number of company restaurants 
during  we completed the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of applebee company operated restaurants 
proceeds from asset dispositions  including the restaurants  totaled million for the year ended december   the majority of which was used to retire debt  after payment of income taxes related to the transactions 
with the completion of our strategy to refranchise and sell the related restaurant assets of applebee company operated restaurants  we do not anticipate significant proceeds from asset dispositions in the foreseeable future 
cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by revenues earned and collected from our franchisees  operating earnings from our company operated restaurants and profit from our rental operations and financing operations 
franchise revenues consist of royalties  ihop advertising fees and sales of proprietary products for ihop  each of which fluctuates with increases or decreases in franchise retail sales 
franchise retail sales are impacted by the development of ihop and applebee restaurants by our franchisees and by fluctuations in same restaurant sales 
operating earnings from company operated restaurants are impacted by many factors which include but are not limited to changes in traffic patterns  pricing activities and changes in operating expenses 
rental operations profit is rental income less rental expenses 
rental income includes revenues from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases 
rental income is impacted by fluctuations in same restaurant sales as some operating leases include a provision for contingent rent based on retail sales and a progressive decline in rental income as leases expire 
rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on franchisee operated restaurants 
financing operations revenue consists of interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases as well as periodic sales of equipment 
financing income is impacted by a progressive decline in interest revenue as the obligations financed are repaid 
financing expenses are primarily the cost of restaurant equipment 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million during the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in  a decrease of million 
the primary reasons for this unfavorable change were an increase of million in income taxes paid in cash  and a million decrease in segment profit  excluding depreciation and other non cash changes  partially offset by a decrease of million in cash interest payments 
the increase in income taxes paid was primarily due to gains on the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of applebee company operated restaurants  as well as a tax refund of million received in that did not recur in proceeds from asset sales are an investing cash inflow while all income taxes paid are an operating cash outflow 
the lower segment profit was due  in large part  to the refranchising of applebee company operated restaurants over the past two years 
cash interest expense was lower due to the retirement of debt 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily attributable to million of proceeds from dispositions of assets  primarily the refranchising of applebee company operated restaurants  and million of principal receipts from notes  equipment contracts and other long term receivables  partially offset by million of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures decreased from million in due primarily to a decline in the number of company operated restaurants 
we expect capital expenditures to range between approximately million and million in fiscal  also because of the decline in the number of company operated restaurants 
the following table represents the principal receipts on various long term receivables due from our franchisees as of december  principal receipts due by period thereafter total in millions equipment leases direct financing leases franchise notes and other total equipment lease receivables extend through the year direct financing lease receivables extend through the year franchise note receivables extend through the year financing activities financing activities used net cash of million during cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of million in repayments of long term debt  partially offset by a net financing cash inflow of million from equity based compensation transactions 
of the long term debt repayments  million related to term loans  million related to senior notes including million of premiums and million was scheduled repayments of capital leases and financing obligations 
during  we borrowed and repaid million under our revolving facility 
free cash flow we define free cash flow for a given period as cash provided by operating activities  plus receipts from notes  equipment contracts and other long term receivables long term receivables  less dividends paid and capital expenditures 
we believe this information is helpful to investors to determine our cash available for general corporate and strategic purposes  including the implementation of our capital allocation strategy 
free cash flow is considered to be a non us gaap measure 
reconciliation of the cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is as follows year ended december  in millions cash flows provided by operating activities principal receipts from notes  equipment contracts and other long term receivables dividends paid additions to property and equipment free cash flow this non us gaap measure is not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
non us gaap measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  the us gaap information contained within our financial statements 
free cash flow totaled million during the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in  a decline of million 
this decline was due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed above  partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures 
dividends we did not pay dividends on our common stock in as discussed in restricted payments above  payment of dividends is subject to limitations under our credit agreement 
we evaluate dividend payments on common stock within the context of our overall capital allocation strategy with our board of directors on an ongoing basis  giving consideration to our current and forecast earnings  financial condition  cash requirements  limitations under the credit agreement and other factors 
on february   our board of directors approved payment of a cash dividend of per share of the our common stock  payable at the close of business on march  to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march  share repurchases as discussed in restricted payments above  repurchases of common stock are subject to limitations under our credit agreement 
we evaluate repurchases of common stock within the context of our overall capital allocation strategy with our board of directors on an ongoing basis  giving consideration to our current and forecast earnings  financial condition  cash requirements  limitations under the credit agreement and other factors 
in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase up to million of dineequity common stock 
repurchases are subject to prevailing market prices and may take place in open market transactions and in privately negotiated transactions  based on business  market  applicable legal requirements and other considerations 
the program does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares and may be terminated at any time 
there were no repurchases of our common stock during as of december   we have repurchased  shares under this program at an average price of per share 
on february   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase authorization of up to million of our common stock  replacing the previously announced million stock repurchase authorization 
we may now repurchase up to an additional million of our common stock under the revised authorization 
we do  from time to time  repurchase shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock awards 
such shares are purchased at the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a of sec regulation s k 
contractual obligations and commitments the following are our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations year years years more than years total in millions debt operating leases capital leases financing obligations purchase commitments unrecognized income tax benefits total minimum payments less interest total expiration by period commitments year years years more than years total in millions lease guarantees letters of credit food purchases total includes interest calculated on balances as of december  using interest rates in effect as of december  while up to million is expected to be paid within one year  there is no contractual obligation to do so 
for the remaining liability  due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when a cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
this amount represents the maximum potential liability for future payment guarantees under leases that have been assigned to third party buyers of applebee company operated restaurants and expire at the end of the respective lease terms  which range from through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
primarily to satisfy insurance related collateral requirements 
these letters of credit expire annually  but are typically renewed in the same amount each year unless collateral requirements change 
in some instances  ihop and applebee may be required to guarantee their purchase of any remaining inventory of certain food and other items purchased on their behalf for the purpose of supplying limited time promotions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangibles goodwill is recorded when the aggregate purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and are estimated by management based on the fair value of the assets received 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised primarily of trademarks  tradenames and franchise agreements 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives franchise agreements  recipes  menus and favorable leaseholds are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives 
goodwill and intangible assets considered to have an indefinite life primarily tradename and liquor licenses are not subject to amortization 
the determination of indefinite life is subject to reassessment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate the period of benefit has become finite 
goodwill has been allocated to three reporting units  the applebee company operated restaurants unit applebee company unit  the applebee franchised restaurants unit applebee franchise unit and the ihop franchised restaurants unit ihop franchise unit  in accordance with us gaap 
the significant majority of our goodwill resulted from the november  acquisition of applebee and was allocated between the two applebee units 
the goodwill allocated to the applebee company unit was fully impaired in we have elected to bypass the option allowed under us gaap to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment 
we perform a quantitative test for impairment on an annual basis 
the impairment test of goodwill of the applebee franchise unit and the tradename of the applebee company and franchise units is performed as of october of each year 
the impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop franchise unit is performed as of december of each year 
in addition to the annual test of impairment  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments or a significant decline in the market price of our common stock 
in the process of our annual impairment review of goodwill  we primarily use the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the discounted cash flows model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures and changes in working capital  along with an appropriate discount rate based on our estimated cost of equity capital and after tax cost of debt 
the first step of the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to their carrying value 
if the fair value is in excess of the carrying value  no impairment exists 
if the first step does indicate an impairment  a second step must take place 
under the second step  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill  to which the carrying value of the goodwill must be adjusted 
the fair value of all reporting units is then compared to the current market value of our common stock to determine if the fair values estimated in the impairment testing process are reasonable in light of the current market value 
in the process of our annual impairment review of the tradename  the most significant indefinite life intangible asset  we primarily use the relief of royalty method under income approach method of valuation 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales  a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream 
long lived assets we assess long lived and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
we consider factors such as the number of years the restaurant has been operated by us  sales trends  cash flow trends  remaining lease life  and other factors which apply on a case by case basis 
the analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment 
recoverability of the restaurant assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful life or remaining lease term  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  the carrying amount is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss resulting from impairment is recognized by a charge to earnings 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
revenue recognition we record revenue in four categories franchise operations  company restaurant operations  rental operations and financing operations 
the franchise operations revenue consists primarily of royalty revenues  sales of proprietary ihop products  ihop advertising fees and the portion of the franchise fees allocated to our intellectual property 
company restaurant sales are retail sales at company operated restaurants 
rental operations revenue includes revenue from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases 
financing operations revenue consists of interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases  as well as sales of equipment associated with refranchised ihop restaurants and a portion of franchise fees for restaurants taken back from franchisees not allocated to ihop intellectual property 
revenues from franchised and area licensed restaurants include royalties  continuing rent and service fees and initial franchise fees 
royalties are recognized in the period in which the sales are reported to have occurred 
continuing rent and fees are recognized in the period earned 
initial franchise fees are recognized upon the opening of a restaurant  which is when we have performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
fees from development agreements are deferred and recorded into income as restaurants under the development agreement are opened 
sales by company operated restaurants are recognized when food and beverage items are sold 
company restaurant sales are reported net of sales taxes collected from guests that are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities 
we record a liability in the period in which a gift card is sold 
as gift cards are redeemed  this liability is reduced  with revenue recognized on redemptions at company operated restaurants 
we recognize gift card breakage income on gift cards issued by applebee when the assessment of the likelihood of redemption of the gift card becomes remote 
this assessment is based upon applebee historical experience with gift card redemptions 
we currently do not record breakage income on gift cards issued by ihop due to the limited historical experience with ihop gift card redemptions because the ihop gift card program has not been in existence as long as the applebee program 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing receivables  however  changes in circumstances relating to receivables may result in additional allowances in the future 
we determine the allowance based on historical experience  current payment patterns  future obligations and our assessment of the ability to pay outstanding balances 
the primary indicator of credit quality is delinquency  which is considered to be a receivable balance greater than days past due 
we continually review our allowance for doubtful accounts 
past due balances and future obligations are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
leases our restaurants are located on i sites owned by us  ii sites leased by us from third parties and iii sites owned or leased by franchisees 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease in accordance with the provisions of us gaap governing the accounting for leases 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
prior to january   we capitalized rent expense from possession date through construction completion and reported the related asset in property and equipment 
capitalized rent was amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease term 
straight line rent recorded during the preopening period construction completion through restaurant open date was recorded as expense 
commencing january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeds the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
we use a consistent lease term when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements  when determining straight line rent expense and when determining classification of our leases as either operating or capital 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant openings will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rent paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
certain of our lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances 
for purposes of recognizing incentives  we amortize the incentives over the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term 
for tenant improvement allowances  we also record a deferred rent liability or an obligation in our non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with us gaap governing share based payments 
accordingly  we measure stock based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense over the employee requisite service period using the straight line method 
the fair value of each employee stock option and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based compensation 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of us gaap 
the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
these inputs are subjective and are determined using management judgment 
if differences arise between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future stock based compensation expense 
any such changes could materially impact our operations in the period in which the changes are made and in subsequent periods 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities 
we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayers and respective governmental authorities 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
us gaap addressing the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized or derecognized in the financial statement when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
recently adopted accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
the amendments in asu result in common fair value measurement and 
table of contents disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
asu also provides for certain changes in current gaap disclosure requirements 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu requires the presentation of the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments in this update did not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment asu 
the amendments in asu no 
are intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by adding a qualitative review step to assess whether the required quantitative impairment analysis that exists today is necessary 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
we adopted asu as of january   but did not elect to utilize the option of qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles testing indefinite lived intangibles for impairment asu 
asu allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test on indefinite lived intangibles 
an entity electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the entity determines  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the guidance is effective for impairment tests for our fiscal  however  earlier adoption is allowed 
as the guidance does not change the underlying principle that the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset should not exceed its fair value  the adoption of asu is not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we reviewed all other newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they either are not applicable to our operations or that no material effect is expected on our financial statements as a result of future adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk  including interest rates and commodity prices 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that may include the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest expense and income is sensitive to fluctuations in the london inter bank offered rate libor and the general level of united states interest rates 
changes in libor can affect the interest expense on our senior secured credit facility while changes in the united states treasury based interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments 
our future investment income and interest expense may differ from expectations due to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt the term loan under our credit agreement 
if the interest rate on the term loan were to increase by per annum  annual interest expense would increase by approximately million based on the outstanding term loan balance at december  a decrease in interest rates from december  rates would have no impact on interest expense as the current interest rate is at the floor rate as defined in the credit agreement 
investments in instruments earning a fixed rate of interest carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
we currently do not hold any fixed rate investments 
as of december   our long term investments are comprised primarily of certificates of deposits  mutual funds invested in auction rate securities and one auction rate security  these investments are included in restricted assets related to the captive insurance subsidiary 
we have classified these investments as available for sale 
due to the short time period between reset dates of the interest rates  there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with the interest rate related to the auction rate securities 
the one auction rate security has a contractual maturity of december based on our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term restricted investment holdings as of  a increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest income by approximately million 
a decline in interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by less than million as the majority of our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term investment holdings are currently yielding less than 
commodity prices many of the food products purchased by us and our franchisees and area licensees are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to unpredictable price volatility 
extreme increases in commodity prices and or long term changes could affect our franchisees  area licensees and company operated restaurants adversely 
the risk with respect to company operated restaurants has lessened now that both of our brands are franchised 
we expect that  in most cases  the ihop and applebee systems would be able to pass increased commodity prices through to our consumers via increases in menu prices 
from time to time  competitive circumstances could limit short term menu price flexibility  and in those cases  margins would be negatively impacted by increased commodity prices 
we believe that any changes in commodity pricing that cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other strategies would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the company and owners of applebee and ihop franchise restaurants formed cscs to manage procurement activities for the applebee and ihop restaurants choosing to join the co op 
we believe the larger scale created by combining the supply chain requirements of both brands under one organization can provide cost savings and efficiency in the purchasing function 
as of december   of applebee franchise restaurants and of ihop franchise restaurants are members of cscs 
in some instances  ihop and applebee may be required to guarantee their purchase of any remaining inventory of certain food and other items purchased by cscs for the purpose of supplying limited time promotions on behalf of the ihop applebee and ihop systems as a whole 
none of these food product guarantees is a derivative instrument 
at december   our outstanding guarantees for food product purchases were million
