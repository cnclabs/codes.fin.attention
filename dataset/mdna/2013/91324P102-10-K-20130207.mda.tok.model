a description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this item and in item a  risk factors 
executive overview general unitedhealth group is a diversified health and well being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making health care work better 
we offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms unitedhealthcare  which provides health care coverage and benefits services  and optum  which provides information and technology enabled health services 
further information on our business is included in item  business and additional information on the our segments can be found in this item and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item  financial statements 
revenues our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one year period  and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs 
we also generate revenues from fee based services performed for customers that self insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants 
for both risk based and fee based health care benefit arrangements  we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services  transaction processing  health care professional services  and access to contracted networks of physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals 
we also generate service revenues from our optum businesses relating to care management  consumer engagement and support  distribution of benefits and services  health financial services  operational services and support  health care information technology and pharmacy services 
product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business 
we derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities  investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold  or other than temporarily impaired 
pricing trends 
we seek to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends  while balancing growth  margins  competitive dynamics  cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of health reform legislation and premium rebates at the local market level 
we endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business 
changes in business mix and health reform legislation may impact our premiums  medical costs and medical care ratio 
further  we continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure through continued market competition in commercial products and government payment rates 
aggregating unitedhealthcare s businesses  we expect the medical care ratio to rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the health benefit exchange market in in the commercial market segment  we expect pricing to continue to be highly competitive in we plan to hold to our pricing disciplines and  considering the competitive environment and persistently weak employment and new business formation rates  we expect continued pressure on our commercial risk based product membership in additionally  self insured membership as a percent of total commercial membership is expected to continue to increase at a modest pace in and beyond  due in part to the emerging popularity of midsize employers moving to self funded arrangements 
in government programs  we are seeing continuing rate pressures  and rate changes for some medicaid programs are slightly negative 
unlike in prior years  recent medicaid reductions have generally not been mitigated by corresponding benefit reductions or care provider fee schedule reductions by the state sponsor 
we continue to take a prudent  market sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing medicaid contracts 
medicare funding is similarly pressured  see further discussion below in regulatory trends and uncertainties 
we expect these factors to result in pressure on gross margin percentages for our medicare and medicaid programs in in  unitedhealthcare created a new affordable basic plan for medicare part d consumers and reclassified its large million member medicare part d plan to an enhanced plan status with cms 
the change to enhanced plan status changes the seasonal pattern of earnings to later in the year with no material impact expected on full year profitability 

table of contents operating costs medical costs 
medical costs represent the costs of our obligations for claims and or benefits of our risk based insurance arrangements 
our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate  price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria  product design  negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs 
controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients consumers  health professionals  hospitals  pharmaceutical technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders 
medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims  and our estimates for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
our medical care ratio  calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues  reflects the combination of pricing  rebates  benefit designs  consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts 
medical cost trends 
in  we managed our commercial medical cost trend to a level under percent 
in  we expect a slight increase in trend from  albeit with relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to we expect our total trend will be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers as they try to compensate for soft utilization trends and cross subsidization pressure due to their government reimbursement levels 
underlying utilization trends declined significantly in and increased modestly in and use of outpatient services has been the primary driver of utilization trend increase  with inpatient utilization declining 
we also experienced an increase in prescription drug costs in and expect that trend to continue due to unit cost pressure and a trend towards expensive new specialty drugs 
as we move into  we believe current utilization trends are slightly below what we believe to be normal utilization levels 
the weak economic environment  combined with our medical cost management  has had a favorable impact on utilization trends 
we believe our alignment of progressive benefit designs  consumer engagement  clinical management  pay for performance reimbursement programs for care providers and network resources is favorably controlling medical and pharmacy costs  enhancing affordability and quality for our customers and members and helping to drive strong market response and growth 
operating costs 
operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits  agent and broker commissions  premium taxes and assessments  professional fees  advertising and occupancy costs 
we seek to improve our operating cost ratio  calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues  for an equivalent mix of business 
however  changes in business mix  such as increases in the size of our health services businesses or an increase in the delivery of medical services on an integrated basis may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio 
other business trends our businesses participate in the us  brazilian and certain other health economies 
in the us  health care spending comprises approximately of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years 
we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future  due to inflation  medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement  regulatory requirements  demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well being 
the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors  including macro economic conditions and regulatory changes  including in the us enacted health care reforms  which could also impact our results of operations 
delivery system and payment modernization 
the market is changing based on demographic shifts  new regulations  political forces and both payer and patient expectations 
these factors are creating market pressures to change from fee for service models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer  integrated care across care providers and pay for performance payment structures 
health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve the overall care for people  improve the health of a population and reduce the cost of care 
the focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme 
we have seen increased participation in incentive based payment models such as pay for performance  shared savings  bundled episode payment and patient centered medical home models pcmhs 
we also have seen continued development and deployment of risk based accountable care models designed to modernize local delivery systems by better coordinating care  reducing the fragmentation of treatments between multiple care providers in the current system  limiting unnecessary hospital admissions and readmissions  focusing on preventive care  breaking down reimbursement and treatment silos  and improving quality and outcomes 

table of contents this trend is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems  providing growth opportunities for our optum business platform 
government reliance on private sector 
the government  as a benefit sponsor  has been increasingly relying on private sector solutions 
we expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible  better managed  higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs 
states are struggling to balance unprecedented budget pressures with increases in their medicaid expenditures 
at the same time  many are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs 
more and more  medicaid managed care is being viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs 
additionally  there are more than nine million individuals eligible for both medicare and medicaid 
dually eligible beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than a typical medicare or medicaid beneficiary 
while these individuals health needs are more complex and more costly  they have historically been in unmanaged environments 
this provides unitedhealthcare an opportunity to integrate medicare and medicaid financing to fund efforts to optimize the health status of this frail population through close coordination of care 
as of december   unitedhealthcare served more than  members in legacy dually eligible programs through medicare advantage and snps 
in  unitedhealthcare community state will help implement ohio s mme program  one of the first in the country under the new cms design 
regulatory trends and uncertainties following is a summary of management s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the health reform legislation and other regulatory items  for additional information regarding the health reform legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties  see item  business government regulation and item a  risk factors 
commercial rate increase review 
the health reform legislation requires hhs to maintain an annual review of unreasonable increases in premium rates for commercial health plans 
hhs established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above and clarified that hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval procedures 
premium rate review legislation ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states as of the date of this report 
the competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a tight  competitive commercial pricing environment 
further  our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practices 
we anticipate requesting rate increases above in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform 
we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states  including california and new york 
depending on the level of scrutiny by the states  there is a broad range of potential business impacts 
for example  it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends  leading to the risk of operating margin compression in the commercial health benefits business 
medicare advantage rates and minimum loss ratios 
medicare advantage pricing benchmarks have been cut over the last several years and additional cuts were implemented in  with changes to continue to be phased in over the next one to five years benchmarks will ultimately range from of medicare fee for service rates in high cost areas to in low cost areas  depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county 
additionally  congress passed the budget control act of  which as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of  would trigger automatic across the board budget cuts sequestration  including a reduction in outlays for medicare starting in march  absent further congressional action 
further  beginning in  medicare advantage plans will be required to have a minimum medical loss ratio of 
cms has not yet issued guidance as to how this requirement will be calculated for medicare advantage plans 
a significant portion of our network contracts are tied to medicare reimbursement levels 
however  future medicare advantage rates may be outpaced by underlying medical cost trends  placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs 
there are a number of annual adjustments we can and are making to our operations  which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions 
for example  we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management  adjust members benefits and decide on a county by county basis in which geographies to participate 
additionally  achieving high quality scores from cms for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions 
the expanded stars bonus program is set to expire in in  quality bonus payments will only be paid to and star plans per ppaca compared to current bonuses that are available to certain qualifying plans rated stars or higher 
approximately and of our current medicare advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated stars or higher and stars or 
table of contents higher  respectively for the payment year based on scoring released by cms in october updated scores  to be released in october  will determine what portion of our medicare advantage membership will reside in a star or star plan and qualify for quality bonus payments in although we are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings  if we are unable to significantly increase the level of membership in plans with a rating of stars or higher for the payment year  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
we also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due  in part  to the increasing number of people eligible for medicare in coming years 
compared to  our medicare advantage membership has increased by  consumers  or  including acquisitions 
longer term  market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of medicare advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our medicare supplement and medicare part d insurance offerings 
industry fees and taxes 
the health reform legislation includes an annual  non deductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk based products  beginning january  the amount of the annual tax is billion in  billion in and  billion in and billion in for and beyond  the amount will be equal to the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year 
the annual tax will be allocated based on the ratio of an entity s net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industry s net premiums written for any us health risk based products during the preceding calendar year  subject to certain exceptions 
this tax will first be paid and expensed in  however  because our policies are annual  we have included the tax and other health reform legislation cost factors in our rate filings relating to rate periods and any related premium increases for policies that have coverage into will increase the amount of premium recognized in our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in as a result of the non deductibility of these taxes 
with the introduction of state health insurance exchanges in  the health reform legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets 
these programs are a transitional reinsurance program  a temporary risk corridors program  and a permanent risk adjustment program 
the transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program which will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self funded arrangements billion over a three year period beginning in of which billion subject to increases based on state decisions will fund the state reinsurance pools and billion funds the us treasury 
the terms of the specific reinsurance programs to be used in each state are not yet known 
it is our intention to pass these taxes and fees on to customers through increases in rates and or decreases in benefits  subject to regulatory approval 
state based exchanges and coverage expansion 
effective in  state based exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers with enrollment processes scheduled to commence in october of we expect to selectively respond and participate in exchanges as they are introduced to the market 
our level of participation in state based exchanges will be driven by how we assess each local market s current and future prospects  including how the exchange and its rules are set up state by state and  our market position relative to others in the market 
our participation will likely evolve and change over time as the exchange markets mature 
exchanges will create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses  depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market  its pace and its impact on our established membership 
for example  certain small employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and larger employers may elect to convert their benefit plans from risk based to self funded programs 
the health reform legislation also provides for expanded medicaid coverage effective in january these measures remain subject to implementation at the state level 
individual small group market reforms 
the health reform legislation includes several provisions that will take effect on january  and are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace 
although hhs issued proposed regulations in late  these regulations are not yet final 
key provisions include adjusted community rating requirements  which will change how individual and small group plans are rated in many states and are expected to result in significant adjustments in some policyholders rates during the transition period  essential health benefit requirements  which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders and will also impact rates  and actuarial value requirements  which will significantly impact benefit designs eg member cost sharing requirements and could also significantly impact rates for some policyholders
