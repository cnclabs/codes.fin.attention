item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition we had approximately  in available cash and short term investments as of december  the table below summarizes the changes in selected  key balance sheet items in thousands  except for percentages as of december  decrease increase cash  cash equivalents and short term investments   net working capital   total assets   stockholders equity   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by  or  to  at december  from  at december  net cash provided by operating activities amounted to  during the year ended december  in contrast to net cash used for operating activities of  during the year ended december  capital investments of  during compared to capital investments of  during net working capital increased by  or  to  at december  from  at december  during we repaid  in bank debt 
proceeds from bank debt received during aggregated  net of debt repayments made during total assets increased by less than  or  to  at december  from  at december  stockholders equity increased by  or  to  at december  from  at december  we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our working capital requirements and to finance our ongoing business operations during at least the next twelve months 
immucell corporation during the third quarter of  we agreed to terms of certain credit facilities with td bank  na aggregating up to approximately  which are secured by substantially all of our assets 
these credit facilities are comprised of a  ten year mortgage loan  a  fifty four month note and a  line of credit 
proceeds from the  mortgage loan were received during the third quarter of proceeds from the  note were received during the first quarter of as of december   our outstanding bank debt balance was approximately  the  line of credit is available as needed 
we believe that this debt financing together with available cash and gross margin from ongoing product sales provides us with sufficient funding to finance our working capital requirements while completing the first submissions to the fda of all technical sections pertaining to mast out 
we chose debt financing because we believe that in this market environment  the option to generate funds through the sale of equity securities at an acceptable level of stockholder dilution is very unlikely 
since  our strategy has been focused on selling and developing products that improve animal health and productivity in the dairy and beef industries 
these product opportunities are generally less expensive to develop than the human health product opportunities that we had worked on during the s 
we funded most of our product development expenses principally from product sales and were profitable for each of the nine years in the period ended december  during this nine years of profitability  our cumulative investment in product development expenses of  was supported  in part  by  in licensing revenue  technology sales and grant income 
our strategic decision to continue developing mast out after the product rights were returned to us in caused us to increase our spending on product development expenses that were previously funded by a former partner from late to mid after these nine consecutive years of profitability  we incurred net losses of    and  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
as anticipated  a reduction in product development expenses during helped us return to profitability 
due principally to an anticipated increase in product development expenses for ongoing mast out expenses and an increased investment in other new product development expenses above the investment but still less than the expense level  we expect results to be near breakeven 
we believe that the two key indicators of our financial performance going forward will be the gross margin on our product sales and our net operating income 
the investment of an additional  in product development expenses during thru brings our cumulative investment to  during the fourteen year period ended december  we may  on occasion  seek additional research grant support as a means of leveraging the funds that we are able to spend developing new products 
we continue to look for new product acquisition opportunities that would have a strategic fit with the products that we currently sell 
a significant investment primarily related to the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api principally related to manufacturing scale up and preparations of full scale batches remains ahead to complete the mast out product development initiative 
our initial plan was to have the api produced for us under contract in order to avoid the investment in a manufacturing facility 
by the end of  we determined that the large minimum production volumes and high cost imposed by the selected contract manufacturer were not commercially sustainable 
we believe that controlling the manufacture of the api ourselves  rather than hiring a contractor  would improve our competitiveness and increase our opportunity for success 
as a result  we developed a plan to build a production facility for the api and  with assistance from prospective builders  we estimated that it would require approximately  to construct a new manufacturing facility 
because the actual cost could be higher  we have evaluated strategic alternatives to new construction 
during the fourth quarter of  we projected that we could reduce this upfront investment by leasing an existing facility rather than constructing a new one  and we engaged an engineering firm to estimate these costs 
the resulting engineering report estimated these costs to be in the range of  to  in addition to the use of some of our cash  we are seeking debt issuance  equity financing and or an investment from a partner as well as possible state and other financial incentives to support the investment required to manufacture the api 
absent such funding  we have not initiated the construction of our own api manufacturing facility or the leasing of an existing facility as of this date 
because we believe that the appropriate development and marketing partner would maximize the commercial sales potential for mast out  we continue to seek a partnership that would provide guaranteed cash and or minimum levels of funding and ongoing revenue in return for marketing rights 
the information that we have learned during negotiations with potential partners to date has increased our confidence in the likelihood of achieving fda approval and in the potential value of the market opportunity for mast out 
we believe that the evolution of our thinking relating to these strategic alternatives demonstrates the flexibility and creativity required to solve this financing challenge 
immucell corporation as part of our sustained investment in compliance with cgmp regulations across our product lines and as we make other process improvements  we are investing in personnel  equipment and facility modifications to increase the efficiency and quality of our operations 
the size of this investment in capital expenditures for facility modifications and production equipment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
as of january   we had remaining available authorization to spend up to approximately  on capital expenditures  which authorized amount is net of increases aggregating  during that were approved by our board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements none results of operations compared to product sales product sales for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  in domestic product sales increased by  or  during the year ended december   and international sales increased by  or  in comparison to for the three month period ended december   product sales increased by  or  in comparison to the three month period ended december  we believe our increased investment in sales and marketing personnel and efforts is helping us introduce first defense to new customers 
we believe that sales of our products were influenced by the relatively strong prices of milk  cows and calves which values were partially offset by the increased cost of feed 
competition for resources that dairy producers allocate to their calf enterprises has been increased by the many new products that have been introduced to the calf market 
while milk prices have improved recently  much of this gain has been offset by increases in the cost of feed 
even in this challenging market  our lead product  first defense  continues to benefit from wide acceptance by dairy and beef producers as an effective tool to prevent bovine enteritis scours in newborn calves 
it is our production and customer service objective to ship orders within one day of receipt 
we have been operating in accordance with this objective since the third quarter of sales of first defense aggregated of our total product sales during both of the years ended december  and sales of first defense increased by during the year ended december  in comparison to domestic sales of first defense increased by  and international sales increased by 
sales of first defense are normally seasonal  with higher sales expected during the first quarter 
with the single exception of the second quarter of  we have been experiencing consistently positive sales growth of first defense since the fourth quarter of  as demonstrated below fiscal year over fiscal year fourth quarter over fourth quarter third quarter over third quarter second quarter under second quarter first quarter over first quarter fiscal year over fiscal year fourth quarter over fourth quarter third quarter over third quarter second quarter over second quarter first quarter over first quarter fourth quarter over fourth quarter we believe that the growth in sales of first defense may reflect  at least in part  the success of our strategic decision first implemented in to invest in additional sales and marketing efforts 
we launched a communications campaign at the end of that is highlighting how the unique features of first defense provide a dependable return on investment for producers

sales of wipe out dairy wipes decreased by during the year ended december  in comparison to we believe that sales growth potential for wipe out dairy wipes is limited because most of our sales of this product tend to be to smaller dairies that are under continued financial pressures 
such pressures are forcing many small dairy producers out of business 
while our product is a high quality tool  there are less expensive ways to sanitize a cow prior to milking  and many producers opt for a less expensive solution 
we are competing aggressively on selling price to earn new business against less expensive products and alternative teat sanitizing methods 
sales of cmt decreased by during the year ended december  in comparison to we sell bulk reagents outside of the dairy and beef industries for use in a drinking water test that is sold by others known as isolate formerly known as crypto scan

we generally held our product selling prices without increase during the seven year period ended december  during the first quarter of  we implemented a modest increase to the selling price of first defense 
we have implemented no significant price increases since then  believing that we could benefit more from higher unit sales than through a higher average selling price per unit

this compares to gross margin percentages of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our current annual target is to maintain the gross margin percentage above 
a number of factors account for the variability in our costs 
we expect some fluctuations in gross margin percentages from quarter to quarter 
the gross margin on first defense is affected by biological yields from our raw material  which do fluctuate over time 
more generally  costs for production of first defense and wipe out dairy wipes have increased due to increased labor costs and expenses associated with our efforts to sustain compliance with cgmp regulations in our production processes 
like most us manufacturers  we have been experiencing increases in the cost of raw materials that we purchase 
we have been able to minimize the impact of these cost increases by implementing yield improvements 
product mix also affects gross margin in that we earn a higher gross margin on first defense and a lower gross margin on wipe out dairy wipes

our net loss of  or per share  during the year ended december  compares to a net loss of  or per share  during critical accounting policies the financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
all professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  contingencies and the useful lives and carrying values of intangible and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of our business and understanding our financial statements 
immucell corporation we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
royalty income is recorded on the accrual basis based on sales as reported to us by our licensee pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement 
all research and development costs and patent costs are expensed as incurred 
inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are recorded at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on the first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
work in process and finished goods inventories include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that neither inflation nor interest rates nor currency exchange rates have had a significant effect on our revenues and expenses 
however  future increases in inflation or interest rates or the value of the us dollar could affect our customers and the demand for our products 
we hedged our interest rate exposure to a  mortgage with an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted a floating interest rate to the fixed rate of 
the interest rate on our  note is variable 
if the london interbank offered rate plus exceeds  our interest payments will increase over the current amount 
we hope to increase the level of our future sales of products outside the united states 
the cost of our products to international customers could be affected by currency fluctuations 
the decline of the us dollar against other currencies could make our products less expensive to international customers 
we do not anticipate that currency fluctuations will significantly affect our sales or the cost of operations
