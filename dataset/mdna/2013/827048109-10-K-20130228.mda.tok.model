item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading manufacturer of rigid packaging for shelf stable food and other consumer goods products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food and general line products  metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products and plastic closures for the dairy and juice markets  and custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  food  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products 
we are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in north america and europe  the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america with a unit volume market share for the year ended december  of approximately half of the market in the united states  a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products and a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for a variety of markets  including the personal care  food  health care and household and industrial chemical markets 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business  reduce operating costs  build sustainable competitive positions  or franchises  and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have grown our net sales and income from operations largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth  and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market 
sales growth we have increased net sales and market share in our metal container  closures and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
in  we expanded our metal container business into central and eastern europe with our acquisition of vn 
as a result  we are now a leading manufacturer of metal containers in north america and europe 
through vn  we are further expanding into developing eastern countries  with three new locations becoming operational recently and an additional new location expected to become operational in the near term in such area 
in  we further expanded our metal container business into the turkish market with our acquisition of nta 
during the past twenty six years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestl  dial  del monte  birds eye  campbell  pacific coast and  most recently  purina steel can reflect this trend 
we estimate that approximately five percent of the market for metal food containers in the united states is still served by self manufacturers 
in addition  the metal food container market in north america has been relatively flat during this period  despite losing market share as a result of more dining out  fresh produce and competing materials 
however  we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the united states primarily through acquisitions  and we have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and 
table of contents value added features such as our quick top easy open ends  shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers 
we anticipate that the market will be relatively flat in the future  but will continue to increase in areas of consumer convenience products such as single serve sizes and easy open ends 
in  approximately percent of our metal food containers sold had an easy open end 
with our acquisitions of our closures operations in north america  europe  asia and south america  we established ourselves as a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products  with leadership positions in the north american and european markets 
in  we expanded our closures business into the turkish market with our acquisition of nta 
in  we broadened our closures business through our acquisition of ipec which manufactures plastic closures primarily for the north american dairy and juice markets 
we may pursue further consolidation opportunities in the closures markets in which we operate 
additionally  we expect to continue to generate internal growth in our closures business  particularly in plastic vacuum closures 
we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with net sales increasing almost sevenfold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth 
in  we completed the strategic acquisition of pfc  broadening our product offerings for shelf stable food products to include plastic thermoformed barrier and non barrier bowls and trays 
the plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry continues to be highly fragmented  with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials 
we have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care 
we intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value added operating expertise and strategy 
operating performance we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
we have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
our acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling 
from  we have closed three metal container manufacturing facilities  one closures manufacturing facility and four plastic container manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations  reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand 
in addition  we have consolidated various positions in our corporate offices across all businesses to further enhance profitability 
we have also invested substantial capital in the past several years for new market opportunities and value added products such as new quick top easy open ends for metal food containers  shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers 
in addition  we have made significant capital investments to expand vn into new developing eastern countries 
over the past five years  we have invested million in capital to invest in new market opportunities  maintain our market position  improve our productivity and reduce our manufacturing costs 
historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers 
we estimate that in approximately percent of our projected north american metal container sales  a majority of our projected closures sales in the united states and a majority of our projected plastic container sales will be under multi year arrangements 
many of our multi year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure 
table of contents of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
in recent years  the steel industry announced significant price increases for steel 
under our supply arrangements in the united states  we were able to increase prices to pass through higher metal costs 
for our non contract domestic customers  we have also generally increased prices to pass through higher metal costs 
in europe  our businesses have had long term relationships with many of their customers and we have generally increased prices to pass through higher metal costs  although  as is common practice  many supply arrangements are negotiated on a year by year basis 
resin prices have also fluctuated significantly in the past few years  and we have been able to pass through changes in resin costs in accordance with our supply arrangements 
our metal container business sales and income from operations are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states and  to a lesser extent  in a variety of national growing regions in europe 
our closures business is also dependent  in part  upon vegetable and fruit harvests 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
additionally  as is common in the packaging industry  we provide extended payment terms to some of our customers in our metal container business due to the seasonality of the vegetable and fruit packing process 
use of capital historically  we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using reasonable leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in determining reasonable leverage  we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions 
if acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time  we may use our cash flow to repay debt  repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted purposes 
in march  we funded the purchase price for vn with euro denominated borrowings under our credit facility 
in  we also refinanced our credit facility with our new billion credit agreement  which provides us with greater borrowing availability and greater flexibility for acquisitions  repurchases of stock and other strategic initiatives  and we funded repurchases of our common stock for million and the purchase price for purina steel can with cash on hand 
in march  we issued million of the notes and used part of the proceeds from that issuance to redeem all million of the notes 
in  we also funded repurchases of our common stock for million and the purchase price for our acquisitions of nta and pfc with cash on hand 
additionally  in november  we commenced a modified dutch auction tender offer  pursuant to which we purchased  shares of our common stock for million on february  we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents on hand  of which we used million to fund the purchase price for the  shares of our common stock that we purchased on february  pursuant to our tender offer and the remainder of which we can use to fund our working capital requirements or for other strategic initiatives 
in addition  at december   after taking into account letters of credit of million  we had million and cdn million of revolving loans available to us under our credit agreement for working capital requirements and other strategic initiatives 
to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at 
table of contents december  we had million of indebtedness  or percent of our total outstanding indebtedness  which bore interest at floating rates 
you should read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report for information regarding our interest rate swap agreements 
in light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense

because we sell metal containers and closures used in fruit and vegetable pack processing  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the packing season 
due to our seasonal requirements  which generally peak sometime in the summer or early fall  we may incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
in recent years  our seasonal working capital requirements have peaked at approximately million 
in  our seasonal working capital requirements were funded with cash on hand and revolving loans under our credit agreement 
for  we expect to fund our peak seasonal working capital requirements with our revolving loan facilities 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities under our credit agreement  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  dividends  stock repurchases and refinancing and repurchases of other debt 
in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of up to million of our common stock  inclusive of prior authorizations  from time to time through and including december  on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional million of our common stock from time to time through and including december  pursuant to these authorizations  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price per share of  for a total purchase price of million  in  and  shares of our common stock at an average price per share of  for a total purchase price of million  in on november   we commenced a modified dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to million of our common stock

table of contents in addition to our operating cash needs and excluding any impact from pending acquisitions  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years will consist primarily of annual capital expenditures of million to million  principal amortization payments of bank term loans under our credit agreement and other outstanding debt agreements of million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million in  cash payments for quarterly dividends on our common stock as approved by our board of directors  annual payments to satisfy employee withholding tax requirements resulting from certain restricted stock units becoming vested  which payments are dependent upon the price of our common stock at the time of vesting and the number of restricted stock units that vest  none of which is estimable at this time payments in were not significant  our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and term loans under our credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  and the notes  payments of approximately million to million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in  which may increase annually thereafter  and payments for pension benefit plan contributions  which will be dependent on the funded status of our pension benefit plans 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service  tax obligations  pension benefit plan contributions  share repurchases required under our stock incentive plan and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under our credit agreement  to finance any such acquisition 
our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets  pay dividends and engage in certain transactions 
the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to create liens  engage in sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate  merge or sell assets 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions long term debt obligations interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other postretirement benefit obligations total these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our variable rate long term debt  after taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreements  at prevailing interest rates at december  purchase obligations represent commitments for capital expenditures of million

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials subject to contractual lag periods and to significantly reduce the exposure of our results of operations to increases in other costs  such as labor and other manufacturing costs 
because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had  million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent and receive floating rates of interest based on three month libor or euribor  as applicable 
these agreements mature as follows million notional principal amount in and million notional principal amount in in addition  we have entered into two other interest rate swap agreements  each for million notional principal amount  with forward start dates in and that mature in depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility

we use a disciplined approach to identify opportunities that generate attractive cash returns 

table of contents critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for pension expense and obligations  rationalization charges and acquisition reserves and testing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for non callable high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension benefit plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense  while an increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense 
a basis point change in the discount rate would impact our annual pension expense by approximately million 
for  we decreased our domestic discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension benefit plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets will remain at percent in you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on market participant perspectives when available and our business plans for the acquired entities  which include eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our tests for impairment require us to make assumptions regarding the expected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units 
these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts 
developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from these forecasts 
if an impairment were to be identified  it could result in additional expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and  with respect to our international metal container and closures operations and our canadian plastic container operations  from foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we also have risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks 
interest rate  foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow 
to achieve our objective  we regularly evaluate the amount of our variable rate debt as a percentage of our aggregate debt 
during and  our average outstanding variable rate debt  
table of contents after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements  was percent and percent of our average outstanding total debt  respectively 
at december   our outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements  was approximately percent of our outstanding total debt 
we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in our variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
we have entered into these agreements with banks under our credit agreement  and our obligations under these agreements are guaranteed and secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under our credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the principal and notional amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
based on the average outstanding amount of our variable rate indebtedness in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness would have impacted our interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements during foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  we conduct a portion of our manufacturing and sales activity outside the united states  primarily in europe and canada 
in an effort to minimize foreign currency exchange risk  we have financed our acquisitions of our european and canadian operations primarily with term loans borrowed under our credit agreement denominated in euros and canadian dollars  respectively 
our european operations include non euro denominated entities  including  most significantly  in poland  russia  hungary  turkey and the united kingdom 
we also have operations in asia and south america that are not considered significant to our consolidated financial statements 
where available  we have borrowed funds in local currency or implemented certain internal hedging strategies to minimize our foreign currency risk related to foreign operations 
in addition  we are exposed to gains and losses from limited transactions of our operations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of such operations 
we are also exposed to possible losses in the event of a currency devaluation in any of the foreign countries where we have operations 
we generally do not utilize external derivative financial instruments to manage our foreign currency risk 
commodity pricing risk we purchase raw materials for our products such as metal and resins 
these raw materials are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  we do not engage in hedging activities for these raw materials due to our ability to pass on price changes to our customers 
we also purchase commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and are subject to risks on the pricing of these commodities 
in general  we purchase these commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
we manage a portion of our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
during and  we entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
as of december   we had entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our expected exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price 
you should also read notes and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the terms necessary to evaluate these transactions 
based on our natural gas usage in  a ten percent change in natural gas costs would have impacted our cost of goods sold by approximately million  after taking into account our natural gas swap agreements
