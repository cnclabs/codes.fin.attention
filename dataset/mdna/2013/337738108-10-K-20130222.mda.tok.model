results of operations 
this section contains an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  and by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at december  overview company background we are a leading global provider of financial services technology 
we provide account processing systems  electronic payments processing products and services  internet and mobile banking systems  and related services 
we serve approximately  clients worldwide  including banks  thrifts  credit unions  investment management firms  leasing and finance companies  retailers  merchants and government agencies 
the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transaction based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years 
we also have had high contract renewal rates with our clients 
the majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are  therefore  non discretionary in nature 
our operations are primarily in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products payments segment and the financial institution services financial segment 
the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services  debit and other card based payment products and services  internet and mobile banking software and services  and other electronic payments software and services including account to account transfers and person to person payments 
our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts  card and print personalization services  and fraud and risk management products and services 
the financial segment provides banks  thrifts and credit unions with account processing services  item processing and source capture services  loan origination and servicing products  cash management and consulting services  and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 
the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations 
on january   we acquired open solutions inc open solutions  a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions for a cash purchase price of million 
we also assumed approximately million of open solutions debt in connection with the acquisition 
this acquisition advances fiserv s go to market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide a broad array of our add on solutions 
in september  we acquired cashedge inc cashedge  a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as account to account transfer  account opening and funding  data aggregation  small business invoicing and payments  and person to person payments  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
the acquisition of cashedge has advanced our digital payments strategy 
in the first quarter of  we acquired mobile commerce ltd 
m com  an international mobile banking and payments provider  and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
m com has enhanced our mobile and payments capabilities  and the other acquired companies have added to or enhanced specific products or services that we already provide 
enterprise priorities we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best in class results for our clients 
these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses  enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships  improving operational effectiveness  being disciplined in our allocation of capital  and differentiating our products and services through innovation 
our key enterprise priorities for are i to continue to build high quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments  ii to extend market momentum into deeper client relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions  and iii to deliver innovation and integration to enhance results for our clients 
industry trends market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the united states and internationally 
in addition  legislation such as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated  and will continue to generate  numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry 
financial institutions have generally remained cautious in their information technology spending as a result 
these conditions have  however  created interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers  generate incremental revenue and enhance operating efficiency 
examples of these solutions include our digital channels and electronic payments solutions  including mobile banking and person to person payments 
despite the difficult environment over the past several years  our revenue increased to billion in as compared to  our net income per share from continuing operations increased to as compared to in  which included a loss from early debt extinguishment in of per share  and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million 
we believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring  fee based revenue model  the largely non discretionary nature of our products and services  and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry 
we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in house technology solutions to outsourced solutions 
during the past years  the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately per year 
this decline is primarily a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions  although in the past several years was also due to government actions 
in  the number of government actions continued to decline as compared to and although these reductions in the number of financial institutions resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients  bank failures and forced consolidations have been  to some extent  offset by a general decline in the number of mergers and acquisitions among financial institutions 
a consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform  or elects to move to one of our platforms  and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected 
consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi year client contracts 
contract termination fees are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi year contract is acquired by another financial institution 
these fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated 
we generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action 
business developments we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments  including popmoney for person to person payments  mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services  and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions 
we believe our wide range of market leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace 
critical accounting policies general our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 
acquisitions we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets  such as intangible assets  can be complex and require significant judgments 
we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists  when necessary  to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long lived assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level  determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below 
we have not aggregated any operating segments into reporting units for purposes of conducting goodwill impairment testing 
when reviewing goodwill for impairment  we first assess numerous qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values 
examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price  our financial performance  market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units 
if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  or to the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units  then we perform a quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step in this test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit s net assets  goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and any impairment charge 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
based on the most recent fair value estimates  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 
we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value 
given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances  an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
based on our impairment assessments in  we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transaction based fees 
deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services 
revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long term in nature  generally three to five years  and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions 
additionally  given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition  our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations 
additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations components of revenue and expenses the following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income 
a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
processing and services processing and services revenue  which in represented of our consolidated revenue  is primarily generated from account and transaction based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years 
revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed 
processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services 
cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following personnel  equipment and data communication  infrastructure costs  including costs to maintain software applications  client support  depreciation and amortization  and other operating expenses 
product product revenue  which in represented of our consolidated revenue  is derived from integrated print and card production and software licenses 
cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following costs of materials and software development  personnel  infrastructure costs  depreciation and amortization  and other costs directly associated with product revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries  wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel  administrative employees  and management  advertising and promotional costs  depreciation and amortization  and other selling and administrative expenses

revenue from acquired companies totaled million and million in and  respectively  and positively impacted revenue growth by approximately two percentage points and one percentage point in the respective periods 
in addition  higher postage pass through revenue  which is included in both product revenue and cost of product in our output solutions business  contributed to growth in this segment by approximately one percentage point in and three percentage points in the positive growth in was partially offset by lower revenue in our electronic bill payment business  driven primarily by the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution

cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to in and increased to in from in in and  cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operating efficiency initiatives across the company that lowered our overall cost structure 
in  this positive impact was offset by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services 
cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was in compared to in and in the increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in was primarily due to a decrease in high margin software license sales as compared to the cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in both and was also impacted by an increase in postage pass through revenue and expenses in our output solutions business

operating margin increased to in from in and decreased in from in the operating margin improvement of basis points in was due in part to increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operational effectiveness activities that lowered our overall cost structure

operating margin in was consistent with the operating loss in the corporate and other segment decreased million in and increased million in compared to the prior years 
the changes in operating loss were primarily due to employee severance and merger and integration costs which  in total  decreased million in and increased million in as compared to the respective prior year periods 
in addition  the remaining increase in was also attributable to higher amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  and million  or  in and  respectively  compared to the prior years

liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses  ii to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness  and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments 
we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations  our cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility

at december   our long term debt consisted primarily of billion of senior notes and million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in the acquisition of open solutions on january  for a cash purchase price of million and repayment of assumed debt of million was funded in utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility in august  we entered into a billion amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  replacing our existing billion revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in september borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate at december  
there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements 
the facility expires on august  and contains various restrictions and covenants that require us  among other things  to i limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one half times consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended  and ii maintain consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended 
senior notes in september  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in october  which pay interest semi annually on april and october of each year  commencing on april  in june  we issued billion of senior notes comprised of million of senior notes due in june and million of senior notes due in june  which pay interest semi annually on june and december of each year 
our senior notes due in october and our senior notes due in october pay interest at the stated rate on april and october of each year 
our senior notes due in november pay interest at the stated rate on may and november of each year 
the interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other matters  limit i our ability to consolidate or merge into  or convey  transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to  another person  ii our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to create or assume liens  and iii our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions 
in june  we purchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in november in a tender offer for million  and in july  we redeemed the remaining million aggregate principal amount of these notes for million 
senior term loan our senior term loan matured in november and was repaid using a combination of proceeds from the september issuance of senior notes  our revolving credit facility and available cash 
term loan borrowings under this facility bore interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate 
interest rate hedge contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  we maintained forward starting swaps  designated as cash flow hedges  with a total notional value of million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted five year and ten year fixed rate borrowings 
upon the issuance of senior notes in september  we paid million  included in cash flows from operating activities  to settle the forward starting swaps and recognized approximately million of interest expense due to hedge ineffectiveness 
the remaining million is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income taxes of million  and will be recognized as interest expense over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments 
in addition  we maintained interest rate swap agreements swaps  designated as cash flow hedges  with a total notional value of billion to hedge against changes in interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings 
the swaps  which expired in september  effectively fixed the interest rate on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted average rate of approximately prior to financing spreads and related fees 
there were no swaps outstanding as of december  shelf registration statement in  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  we may sell common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  or a combination thereof 
each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering 
we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers  through agents  directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital  our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our debt securities  perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had a credit rating of baa with a stable outlook from moody s investors service  inc moody s and bbb with a stable outlook from standard poor s ratings services s p on our senior unsecured debt securities 
the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody s or s p downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes 
if the ratings from moody s or s p decrease below investment grade  the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to two percent 
in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed two percent above the original interest rate 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet variable interest entities or other off balance sheet financing  other than letters of credit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  currency exchange rates  indices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt  investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency 
we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
in connection with processing electronic payments transactions  the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients 
these subscriber funds are primarily invested in short term instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government 
subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity 
based on average subscriber funds balances during of approximately billion  a increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pre tax income by approximately million  and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero  our annual pre tax income would decrease by less than million 
we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and previously through the use of interest rate hedge contracts 
we previously maintained interest rate swap agreements with total notional values of billion and forward starting swaps with a total notional value of million to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs 
all interest rate hedge contracts were settled or expired in september based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december   a increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in by less than million 
we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non us dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions 
in  of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates were higher or lower at december   there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position
