item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition together with the selected financial data and the audited historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risk factors section of this prospectus 
actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur  and you are urged to review and consider disclosures that we make in this and other reports that discuss factors germane to our business 
company overview and business strategy we are engaged in the development  manufacture and marketing of electronic table games and related products for casinos  cruise lines  racinos  card clubs and lotteries worldwide 
we distribute our electronic table games using an internal sales force  complemented by distributors and sales agents in select geographic areas  generally on a recurring revenue participation model  recurring revenue fixed license fee model or as a sale of hardware combined with recurring license and support fees 
as of december   our installed base consisted of  gaming positions  composed of  pokerpro and procore positions 
pokerpro is a seat electronic poker table that allows operators to offer the most popular player banked games and tournaments 
the pokerpro system offers cash games  single table tournaments and multi table tournaments with an extensive game library including texas hold em  omaha  razz  and seven card stud 
game rules and limits  including blinds  antes  rake structures and house rules  are completely configurable 
procore is a unique electronic table game platform that expands on the pokerpro technology and allows multiple house banked games to be run on a single  efficient  economical platform 
the versatility of the procore system allows operators to add new game content as it is released 
games and house rules can be customized easily to meet property and regulatory requirements  making it an ideal choice for operators looking to add an automated solution to their gaming floor 
we distribute our electronic table games using an internal sales force  complemented by distributors and sales agents in select geographic areas  generally on a recurring revenue participation model  recurring revenue fixed license fee model or as a sale of hardware combined with recurring license and support fees 
we use an analytical approach and segment the market for our electronic table games into three categories those with no competition from manual table games  those with limited competition from manual table games  and those markets characterized by a high level of saturation of manual table games 
we intentionally focus the majority of our sales and marketing effort on those markets that have either no or limited competition from manual table games 
we also opportunistically place tables in markets with higher saturation of manual table games where we have a unique value proposition for the operators and players 
this approach allows us to narrow our focus  directing our limited resources in a targeted approach  and has significantly improved customer retention 
in those identified markets  we plan to increase our dominant position in electronic poker with our pokerpro system 
with the recent addition of the procore platform  the addressable opportunities are expanded with blackjack and other electronic house banked games 
the market for electronic poker is a smaller niche where we enjoy a dominant market position 
the market for electronic blackjack and specialty player banked games is larger  but also characterized by more competition 
we believe our products offer significant competitive advantages over other competing systems and platforms and  as a result  we are well positioned to increase our market share of the electronic poker market  while increasing the market for electronic house banked games and displacing competitor products in those markets 
we have identified key markets worldwide that meet our market segmentation criteria and we believe those markets provide actionable opportunities to grow significantly 
we are also monitoring changes in regulation at the state  federal and international level and believe that budgetary  legislative and other factors are becoming favorable for expansion of gaming and electronic table games in particular 
results of operations statement of operations selected data year ended december  change revenue license and service fees sales of systems and equipment total revenue gross profit percentage of revenue operating expenses interest expense  net income tax provision net loss from continuing operations net income loss from discontinued operations net loss results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
revenue from north america increased with new installations in canada and the united states in the second half of however  revenue comparisons to the prior year were impacted by several factors  including the timing of our reentry in mexico  a trend of declining economic conditions in eastern europe  and a shift in our revenue mix from hardware sales to more recurring revenue in as a result  total annual revenue was million in compared to million in  a reduction of 
revenue from license and service fees was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in  our revenue was more heavily weighted towards recurring revenue license and service fees  whereas the prior year was more heavily weighted towards sales of systems and equipment 
the change in sales mix creates unfavorable total revenue comparisons to prior year  but also represents an increase in the base of recurring revenue carrying forward to gross profit 
gross profit was million for year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
gross profit as a percent of revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit margins improved primarily due to changes in sales mix which are more heavily weighted to higher margin recurring revenue  as well as reduced product costs and depreciation 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as we implemented cost reduction initiatives which have streamlined our overhead and reduced spending on personnel  regulatory approvals  and professional fees 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest expense on lower balances of the founders loans described below  lower fees associated with our credit facility at silicon valley bank described below  and the payoff of the capital lease obligations in income tax provision 
income tax provision was  for the year ended december  and  in the comparable period of the increase in income tax provision was attributable to higher withholdings in foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax provision increased as compared to the prior year due to increased revenue from canada and other foreign jurisdictions subject to withholding and also included a non recurring true up related to income taxes withheld in romania 
net loss from continuing operations 
net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  an improvement of million from million for the year ended december  net loss from continuing operations was per share for the year ended december   an improvement of per share compared to for the comparable period of the improvement in net loss from continuing operations resulted primarily from reductions in operating expenses 
net income loss from discontinued operations 
net income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was  per share compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of  per share for the year ended december net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  an improvement of million from million for the year ended december  net loss per share was for the year ended december   an improvement of per share compared to a net loss per share of for the comparable period of the improvement in net loss resulted primarily from reductions in operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses for all annual periods since inception 
we have typically funded our operating costs  research and development activities  working capital investments and capital expenditures associated with our growth strategy with proceeds from the issuances of our common stock and other financing arrangements 
in order to finance our operations  we entered into equity transactions to raise capital and also maintained a credit facility  which are described in more detail below and in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we expect our revenues and earnings to increase in future periods  and we expect to reinvest these earnings in additional inventory and working capital to fund anticipated grown in our recurring revenue business 
discussion of statement of cash flows years ended december  change continuing operations net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash used in continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of period for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was essentially unchanged  improving to  compared to  for the year ended december  while net loss from continuing operations improved by approximately million  non cash add backs decreased by approximately million on lower depreciation  shared based compensation expense and doubtful accounts  and cash used for working capital decreased by approximately million as compared with net cash used in investing activities decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  as part of our ongoing cost reduction measures  we have curtailed capital expenditures  with the exception of investments required to support operations  including replacing aged equipment where necessary 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities is due primarily to the issuance of common stock in the years ended december  and as our operating results improved in  we reduced the level of our common stock being issued to fund our operations as compared to the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to the sale of the remaining discontinued inventory during equity offerings private placement transactions during august  we sold  shares of our common stock to four unaffiliated accredited investors as defined under the securities act at a price of for an aggregate purchase price of  in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act pursuant to section and rule of regulation d promulgated under the securities act 
on march   we sold  shares of our common stock to ten unaffiliated accredited investors as defined under the securities act at a price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of  in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the act pursuant to section and rule of regulation d promulgated under the act 
this private placement transaction occurred subsequent to december  and is therefore not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
lincoln park transaction in  we entered into a purchase agreement with lincoln park capital  llc lpc  pursuant to which we had the right  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  to sell and lpc was obligated to purchase from us up to  worth of shares of our common stock 
one of those conditions was that the shares had to be covered by an effective registration statement at the time of sale 
in  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to lpc for gross proceeds of  under the purchase agreement 
as of december   all of the shares covered by the registration statement filed in connection with the purchase agreement had been issued 
the registration statement that we filed with respect to the lpc purchase agreement was declared effective on november  on march  we filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus included in that registration statement that included our annual report on form k for the year ended december  the annual report 
the annual report  including our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended december   and the notes thereto  were physically attached and incorporated into the prospectus supplement 
at the time  we believed that the filing of this prospectus supplement fulfilled our obligation to update the registration with current financial information pursuant to section a of the securities act 
however  we were subsequently advised that the proper manner for updating a registration statement is to file a post effective amendment 
as a result   shares sold pursuant to that prospectus in open market transactions from december  through january  violated section of the securities act  and the purchasers of those shares may have rescission rights if they still own the shares or claims for damages if they no longer own the shares 
shares that are subject to rescission or redemption requirements that are outside of our control are classified outside of permanent equity until they are no longer subject to rescission or redemption 
accordingly  we reclassified  as common stock subject to rescission 
to date  no claims for rescission or damages have been made 
warrants as of december   the following warrants were outstanding  common stock warrants at an exercise price of with an expiration date of march  issued in connection with a private placement in may  and  common stock warrants at an exercise price of with an expiration date of december  issued in connection with the lpc transaction 
debt financings founders loan on march   we entered into a note purchase agreement the note purchase agreement for million with lyle a 
berman  james t 
crawford  arthur l 
lomax and gehrig h 
white collectively  the lenders  all of whom were founders of pokertek and members of our board of directors at the time 
pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement  the lenders loaned us million the founders loan 
since that time the principal balance of the debt outstanding under the founders loan has been reduced to  through a series of transactions  including the transaction described below which took place during the year ended december  the founders loan contains no restrictive covenants and is collateralized by security interests in pokerpro systems 
such security interests have been subordinated to the svb credit facility 
on july   we entered into a second loan modification agreement the second loan modification agreement with messrs 
lomax and white  the remaining makers of the founders loan 
pursuant to the second loan modification agreement   of the remaining principal balance of the founders loan was converted into  shares of our common stock  reflecting a conversion price of per share  the closing price of a share of our common stock on friday  july  as reported by the nasdaq capital market 
on september   we issued  shares of our common stock to gehrig h 
white in full satisfaction of the entire outstanding principal amount of a note held by mr 
white 
the shares were valued at per share  which represented the consolidated closing bid price per share on the nasdaq capital market on september  as a result of this transaction  the remaining principal balance on the founders loan was reduced to  as a result of the modifications described above  the terms of the founders loan as of december  are as follows i from july  through december   payments continued to be interest only  calculated at the rate of per annum  on the remaining principal balance 
ii beginning february  and the first day of each calendar month thereafter until january   we will make monthly payments of interest and principal in the amount of  the amount required to fully amortize the remaining principal balance and the accrued interest thereon over months 
in the event of a prepayment  the monthly amount would be recalculated 
iii the remaining principal balance of the founders loan and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon is finally due and payable on december  credit facility we maintain a credit facility with silicon valley bank to support our working capital needs the svb credit facility 
as of march   we entered into the seventh amendment to loan and security agreement  which extended the maturity date for the facility to january  maximum advances are determined based on the composition of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances with a facility limit of  the svb credit facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of or prime plus 
as of december   was available under the svb credit facility  based on our accounts receivable and inventory levels  and there were no amounts outstanding under the facility 
operations and liquidity management historically  we have incurred net losses and used cash from financing activities to fund our operations in each annual period since inception 
in recent years  we refocused our business strategies  significantly improved our margins  and reduced our operating expenses  while also expanding our growth opportunities and significantly improving our operating results 
we also closed several equity transactions  reduced our long term debt  and renewed our credit facility to improve our liquidity and provide capital to grow our business 
as of december   our cash balance was  and availability from our credit line was  cash used in operations for the year ended december  was  including inventory purchases 
the level of additional cash needed to fund operations and our ability to conduct business for the next year is influenced primarily by the following factors the pace of growth in our recurring revenue gaming business  the related investments in inventory and level of spending on development and regulatory efforts  the launch of new additional products  entry into new markets  and investments in regulatory approvals  our ability to control growth of operating expenses as we grow the business  expand with new products in new markets  our ability to negotiate favorable payment terms with our customers and vendors  our ability to access the capital markets and maintain availability under our credit line  demand for our products  and the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis  and general economic conditions as well as political events and legal and regulatory changes 
our operating plans call for entering new markets  launching new products and accelerating revenue growth while controlling operating expense and working capital levels 
as we execute our growth plans  we intend to carefully monitor the impact of growth on our working capital needs and cash balances 
we have demonstrated a trend of improving operating results over the past two years  and we expect those improving trends to continue into we believe the capital resources available to us from our cash balances  credit facility  cash generated by improving the results of our operations and cash from financing activities will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and to support our operating plans for at least the next months 
however  we may seek to raise additional capital or expand our credit facility to fund growth 
we cannot assure you that  in the event we need additional working capital  adequate additional working capital will be available or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to raise additional capital or expand our credit facilities  our ability to conduct business and achieve our growth objectives would be negatively impacted 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our net sales  revenues or income from continuing operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the table below sets forth our known contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total represents the outstanding principal amount and interest on the founders loan 
represents operating lease agreements for office and storage facilities and office equipment 
we recently exercised an option to extend this lease through august  the operating lease obligations in the table above have been adjusted to reflect that lease as if the extension had been in effect as of december  represents open purchase orders with our vendors 
represents purchase of gaming inventory from aristocrat international pty 
limited and its affiliates aristocrat  our former international distribution agent 
customer dependence for the year ended december   five of our customers made up approximately of our total revenues from continuing operations  with one accounting for  a second accounting for  a third accounting for  a fourth accounting for  and a fifth accounting for 
the loss of any of these customers or changes in our relationship with any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note nature of business and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we completed a to reverse stock split on february  as a result of the reverse stock split  every shares of common stock were combined into share of common stock 
all consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to february  have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
research and development research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred and are included in the consolidated statements of operations  except when certain qualifying expenses are capitalized 
capitalization of development costs of software products begins once the technological feasibility of the product is established 
capitalization ceases when such software is ready for general release  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
as of december  and  no amounts were capitalized as technological feasibility is generally established at or near the time of general release 
research and development costs include salaries  benefits  travel and other internal costs allocated to software and hardware development efforts  as well as purchased components  engineering services and other third party costs 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  where cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventories also include parts from gaming systems that have been used at customer sites and returned for refurbishment and subsequent redeployment with customer 
those inventory items are stated at the lower of cost or market  where cost is determined based on the undepreciated cost of the returned items 
we regularly review inventory for slow moving  obsolete and excess characteristics and evaluate whether inventory is sated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb amended the asc as summarized in asu no 
software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu amends industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions to exclude from its scope tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
asu amends the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to provide guidance on how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and eliminates the use of the residual method 
asu also requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we make judgments which include the allocation of proceeds from multiple deliverable arrangements to individual units of accounting and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of asu and asu for new and materially modified arrangements originating on or after january  the adoption of asu and asu increased net revenue reported for the year ended december  by million as compared to the amount that would have been reported had we still been subject to the prior revenue guidance for all transactions 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  was due to the recognition of revenue that would have been previously deferred for multiple deliverable arrangements  which include hardware with embedded software  professional services and post contract customer support pcs  where we were unable to establish vender specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for pcs 
under the previous accounting guidance in asc topic  which continues to be followed for transactions entered into prior to january   revenue from software related multiple deliverable arrangements was deferred and recognized as pcs was delivered due to the absence of vsoe for pcs which is a requirement for separation of units of accounting under asc topic the new standard allows for deliverables for which revenue would have been previously deferred to be separated into units of accounting with amounts allocated based on relative selling price if the delivered items have stand alone value 
as a result  for many of our multiple deliverable transactions where revenue was previously deferred and recognized as pcs was delivered  revenue is now recognized as each deliverable representing a separate unit of accounting is delivered 
we expect the adoption to have a material impact on future periods  however we cannot estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature and volume of new or materially modified arrangements in any given period 
for contracts considered multiple deliverable arrangements that were entered into or materially modified during or after which are subject to the new accounting guidance  we evaluate each deliverable to determine whether they represent a separate unit of accounting 
the delivered item constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand alone value and there are no customer negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered items where performance of the undelivered item is not considered probable and substantially in our control 
in instances when the aforementioned criteria are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined for the combined unit as a single unit of accounting 
allocation of arrangement consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit s relative selling price 
our multiple deliverable product offerings include both the sale and lease of gaming system hardware with embedded software  and the provision of professional services and pcs 
the gaming system hardware and the embedded software are considered a single unit of accounting on a combined basis under the new accounting guidance as the software is essential to the functionality of the hardware  and the software is never sold separately from the hardware 
the professional services and pcs are each considered separate units of accounting 
for fiscal year and future periods  pursuant to the guidance in asu  when a sale or lease arrangement contains multiple deliverables  we allocate revenues to each unit of accounting based on the selling price hierarchy vsoe  third party evidence tpe  and the best estimate of selling price besp 
if vsoe is available  it must be used to determine the selling price of a deliverable 
if vsoe is not available  the entity would determine whether tpe is available 
if so  tpe must be used to determine the selling price 
if tpe is not available  then the besp would be used 
we have not been able to establish vsoe for any deliverables in an arrangement with multiple deliverables due to infrequent sales of each item separately  not pricing products within a narrow range  or only having a limited sales history 
when vsoe cannot be established  we attempt to determine the standalone selling price for each deliverable based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
we have been unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
therefore  we have not been able to establish tpe for any deliverables 
since we have typically been unable to determine vsoe or tpe  we use besp in its allocation of the arrangement consideration for contracts 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for product or service considering multiple factors and data points  including  but not limited to  internal costs  gross margin objectives and pricing practices for standalone sales and when products are sold with other deliverables 
market conditions and competitive factors are taken into account in determining our pricing practices 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered items to the amount of besp that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
for product sale arrangements containing multiple deliverables  revenue is generally recognized upfront for the hardware and embedded software unit of accounting in the amount allocated based on the relative selling price method using besp 
revenue allocated to professional services installation and training is recognized as those services are delivered  which usually occurs at or near the time of delivery of the hardware and embedded software unit of accounting gaming system 
revenue allocated to pcs services is recognized as those services are delivered on a ratable basis over the pcs term 
revenue recognized from the delivery of gaming systems and installation and training services are limited to those amounts that are not contingent upon the delivery of future pcs or other services 
our lease arrangements are generally accounted for as operating leases as the terms are typically less than or equal to one year and they do not contain bargain purchase options  transfer of ownership or have minimum lease payments greater than of the fair value of the leased equipment 
for lease arrangements containing multiple deliverables  revenue from fixed fee leases of hardware and embedded software is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
for leases where consideration varies based on the monthly amount of revenue earned by the customer  revenue is generally recognized on a monthly basis as the lease price for each period becomes fixed and determinable 
to the extent that installation and training services are provided in a lease arrangement  those professional services are treated as separate units of accounting and the allocated amounts are recognized as those services are delivered  limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of future services 
if a customer initially leases gaming systems and subsequently purchases the equipment  revenue is recorded on the effective date of the purchase agreement and when all other relevant revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in addition to selling multiple deliverable arrangements  we also sell certain products and services on a stand alone basis that were not specifically affected by the adoption of asu and asu these transactions would include the sale of complete gaming systems a rare occurrence and the sale of spare parts and other peripheral equipment separately from the delivery of other products and services under multiple deliverable arrangements 
regardless of whether a transaction is a multiple deliverable transaction subject to asu and asu or a stand alone transaction  revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
if customer arrangements require formal notification of acceptance by the customer  revenue is recognized upon meeting such acceptance criteria 
gaming systems and property and equipment our gaming systems represent equipment owned by us 
the majority of this equipment is operated at customer sites pursuant to contractual license agreements 
our gaming systems may also include equipment used by us for demonstration or testing purposes 
our gaming systems are transferred from our respective inventory accounts to the gaming systems account at the time the units are fully assembled  configured  tested and otherwise ready for use by a customer 
because the configuration of each gaming system is unique to the specific customer environment in which it is being placed  the final steps to configure and test the unit generally occur immediately prior to shipment 
depreciation expense for our gaming systems begins in the month of transfer of each gaming system from our inventory account to the gaming systems account 
our gaming systems and property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
we include an allocation of direct labor  indirect labor and overhead for each gaming system 
costs not clearly related to the procurement  manufacture and implementation are expensed as incurred 
as gaming systems are returned from customer sites  the hardware components are dismantled and transferred to inventory at depreciated cost  and all labor  overhead and installation costs capitalized in connection with the original installation are expensed immediately 
as the gaming systems are returned to our warehouse  the various hardware components are individually disassembled  inspected  tested  thoroughly cleaned and refurbished with new components as needed for redeployment 
unusable parts are scrapped 
refurbished systems are transferred from inventory to the gaming systems account and depreciated over their estimated useful life in a manner consistent with new gaming systems described above 
in addition  when our products have been delivered but the revenue associated with the arrangement has been deferred  we transfer the balance from inventory to gaming systems 
this balance is then charged to cost of revenue as the related deferred revenue is recognized 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
estimated useful lives are generally three to five years for gaming systems and five years for internal use equipment and office furniture 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
we evaluate property and equipment for impairment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value 
further  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods 
share based compensation we value our stock options issued based upon the black scholes option pricing model and recognize the compensation over the period in which the options vest 
we value restricted and unrestricted share grants and restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the shares at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the period in which the shares vest 
there are inherent estimates made by management regarding the calculation of stock option expense  including volatility  expected life and forfeiture rate 
see note shareholders equity stock incentive plans 
we recognize compensation expense for options  shares and units that vest over time using the straight line attribution approach 
for performance based options and shares issued to third parties  compensation expense is determined at each reporting date in accordance with the fair value method 
until the measurement date is reached  the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain 
compensation expense is recorded based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date and then revalued  or the total compensation is recalculated  based on the current fair value at each subsequent reporting date 
recent accounting pronouncements at december   there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact to our financial statements 
fair value measurements at the beginning of  we adopted an asu issued in january requiring separate disclosure of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements of fair value instruments within the level reconciliation 
additionally  we adopted an asu issued in may amending fair value measurements for us gaap and ifrs convergence 
the adoption of these asus did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards or updates presentation of other comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued an asu on presentation of comprehensive income to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
this update changes the requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income  eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity  among other items 
the guidance requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we adopted this asu for our first quarter of fiscal our total comprehensive income was comprised solely of net income for all periods presented 
accordingly  the adoption of this asu did not affect the presentation of our financial statements 
qualitative impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles in september  the fasb issued an asu to simplify the annual goodwill impairment test by allowing an entity to first assess qualitative factors  considering the totality of events and circumstances  to determine that there is a greater than likelihood that the carrying amount of a reporting unit is less than its fair value 
if so  then the two step impairment test is not required 
in july  the fasb issued an asu to simplify the impairment testing for other indefinite lived intangibles in a similar fashion 
both asus will be effective for our first quarter and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
offsetting assets and liabilities in december  the fasb issued an asu to require new disclosures associated with offsetting financial instruments and derivative instruments on the balance sheet that will enable users to evaluate the effect on an entity s financial position 
this asu will be effective for our first quarter and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from both changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
a discussion of our primary market risks is presented below cash and investments 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation  or trading purposes 
fixed rate debt 
as market interest rates fluctuate  the fair value of the fixed rate founders loan will also fluctuate 
the estimated fair value of the founders loan as of december  was  we estimate a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value by approximately  these changes would impact the fair value disclosures for this financial instrument  but would have no impact on interest expense paid or recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
variable rate debt 
our svb credit facility bears interest at variable rates based on spreads over the prime rate 
as of december   availability was  with no borrowings outstanding 
a change in average interest rates would not have had a significant effect on net interest expense during  as there were no balances outstanding under the svb credit facility 
as of december   the carrying value of our variable rate debt instruments approximated fair value 
the svb credit facility amended as of march  see debt financings credit facility in item above 
foreign currency risk 
our revenues from international customers and our inventory costs from international suppliers are exposed to the potentially adverse effects of currency exchange rates  local economic conditions  political instability and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
to the extent that our revenues and purchases from international business partners increase in the future  our exposure to changes in foreign economic conditions and currency fluctuations will increase 
our dependence on foreign customers and suppliers means  in part  that we are affected by changes in the relative value of the us dollar to foreign currencies  particularly the euro  canadian dollar  mexican peso  chinese rmb  and taiwan dollar 
although receipts from foreign customers and our purchases of foreign products are principally negotiated and paid for in us dollars  as our business becomes more international  payments denominated in foreign currencies may increase in the future 
in addition  changes in the applicable currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of our customers and vendors 
this  in turn  might cause such vendors to demand higher prices  delay shipments or discontinue selling to us 
this also might cause such customers to demand lower prices  delay or discontinue purchases of our products or demand other changes to the terms of our relationships 
these situations could in turn ultimately reduce our revenues or increase our costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes or engage in any other hedging strategies with regard to our foreign currency risk
