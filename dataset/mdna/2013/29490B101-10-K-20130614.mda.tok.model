overview we are the parent corporation of the following five subsidiaries delta biologicals  srl  diamedix corporation  drew scientific  inc  immunovision  inc  and jas diagnostics  inc through these subsidiaries  we develop  manufacture and market diagnostic test kits  or assays  and automated systems that are used to aid in the detection of disease markers primarily in the areas of autoimmune  infectious diseases  clinical chemistry  hematology and diabetes testing 
in addition to diagnostic kits  we also design and manufacture laboratory instruments that perform the tests and provide fast and accurate results  while reducing labor costs 
we also develop  manufacture and market raw materials  such as antigens used in the production of diagnostic kits 
our management reviews financial information  allocates resources and manages the business as two segments defined by geographic region 
one segment the domestic region contains diamedix  immunovision  drew scientific and jas diagnostics  our subsidiaries located in the united states and corporate operations 
our other segment the european region contains delta biologicals  our subsidiary located in italy 
the operations of drew scientific in the united kingdom are not material to our consolidated operations for the year ended december  acquisition of drew scientific  inc 
on october   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of drew scientific from a subsidiary of escalon medical corp 
pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between  among others  us and escalon 
included in the acquired businesses were drew scientific s wholly owned subsidiaries jas diagnostics  inc and drew scientific limited co 
for further details of this acquisition  see also note  acquisition of drew scientific  inc  to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquired businesses  collectively referred to as drew scientific  were acquired with the purpose of integrating drew scientific s manufacturing and distribution capabilities with our legacy operations in an effort to achieve economies of scale and maximize the utilization of our assets and facilities 
we paid  for all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of drew scientific  which purchase price was funded through the purchase by erba mannheim from us of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  drew scientific operates in the healthcare industry as a diagnostics company specializing in the design  manufacture and distribution of instruments for blood cell counting and blood analysis  focused on providing instrumentation and consumables for physician offices and veterinary office laboratories 
certain drew scientific subsidiaries also supply the reagent and other consumable materials needed to operate the instruments and manufacture a broad range of liquid stable  diagnostics chemistry reagents used in diabetes testing

in addition  the domestic provision of  for represents an estimated charge for expected future expenditure to resolve a state tax matter 
the deferred tax provisions in these years relate to domestic tax deductible goodwill 
no current tax benefit was recorded during the two years on our losses because we had a full valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets 
during  our wholly owned subsidiary in italy  delta biologicals  srl  eliminated the balance of its intercompany loan of approximately  due to us  as a result of converting the loan to capital equity 
we had accrued for a potential withholding tax that would have been due upon payment of the interest on the loan 
with the conversion of the balance to equity  approximately  of withholding tax liability was relieved during  as the accrued interest will not be paid and therefore no withholding tax should be accrued

cash used in operating activities of  during was the result of the net loss of  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of  partially offset by non cash items of  the non cash items include principally depreciation and amortization  adjustments to both the allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence and deferred income taxes 
investing activities as noted above and throughout this annual report on form k  we acquired drew scientific on october  as discussed in note  acquisition of drew scientific  inc  to the consolidated financial statements  the fair value of assets acquired aggregated  including accounts receivable of  inventory of  identifiable intangible assets of  other assets of  and goodwill of  the fair value of liabilities assumed aggregated  net cash of  and  was used in investing activities during and  respectively 
the cash flows relating to investing activities in were principally for the acquisition of drew scientific  net of cash acquired of  capital expenditures of  acquisition of equipment on lease of  offset by cash released from restricted deposits of  the cash flows relating to investing activities in were principally for capital expenditures including the upgrade of our information technology infrastructure in the united states and acquisition of equipment on lease  offset by cash released from restricted deposits 
financing activities financing activities during reflect the receipt of proceeds of  from the issuances of common stock  net proceeds of  under the line of credit and capital lease payments of  in april  we received  from erba mannheim in connection with its partial exercise of the warrant 
in september  we received  from erba mannheim as an advance in connection with our issuance in october of shares to it under the stock purchase agreement  as amended  between us and erba mannheim 
we used the proceeds from this advance to acquire  on october   drew scientific and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
financing activities during reflect the consummation of two significant financing arrangements the line of credit under the loan agreement  under which we drew down  as of december   and the investment by erba mannheim under the stock purchase agreement  resulting in our receipt of net proceeds after expenses of  related to the offering of  in  we also incurred capital lease payments of  and bank financing costs of  
table of contents other matters liquidity is expected to be sufficient for the next twelve months from the combination of the existing cash and cash equivalents at december   and the investment that erba mannheim has agreed to make under the stock purchase agreement  including the warrant  as described throughout this annual report on form k 
a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents is presently held at one international securities brokerage firm 
accordingly  we are subject to credit risk if this brokerage firm is unable to repay the balance in the account or deliver our securities or if the brokerage firm should become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent 
we invest in only select money market instruments  united states treasury investments  municipal and other governmental agency securities and corporate issuers 
our product research and development expenditures were  during the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  delta biologicals entered into a contract research and development agreement  as amended  with erba mannheim for a total of euro  equivalent to approximately 
totals of euro  equivalent to approximately  and euro  equivalent to approximately  were invoiced under the contract in the fourth quarter of and the year ended december   respectively 
actual expenditures will depend upon  among other things  the outcome of clinical testing of products under development  delays or changes in government required testing and approval procedures  technological and competitive developments  strategic marketing decisions and liquidity 
there can be no assurance that these expenditures will result in the development of new products or product enhancements  which we will successfully complete products under development  that we will obtain regulatory approval or that any approved product will be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed 
in connection with our evaluation of our operating results  financial condition and cash position  and specifically considering our results of operations and cash utilization during  we continue to implement measures expected to improve future cash flow 
to this end  we expect operating results to continue to improve from the operating results achieved during based principally upon increases in revenue as a result of new channels of distribution in the united states and international markets 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  particularly in italy where payment cycles are longer than in the united states  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required or timely payments 
additionally  we periodically receive payments based upon negotiated agreements with governmental regions in italy  acting on behalf of hospitals located in the region  in satisfaction of previously outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we may anticipate collection of these amounts through a payment as described above  and  therefore  not provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for these amounts 
if contemplated payments are not received  if existing agreements are not complied with or cancelled  or if we require additional allowances  then our operating results could be materially adversely affected during the period in which we make the determination to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we cannot guarantee that we can generate net income  increase revenues  improve our cash flow or successfully obtain debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  or at all  and  if we cannot do so  then we may not be able to survive and any investment in our company may be lost 
for the long term  we intend to utilize principally existing cash and cash equivalents  proceeds we expect to receive from erba mannheim pursuant to the investment contemplated by the stock purchase agreement  including the warrant  as well as internally generated funds  which are anticipated to be derived primarily from the sale of existing diagnostic and instrumentation products and diagnostic and instrumentation products currently under development as well as possible sources of debt and equity financings 
if we are not successful in improving our operating results and cash flows or if existing and possible future sources of liquidity described above are insufficient  then we may be required to curtail or reduce our operations 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  stock compensation  income and other tax accruals  the realization of long lived assets and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our assumptions and estimates may  however  prove to have been incorrect and our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the judgments and estimates we make concerning their application have significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies discussed below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition a principal source of revenue is our reagent rental program in which customers make reagent kit purchase commitments with us that will usually last for a period of three to five years 
in exchange  we typically include an instrument system  which remains our property or  in the case of a lease financing arrangement  that of the financing company 
we also include any required instrument service 
both the instrumentation and service are paid for by the customer through these reagent kit purchases over the life of the commitment 
we recognize revenue from the reagent kit sales when title passes  which is generally at the time of shipment 
should actual reagent kit or instrument failure rates significantly increase  our future operating results could be negatively impacted by increased warranty obligations and service delivery costs 
we recognize milestone payments when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator  provided that the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process  the milestone payment is non refundable and our past research and development services  as well as our ongoing commitment to provide research and development services under the collaboration  are charged at fees that are comparable to the fees that we customarily charge for similar research and development services 
during the year ended december   one of our subsidiaries entered into a contract research and development agreement with erba mannheim  as amended 
expenses incurred pursuant to that contract are included in cost of sales as the related revenues are recorded from the achievement of milestones 
allowance for doubtful accounts we grant credit without collateral to our customers based on our evaluation of a particular customer s credit worthiness 
in addition  allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained  particularly in italy where payment cycles are longer than in the united states and in some instances may take in excess of a year to collect  for potential credit losses based on the age of the accounts receivable and the results of our periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  particularly in italy for the operations of our european subsidiary  for estimated losses based on historical loss percentages resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand  which include components for current or future versions of products and instrumentation 
if necessary  we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimates of component obsolescence  product demand and production requirements  as well as based upon the status of a product within the regulatory approval process 
in accordance with our inventory 
table of contents accounting policy  our inventory balance as of december  included components for current or future versions of products and instrumentation 
our inventory balance as of december  and december  included approximately  of inventory relating to our hepatitis product  substantially all of which has a shelf life exceeding five years  for which we obtained ce marking approval in the european union during and which we have begun marketing in certain markets 
inventory reserves were  and  as of december  and december   respectively 
goodwill and other intangibles the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based upon our short term and long term projections for the company 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  including profit margins  long term forecasts  discount rates and terminal growth rates  reflect our best estimates 
although we consider our current market capitalization  we do not believe it to be an appropriate measure for the fair value of immunovision  as immunovision represents less than of our net revenues and total assets  and we believe that it is more meaningful to compute fair value based primarily upon discounted cash flows 
however  the continued decline in our market capitalization could also potentially require us to record additional impairment charges in future years for the remaining  of goodwill at immunovision 
our product license is existing technology  obtained from an italian diagnostics company that had developed and successfully commercialized this technology to manufacture hepatitis products sold by them and for which it had already received ce marking approval from the european union 
through the acquisition of this existing technology in its current form  we expect to be able to derive revenue from the manufacture and sale of new hepatitis products 
in exchange for the italian diagnostics company s assistance in transferring the know how of the manufacturing technology  we agreed to pay a total of  euros in the form of four milestone payments upon the italian diagnostics company s achievement of certain enumerated performance objectives related to the transfer of such existing technology 
we made the first three milestone payments of  euros upon the achievement of the enumerated performance objectives in prior years 
during the year ended december   the balance of  euro equivalent to approximately  was offset against the accounts receivable owed to us from the italian diagnostics company 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying amount of the product license was in excess of its fair value and recorded a non cash impairment charge to operations totaling  reducing the carrying value of the product license to  as of december   from  as of december  during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying amount of the product license was in excess of its fair value and recorded a non cash impairment charge to operations totaling  reducing the carrying value of the product license to  as of december  fair value was determined based upon the income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows 
based upon amended regulatory standards adopted by the applicable notifying body during the fourth quarter of to obtain ce marking and additional requirements specified during by the applicable notifying body  we revised our assumptions supporting our computation of discounted cash flows to reflect the further delay in product launch and the possibility of a decrease in projected market share as a result of this delay  as well as to estimate the impact of the current global economic conditions 
based upon this methodology  estimated future cash flows generated by the technology granted by the product license was then calculated  reflecting our best estimate of fair value 
while we obtained ce marking during  there remains a risk that we will not be able to market or manufacture our own hepatitis products 
while we believe that we will be able to bring these hepatitis kits to market  if the progress of our efforts to begin marketing these kits is adversely impacted  then we may be required to record an additional impairment charge with respect to all or a portion of the remaining carrying value of  stock based compensation stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards is based on the grant date fair value estimate calculated in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
we recognize these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service year of the award  which is generally the option vesting term of either immediately or in equal annual amounts over a four year period 

table of contents valuations are based on highly subjective assumptions about the future  including stock price volatility and exercise patterns 
the fair value of share based payment awards was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate expected term  taking into account option exercise and employee terminations 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for years within the expected life of the option is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
income taxes we have experienced net losses from our operations 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with these losses if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize the net operating loss to offset future taxes 
due to the cumulative net losses from the operations of both our domestic and european operations  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  over time we may reach levels of profitability that could cause our management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences 
upon reaching such a conclusion  and upon such time as we reverse the entire amount or a portion of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset  we would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our effective tax rate 
under section of the internal revenue code  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited in the future as a result of the september  acquisition by erba mannheim of the approximately of the then outstanding shares of our common stock previously owned by the debregeas kennedy group 
as a result of that acquisition  our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income is currently limited to approximately  per year  plus both any limitation unused since the acquisition and any unused net operating losses generated after the september  acquisition date 
the amount of the annual limitation will be adjusted upwards for any recognized built in gains on certain assets sold during the five year period commencing with the september  ownership change  but may be further limited in the event of any future change in control or similar transaction 
our results for the years ended december  and were not impacted by these limitations

table of contents recently issued accounting standards refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  under the heading  recently issued accounting standards  to the consolidated financial statements regarding recently issued accounting standards applicable to us 
currency fluctuations for the years december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we expect that this percentage may increase in the future as a result of our efforts to increase our international presence  particularly in key markets in europe  asia and south america 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar affect our reported results of operations 
if the united states dollar weakens relative to the foreign currency  then our earnings generated in the foreign currency will  in effect  increase when converted into united states dollars and vice versa 
exchange rate differences resulting from the relationship of the united states dollar against the euro resulted in a decrease of approximately  in net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our european subsidiary incurs most of its revenue and expenses in euro  which  to some extent  serves as a natural hedge and limits the net currency exposure 
during the years ended december  and  none of our subsidiaries was domiciled in a highly inflationary environment and the impact of inflation and changing prices on our net revenues and on our loss from continuing operations was not material 
conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties  risks  and uncertainties  such as export and trade restrictions  inconsistent and changing regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  cultural issues  labor and employment laws  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  local economic downturns  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe during the traditional summer vacation months and potentially adverse tax consequences 
income taxes refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements and the income taxes section of critical accounting policies included in this annual report on form k regarding income tax matters 
risk of product liability claims developing  manufacturing and marketing diagnostic test kits  reagents and instruments subject us to the risk of product liability claims 
we believe that we continue to maintain an adequate amount of product liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all existing and future claims 
there can be no assurance that claims arising under any pending or future product liability cases  whether or not covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our current products liability insurance is a claims made policy
