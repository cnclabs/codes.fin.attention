table of contents year ended december  in thousands other non gaap financial data ebitda adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitdar ebitda  ebitdar  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar are supplemental non gaap financial measures 
regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other provisions of the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
we calculate ebitda as net income  adjusted for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest  before a interest expense  net  b provision for income taxes  and c depreciation and amortization 
we calculate ebitdar by adjusting ebitda to exclude facility rent cost of services 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
we believe ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitdar and adjusted ebitdar are useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because they are widely used by investors and analysts in our industry as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry without regard to items such as interest expense  net and depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  and they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
we use ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitdar and adjusted ebitdar as measurements of our operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  and to compare our operating performance to that of our competitors 
we typically use ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitdar and adjusted ebitdar to compare the operating performance of each operation 
ebitda and ebitdar are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  and  with respect to ebitdar  facility rent cost of services  which may vary from period to period depending upon various factors  including the method used to finance facilities  the amount of debt that we have incurred  whether a facility is owned or leased  the date of acquisition of a facility or business  and the tax law of the state in which a business unit operates 
as a result  we believe that the use of ebitda and ebitdar provide a meaningful and consistent comparison of our business between periods by eliminating certain items required by gaap 
we also establish compensation programs and bonuses for our leaders that are partially based upon the achievement of adjusted ebitdar targets 
despite the importance of these measures in analyzing our underlying business  designing incentive compensation and for our goal setting  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitdar and adjusted ebitdar are non gaap financial measures that have no standardized meaning defined by gaap 
therefore  our ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitdar and adjusted ebitdar measures have limitations as analytical tools  and they should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our current or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  
table of contents they do not reflect the net interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  they do not reflect any income tax payments we may be required to make  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and ebitdar do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do  which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by using them only to supplement net income on a basis prepared in accordance with gaap in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
because these non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names 
for information about our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap  see our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document

see further discussion of acquisitions in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents key performance indicators we manage our skilled nursing business by monitoring key performance indicators that affect our financial performance 
these indicators and their definitions include the following routine revenue routine revenue is generated by the contracted daily rate charged for all contractually inclusive skilled nursing services 
the inclusion of therapy and other ancillary treatments varies by payor source and by contract 
services provided outside of the routine contractual agreement are recorded separately as ancillary revenue  including medicare part b therapy services  and are not included in the routine revenue definition 
skilled revenue the amount of routine revenue generated from patients in our skilled nursing facilities who are receiving higher levels of care under medicare  managed care  medicaid  or other skilled reimbursement programs 
the other skilled residents that are included in this population represent very high acuity residents who are receiving high levels of nursing and ancillary services which are reimbursed by payors other than medicare or managed care 
skilled revenue excludes any revenue generated from our assisted living services 
skilled mix the amount of our skilled revenue as a percentage of our total routine revenue 
skilled mix in days represents the number of days our medicare  managed care  or other skilled patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients less days from assisted living services from all payor sources are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities for any given period less days from assisted living services 
quality mix the amount of routine non medicaid revenue as a percentage of our total routine revenue 
quality mix in days represents the number of days our non medicaid patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients from all payor sources are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities for any given period less days from assisted living services 
average daily rates the routine revenue by payor source for a period at our skilled nursing facilities divided by actual patient days for that revenue source for that given period 
occupancy percentage operational beds the total number of residents occupying a bed in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility as a percentage of the beds in a facility which are available for occupancy during the measurement period 
number of facilities and operational beds the total number of skilled nursing  assisted living and independent living facilities that we own or operate and the total number of operational beds associated with these facilities 
skilled and quality mix 
like most skilled nursing providers  we measure both patient days and revenue by payor 
medicare  managed care and other skilled patients  whom we refer to as high acuity patients  typically require a higher level of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care 
accordingly  medicare and managed care reimbursement rates are typically higher than from other payors 
in most states  medicaid reimbursement rates are generally the lowest of all payor types 
changes in the payor mix can significantly affect our revenue and profitability 
the following table summarizes our overall skilled mix and quality mix for the periods indicated as a percentage of our total routine revenue less revenue from assisted living services and as a percentage of total patient days less days from assisted living services year ended december  skilled mix days revenue quality mix days revenue 
table of contents occupancy 
we define occupancy as the ratio of actual patient days one patient day equals one resident occupying one bed for one day during any measurement period to the number of beds in facilities which are available for occupancy during the measurement period 
the number of licensed and independent living beds in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility that are actually operational and available for occupancy may be less than the total official licensed bed capacity 
this sometimes occurs due to the permanent dedication of bed space to alternative purposes  such as enhanced therapy treatment space or other desirable uses calculated to improve service offerings and or operational efficiencies in a facility 
in some cases  three and four bed wards have been reduced to two bed rooms for resident comfort  and larger wards have been reduced to conform to changes in medicare requirements 
these beds are seldom expected to be placed back into service 
we define occupancy in operational beds as the ratio of actual patient days during any measurement period to the number of available patient days for that period 
we believe that reporting occupancy based on operational beds is consistent with industry practices and provides a more useful measure of actual occupancy performance from period to period 
the following table summarizes our overall occupancy statistics for the periods indicated year ended december  occupancy operational beds at end of period available patient days actual patient days occupancy percentage based on operational beds revenue sources our total revenue represents revenue derived primarily from providing services to patients and residents of skilled nursing facilities  and to a lesser extent from assisted living facilities and ancillary services 
we receive service revenue from medicaid  medicare  private payors and other third party payors  and managed care sources 
the sources and amounts of our revenue are determined by a number of factors  including bed capacity and occupancy rates of our healthcare facilities  the mix of patients at our facilities and the rates of reimbursement among payors 
payment for ancillary services varies based upon the service provided and the type of payor 
the following table sets forth our total revenue by payor source and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue medicaid custodial medicare medicaid skilled total managed care private and other payors total revenue private and other payors includes revenue from urgent care centers and franchising businesses 

table of contents primary components of expense cost of services exclusive of facility rent and depreciation and amortization shown separately 
our cost of services represents the costs of operating our facilities and primarily consists of payroll and related benefits  supplies  purchased services  and ancillary expenses such as the cost of pharmacy and therapy services provided to residents 
cost of services also includes the cost of general and professional liability insurance and other general cost of services with respect to our operations 
facility rent cost of services 
facility rent cost of services consists solely of base minimum rent amounts payable under lease agreements to third party owners of the facilities that we operate but do not own and does not include taxes  insurance  impounds  capital reserves or other charges payable under the applicable lease agreements 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and related benefits and travel expenses for our service center personnel  including training and other operational support 
general and administrative expense also includes professional fees including accounting and legal fees  costs relating to our information systems  stock based compensation and rent for our service center office 
depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are recorded at their original historical cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
the following is a summary of the depreciable lives of our depreciable assets buildings and improvements generally to years leasehold improvements shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life  generally to years furniture and equipment to years critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis we review our judgments and estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  income taxes  stock compensation  intangible assets and loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments upon our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b require management most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four conditions have been met i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue is derived primarily from providing healthcare services to residents and is recognized on the date services are provided at amounts billable to individual residents 
for residents under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including medicaid  medicare and private insurers  revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon amounts on a per patient  daily basis 
revenue from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we record revenue from these governmental and managed care programs as services are performed at their expected net realizable amounts under these programs 
our revenue from governmental and managed care programs is subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by governmental and third party agencies 
consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices  any changes to these governmental revenue estimates are recorded in the period the change or adjustment becomes known based on final settlement 
we recorded retroactive adjustments that increased decreased revenue by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents our service specific revenue recognition policies are as follows skilled nursing revenue our revenue is derived primarily from providing long term healthcare services to residents and is recognized on the date services are provided at amounts billable to individual residents 
for residents under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including medicaid  medicare and private insurers  revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon amounts on a per patient  daily basis 
we record revenue from private pay patients  at the agreed upon rate  as services are performed 
home health and hospice revenue recognition episodic based revenue net service revenue is typically recorded on a day episode payment rate 
we make adjustments to revenue on completed episodes to reflect differences between estimated and actual payment amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we record an estimate for the impact of such payment adjustments based on its historical experience 
in addition to revenue recognized on completed episodes  we also recognize a portion of revenue associated with episodes in progress 
episodes in progress are day episodes of care that begin during the reporting period  but were not completed as of the end of the period 
we estimate this revenue on a monthly basis 
the primary factors underlying this estimate are the number of episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period and expected medicare revenue per episode 
non episodic based revenue revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
hospice revenue revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates 
the estimated payment rates are daily rates for each of the levels of care we deliver 
we make adjustments to revenue for an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
additionally  as medicare hospice revenue is subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap  we monitor our provider numbers and estimates amounts due back to medicare if a cap has been exceeded 
we record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and increases other accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans and private payor sources 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type and the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors 
on an annual basis  the historical collection percentages are reviewed by payor and by state and are updated to reflect our recent collection experiences 
in order to determine the appropriate reserve rate percentages which ultimately establish the allowance  we analyze historical cash collection patterns by payor and by state 
the percentages applied to the aged receivable balances are based on our historical experience and time limits  if any  for managed care  medicare  medicaid and other payors 
we periodically refine our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on experience with the estimation process and changes in circumstances 
self insurance we are partially self insured for general and professional liability up to a base amount per claim the self insured retention with an aggregate  one time deductible above this limit 
losses beyond these amounts are insured through third party policies with coverage limits per occurrence  per location and on an aggregate basis 
for claims made after april   the combined self insured retention was million per claim with an aggregate million deductible limit 
for all facilities  except those located in colorado  the third party coverage above these limits was million per occurrence  million per facility  with a million blanket aggregate and an additional state specific aggregate where required by state law 
in colorado  the third party coverage above these limits was million per occurrence and million per facility  which is independent of the million blanket aggregate applicable to our other facilities 
the self insured retention and deductible limits for general and professional liability and workers compensation are self insured through the captive  the related assets and liabilities of which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the captive is subject to certain statutory requirements as an insurance provider 
these requirements include  but are not limited to  maintaining statutory capital 
our policy is to accrue amounts equal to the actuarially estimated costs to settle open claims of insureds  as well as an estimate of the cost of insured claims that have been incurred but not reported 
we develop 
table of contents information about the size of the ultimate claims based on historical experience  current industry information and actuarial analysis  and evaluate the estimates for claim loss exposure on a quarterly basis 
in addition  in accordance with guidance provided by the financial accounting standards board fasb in august  we recorded an asset and equal liability in order to present the ultimate costs of malpractice claims and the anticipated insurance recoveries on a gross basis 
our operating subsidiaries are self insured for workers compensation liability in california 
to protect ourself against loss exposure in california with this policy  we have purchased individual stop loss insurance coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each claim 
in texas  the operating subsidiaries have elected non subscriber status for workers compensation claims and  effective february   we have purchased individual stop loss coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each claim 
our operating subsidiaries in other states have third party guaranteed cost coverage 
in california and texas  we accrue amounts equal to the estimated costs to settle open claims  as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
we use actuarial valuations to estimate the liability based on historical experience and industry information 
we provide self insured medical including prescription drugs and dental healthcare benefits to the majority of our employees 
we are fully liable for all financial and legal aspects of these benefit plans 
to protect ourself against loss exposure with this policy  we have purchased individual stop loss insurance coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each covered person with an aggregate individual stop loss deductible of approximately million 
we believe that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care  workers compensation  healthcare benefits and related services provided to date 
the amount of our reserves was determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data 
this estimation process requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of the claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about emerging trends  we  with the assistance of an independent actuary  develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on our historical experience and other available industry information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle or pay damage awards with respect to unpaid claims 
the self insured liabilities are based upon estimates  and while management believes that the estimates of loss are reasonable  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the recorded amounts 
due to the inherent volatility of actuarially determined loss estimates  it is reasonably possible that we could experience changes in estimated losses that could be material to net income 
if our actual liability exceeds our estimates of loss  its future earnings  cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates in effect when such temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we generally expect to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  however  when necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when we take uncertain income tax positions that do not meet the recognition criteria  we record a liability for underpayment of income taxes and related interest and penalties  if any 
in considering the need for and magnitude of a liability for such positions  we must consider the potential outcomes from a review of the positions by the taxing authorities 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the annual income tax rate  or the need for and magnitude of liabilities for uncertain tax positions  we make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with knowledge and expertise in certain fields 
due to certain risks associated with our estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ 
noncontrolling interest the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is initially recognized at estimated fair value on the acquisition date and is presented within total equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
we present the noncontrolling interest and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the ensign group  inc in our consolidated statements of income and net income per share is calculated based on net income attributable to the ensign group  inc stockholders 
the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted based on an allocation of subsidiary earnings based on ownership interest 

table of contents derivatives and hedging activities we evaluate variable and fixed interest rate risk exposure on a routine basis and to the extent we believe that it is appropriate  we will offset most of our variable risk exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
it is our policy to only utilize derivative instruments for hedging purposes ie not for speculation 
we formally designate our interest rate swap agreements as hedges and documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items 
we formally assess effectiveness of our hedging relationships  both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis  then measures and records ineffectiveness 
we would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively i if it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting change in the cash flows of a hedged item  ii when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  iii if it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  or iv if management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate

new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb amended its guidance on reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendment requires companies to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this amendment applies to all entities that issue financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap and that report items of other comprehensive income and is effective for public companies for interim periods beginning after december  we are evaluating the potential impact the adoption of this amendment could have on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb clarified that an advance fee from a continuing care retirement community resident should be classified as deferred revenue if the contract stipulates that this advance fee must be repaid when a room is reoccupied by a future resident and the refundable amount is limited to the proceeds from reoccupancy 
if the refundable amount is not limited to the proceeds from reoccupancy  the advance fee must be reported as a liability 
the above clarification is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december   however early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of this clarification will have a material effect on our financial statements 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb amended the guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment 
the amendment was issued in response to feedback on the amendments made to the goodwill impairment testing requirements by allowing an entity to perform a qualitative impairment assessment before proceeding to the two step impairment test 
under the amended guidance  an entity testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset 
although this amendment revises the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider in interim periods  it does not revise the requirements to test indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment and between annual tests if there is a change in events or circumstances 
this amendment is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   however  early adoption is permitted 
we adopted this amendment during our current fiscal year impairment analysis in the fourth quarter 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb indefinitely deferred the provisions that required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements 
during the deferral period  entities will still need to comply with the existing us gaap requirements for the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb amended its standards on how health care entities present revenue and bad debt expense 
under the new guidance  health care entities are required to present bad debt expense related to patient service revenue as a reduction of patient service revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts on the statement of income for entities that do not assess a patient ability to pay prior to rendering services 
further  it was determined  net presentation of bad debt expense in revenue would only apply to bad debts that are related to patient service revenue  to entities that provide services prior to assessing a patient ability to pay  or to entities that recognize revenue prior to deciding that collection is reasonably assured 
in addition  the final consensus requires health care entities to disclose information about the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts  such as recoveries and write offs  by using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data 
it will also require disclosure of our policies for i assessing the timing and amount of uncollectible revenue recognized as bad debt expense  and ii assessing 
table of contents collectability in the timing and amount of revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of this amendment during the first quarter of the current year 
we determined the requirements for presentation of bad debt expense related to patient service revenue as a reduction of patient service revenue outlined in the amendment is not applicable as we assess each patient ability to pay prior to rendering services

in january  the office of the inspector general of the united states department of health and human services hhs served the new subpoena  seeking specific patient records and documents from to from six southern california skilled nursing facilities that had been the subject of previous requests 
hhs also issued a subpoena to our independent external auditors requesting an update to the information requested in the subpoena to them  and a subpoena to the company independent internal auditors requesting similar information 
we  through the special committee and our outside counsel  continue to work cooperatively with the doj 
ensign anticipates that this ongoing dialogue will continue in as part of our effort to resolve the investigation and any qui tam whistleblower complaints that may have been filed 
based on information gathered by us in connection with the work of the special committee  the company outside counsel and their experts  we recorded an estimated liability in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of related to our efforts to achieve a global  company wide  resolution of any claims connected to the investigation 

table of contents active settlement discussions with the doj are ongoing and  until concluded  the outcome remains uncertain and the amount related to the resolution of any claims connected to this pending investigation could differ materially from our estimates 
at this time  we cannot estimate the possible range of loss that may result from any such proceedings or discussions 
see additional description of our contingencies in notes  and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the medicare program 
we also derive revenue from state medicaid and similar reimbursement programs 
payments under these programs generally provide for reimbursement levels that are adjusted for inflation annually based upon the state s fiscal year for the medicaid programs and in each october for the medicare program 
these adjustments may not continue in the future  and even if received  such adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in our costs for providing healthcare services 
labor and supply expenses make up a substantial portion of our cost of services 
those expenses can be subject to increase in periods of rising inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
to date  we have generally been able to implement cost control measures or obtain increases in reimbursement sufficient to offset increases in these expenses 
we may not be successful in offsetting future cost increases 
off balance sheet and other arrangements as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of borrowing capacity on the revolver pledged as collateral to secure outstanding letters of credit  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate changes in connection with the revolving credit facility portion of the senior credit facility  which is available but historically has not regularly been used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to balance the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and maintain a lower interest rate 
to achieve this objective  we have historically borrowed primarily at fixed rates  although the revolving credit facility portion of the senior credit facility is available and could be used for short term borrowing purposes 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of the senior credit facility of million 
the senior credit facility agreement exposes us to variability in interest payments due to changes in libor interest rates 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce risk from volatility in the income statement on the term loan portion of the senior credit facility 
the swap agreement  with a notional amount of million  amortizing concurrently with the related term loan portion of the senior credit facility  is five years in length and set to mature on july  under the terms of this agreement  the net effect of the hedge was to record swap interest expense at a fixed rate of approximately 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  consisted of bank term deposits  money market funds and us treasury bill related investments 
in addition  as of december   we held debt security investments of approximately million  which were split between aa and a rated securities 
our market risk exposure is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
due to the low risk profile of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the above only incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
if we diversify our investment portfolio into securities and other investment alternatives  we may face increased risk and exposures as a result of interest risk and the securities markets in general
