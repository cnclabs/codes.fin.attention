management overview blue nile is the leading online retailer of high quality diamonds and fine jewelry 
we offer our products for sale through the bluenile 
com website in over countries and territories throughout the world 
our primary focus is on growing our business by providing unparalleled value to consumers and delivering exceptional customer service 
our online business model allows us to avoid many of the costs that are typically incurred by physical retail stores 
as a result  we are able to realize lower gross profit margins while remaining profitable 
our lower gross profit margins result from lower retail prices that we offer to our customers 
we believe that our unique product selection  connection with our customers through our marketing and customer service efforts  and our competitive pricing will result in increasing our sales and market share 
our objective is to maximize our revenue and profitability and increase market share both domestically and internationally by offering exceptional value to our customers through a high quality customer experience that leverages supply chain efficiencies and an efficient cost structure 
we have established and will continue to refine our scalable  capital efficient business model that enables growth with lower working capital requirements than traditional store based jewelry retailers 
we focus on optimizing the cash flow dynamics of our business by managing inventory balances along with vendor payment terms 
over the longer term  our goal is to increase revenues  profit  and cash flow by leveraging our relatively low fixed cost technology and operations infrastructure as we achieve sales increases 
our long term financial focus is primarily on sustainable growth in free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure 
non gaap free cash flow is primarily driven by increasing our operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures 
increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our website  improvements in operating margins and the efficient management of operating costs  offset by the investments that we make in longer term strategic initiatives 
differentiating factors and value proposition our innovative business model is designed to deliver exceptional value and service to customers 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived through sales of engagement rings or jewelry products that feature a diamond 
we have developed relationships with a large number of diamond suppliers with whom we have exclusive agreements as an online retailer 
this allows us to offer our customers access to a large selection of high quality diamonds through our website that we do not hold in inventory 
in most cases  we purchase diamonds from our suppliers only as our customers place orders with us 
as a result  we do not incur the significant costs that would be incurred by physical retail stores to carry high levels of diamond inventory 
our efficient operating model also provides for negative working capital benefits  since payments are received from customers within a few days of shipment of their order  but our vendor payment terms are typically in the day range 
in addition to the working capital benefits of our model  the significant volume of diamonds that we purchase enhances our ability to buy from our suppliers at the best and lowest prices 
we are able to pass these lower costs on to consumers  further increasing our value proposition 
focus on growth in  we focused on accelerating the sales growth rate of our business through initiatives across three main categories the sale of engagement products in the us  the sale of non engagement products in the us  and the sale of both engagement and non engagement products in international markets 
we believe that value is one of the most important drivers of engagement sales  and the current costs of diamonds is a significant factor to our growth rate 
generally  we purchase our diamonds on a real time basis from our suppliers when a customer places an order for a specific diamond 
when the cost of diamonds is relatively steady or declines  we believe that our business benefits because we are able to immediately pass those lower costs on to consumers 
for the majority of  we benefited from a year over year decrease in the cost of diamonds 
these lower costs  along with our aggressive retail pricing  increases our value proposition compared to our bricks and mortar competitors  who are carrying diamond inventory that was purchased months earlier at higher costs 

table of contents to accelerate growth in our non engagement category  we concentrated our marketing efforts on acquiring new customers 
we also increased the breadth of products offered on our website to appeal to a greater number of customers 
the total addressable market for the sale of non engagement products is much greater than that for engagement  and we believe our brand is well positioned to attract new customers 
additionally  we believe that customers who purchase our non engagement products will return to place orders in the future at a higher cumulative value than those who initially purchased an engagement product 
the higher value of future purchases  coupled with relatively higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue than we earn selling our engagement products  creates a compelling opportunity for us to invest in this category for growth 
during  investments in the non engagement category increased our selling  general and administrative expenses and increased the amount of inventory we carried compared to the same period last year 
we believe that these investments will lead to increased growth in this category of our business and provide higher profitability over the long term 
as part of our plan to accelerate growth in our international business  we increased our investment in key areas to provide a greater localized experience in key countries 
this investment included expanded website functionality  increased product offerings  native language websites and customer service personnel  and other strategic investments 
additionally  the pricing dynamics of diamond supply on our engagement products apply to prices offered to our international customers increasing our value proposition compared to our competitors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make certain estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following are the critical accounting policies that we believe require significant estimation and management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and the related gross profit on the date on which ownership passes from blue nile to our customers 
for customers in the us  canada  us  and united arab emirates use  ownership passes at the time the package is received by the customer 
for customers in other locations  ownership passes at the time the product is shipped 
as we require customer payment prior to order shipment  any payments received prior to the transfer of ownership are not recorded as revenue 
for us  canadian  us  and us shipments  we utilize our freight vendors tracking information to determine when delivery has occurred  which is typically within one to three days after shipment 
we reduce revenue by a provision for returns  which is estimated based on our historical product return rates and current economic conditions 
our contracts with our suppliers generally allow us to return diamonds purchased and returned by our customers 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation at fair value 
we use the black scholes merton option valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term expected volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of employee stock options and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
we performed the following sensitivity analysis using changes in the expected term and expected volatility that could be reasonably possible in the near term 
if we assumed a six month increase or decrease in the expected term or a basis point increase or decrease in expected volatility  the value of a newly granted hypothetical stock option would increase decrease by the following percentages increase decrease expected term expected volatility sensitivity to change in assumptions was determined using the black scholes merton valuation model compared to the following original assumptions stock price and exercise price equal to the closing market price of blue nile  inc common 
table of contents stock on december   expected term of years  expected volatility of  expected dividend yield of and a risk free interest rate of 
in addition  we estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize stock based compensation expense for grants that are expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended december  year ended january  year ended january  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following describes certain items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations net sales 
substantially all of our net sales consist of diamonds and fine jewelry sold via the internet  net of estimated returns 
historically  net sales have been higher in the fourth quarter as a result of higher consumer spending during the holiday season 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
gross profit 
our gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold to customers  inbound and outbound shipping costs  depreciation on assembly related assets  insurance on shipments and the costs incurred to set diamonds into ring  earring and pendant settings  including labor and related facilities costs 
our gross profit has fluctuated historically and we expect it to continue to fluctuate based primarily on our product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefit costs for our employees  stock based compensation  marketing costs and credit card fees 
these expenses also include certain facility related costs  and fulfillment  customer service  technology and depreciation expenses  as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
fiscal year 
our fiscal year generally ends on the sunday closest to december each fiscal year consists of four week quarters  with one extra week added in the fourth quarter every five to six years 
our fiscal year included one extra week in the fourth quarter  or weeks for the fiscal year  as a result of our retail reporting calendar 
the following table presents our historical operating results  including a comparison of the financial results for the periods indicated dollars in thousands  except per share data

sales of our engagement products grew at a rate above our overall sales growth rate 
net sales in the us increased by to million for the fiscal year ended december  compared with million for the fiscal year ended january  us engagement net sales increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended january  we believe that sales growth was positively impacted by a year over year decrease in diamond costs that occurred throughout most of us non engagement net sales grew to million in the fiscal year ended december  from million in the fiscal year ended january  international net sales increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended january   due primarily to increased marketing efforts and expansion of our product assortment 
internally  we monitor our international sales performance on a non gaap basis which eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into us dollars constant exchange rate basis 
international net sales growth was negatively impacted by approximately due to changes in foreign exchange rates in compared with the rates in effect during excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  international sales increased in the year ended december  gross profit gross profit increased million or in the fiscal year ended december  compared with the fiscal year ended january  the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in the year ended december  compared with in the year ended january  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin is attributable to changes in our product mix 
our engagement products generally provide a lower gross margin than our non engagement products 
in the fiscal year ended december   sales of our engagement products grew faster than our non engagement products and equaled of our total revenue versus in the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents costs for our products are impacted by prices for diamonds and precious metals  including gold  platinum and silver  which rise and fall based upon global supply and demand dynamics 
in making retail pricing decisions  we take into account fluctuations in the pricing of diamonds and precious metals  which in turn  affect the gross margin that we realize from such products 
while prices for diamonds and precious metals will continue to fluctuate based upon supply and demand  we cannot adequately predict the amount and timing of any such fluctuations 
we expect that gross profit and gross margin will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product acquisition costs  particularly diamond prices  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended december  compared with million in the fiscal year ended january  due to several factors 
marketing and advertising costs increased approximately million  primarily due to increased spending on online marketing vehicles  promotional activities  and other marketing activities to drive new customer acquisition and increase brand awareness 
compensation and benefits expenses increased million due to increased headcount to support order growth  key business initiatives  and increased incentive bonus accruals 
payment processing fees increased approximately million in the fiscal year ended december  primarily due to higher sales volumes 
these expense increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in stock based compensation expense 
this decrease is primarily due to a lower number of options outstanding at lower option fair values in the fiscal year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended january  other income  net the increase in other income  net in the fiscal year ended december  as compared with the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to proceeds of approximately million from a favorable settlement related to the de beers anti trust litigation 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended december  was as compared with for the fiscal year ended january  the increase is primarily attributable to tax benefits received in fiscal year ended january  from stock option exercises that did not recur in fiscal year comparison of fiscal year ended january  to fiscal year ended january  net sales net sales increased in the fiscal year ended january   compared with the fiscal year ended january   due to an increase in the number of orders shipped to customers  partially offset by a decrease in the average shipment value 
sales of our non engagement jewelry grew at a rate above our overall sales growth rate 
net sales in the us increased by to million in compared with million in the prior year 
us non engagement net sales grew due to expansion of our product assortment that commenced in mid and increased marketing efforts 
us engagement net sales declined for the year  attributed to significant increases in diamond prices in the first half of that negatively impacted demand for our engagement products 
although diamond prices stabilized in the second half of  costs of certain of our more popular diamond sizes and shapes were to higher at january  than at january  international sales increased to million for the fiscal year ended january   compared with million for the fiscal year ended january   due primarily to increased marketing efforts 
the strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar also contributed to international sales growth 
international sales growth was positively impacted by approximately due to changes in foreign exchange rates in compared with the rates in effect during excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  international sales increased in the fiscal year ended january  gross profit 
table of contents gross profit increased million or in the fiscal year ended january  compared with the fiscal year ended january  the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in net sales 
gross margin decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  compared with in the year ended january  the decrease in gross margin is attributable to increases in diamond and precious metals costs and increased promotional activity 
as noted above  the cost of diamonds increased significantly in precious metals costs also increased significantly in these cost increases were not fully passed on to our customers  which lowered our gross margin percentages 
additionally  in order to spur sales  we increased our marketing promotions  which impacted net revenue and our gross margin percentage 
generally  we purchase our diamonds on a real time basis from our suppliers when a customer places an order for a specific diamond 
in periods of rapidly rising prices  the value that we are able to provide to customers and or our gross margin percent may decrease 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  compared with million in the fiscal year ended january  due to several factors 
marketing and advertising costs increased million  primarily due to increased spending on online marketing vehicles  public relations  promotional activities such as daily deals  and other marketing activities to drive new customer acquisition and increase brand awareness 
compensation and benefits expenses increased million due to increased headcount to support key business initiatives  partially offset by lower year over year incentive bonus accruals 
building rent increased million due to increased rent expense for our new corporate office location 
depreciation expense related to additional capitalized assets added approximately million to expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the fiscal year ended january  compared to for the fiscal year ended january  other income  net the increase in other income  net resulted from higher interest income for the fiscal year ended january  as compared with the fiscal year ended january  primarily due to higher average interest rates and  to a lesser extent  higher overall cash balances 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended january  was as compared with for the fiscal year ended january  liquidity and capital resources we are primarily funded by our cash flows from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our business model provides certain beneficial working capital characteristics 
while we collect cash from sales to customers within several business days of the related sale  we typically have extended payment terms with our suppliers 
our liquidity is primarily dependent upon our net cash from operating activities 
our net cash from operating activities is sensitive to many factors  including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of expenditures 
working capital at any specific point in time is dependent upon many variables  including our operating results  seasonality  inventory management and assortment expansion  the timing of cash receipts and payments  and vendor payment terms 
at december   we had a working capital deficiency of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million and inventory of million  offset by accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling million 
current levels of cash and cash equivalents reflect the strategic decision to repurchase million of our common stock shares in the fiscal year ended december   resulting in the negative working capital 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a million unsecured  revolving credit facility the revolving loan 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and our ability to borrow under the revolving loan will be sufficient to continue our operations and meet our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
see discussion of the revolving loan in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million in the fiscal year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended december  was primarily attributable to lower net payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal the net increase in accounts payable totaled million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  we experience greater cash flow from operations in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due to the significant increase in revenue from our holiday sales 
in the first quarter we typically have a significant pay down of our accounts payable balance that was accumulated during the fourth quarter holiday season 
accounts payable increased more in the fourth quarter of due to higher sales in the quarter  compared to year over year sales declines that we experienced in the fourth quarter of additionally  cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended december  was negatively impacted by a million tax deficiency resulting from out of the money vested stock options that were unexercised 
this compares to a tax benefit of million in the fiscal year ended january  realized from option exercises 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the fiscal year ended january  compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended january  was primarily attributable to a decrease in working capital from inventory attributable to an increase in units from the expansion of our product line in as well as cost increases in the products that we hold for sale 
the net increase in trade payables totaled million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  trade payables did not increase as much in the fiscal year ended january  as in the fiscal year ended january  due to the working capital dynamics of our business model associated with the sales decline in the fourth quarter and the resulting slower than historical build up of accounts payable 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended january  was also attributable to lower net income and the decrease in tax benefits realized upon the exercise of stock options 
the net tax benefit realized from stock option exercises  which represent the tax deductions in excess of stock compensation expense recorded in the financial statements  decreased to million in the fiscal year ended january   from million in the fiscal year ended january  due to the number of stock options exercised and the market price of our common stock 
net cash of million was used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended december  net cash of million was used for purchases of property and equipment to support our operations 
net cash of million was used to purchase preferred shares in a privately held company and was loaned to the same privately held company in exchange for a note receivable 
net cash of million was used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended january  due to the purchase of property and equipment related primarily to our corporate office move in the second quarter of net cash of million was provided by investing activities in the fiscal year ended january  due to the maturity of million in short term investments  partially offset by purchases of million of property and equipment 
our capital needs are generally minimal and include investments in technology and website enhancements  capital improvements to our leased warehouse and office facilities  and furniture and equipment 
additionally  we have the ability to reduce and or delay capital investments in challenging economic conditions without significant disruption to our business or operations 
over the next months  we do not expect purchases of property and equipment to exceed our historic levels 
net cash of million was used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  related primarily to the repurchase of common stock 
during the fiscal year ended december  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
this was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
since the inception of our buyback programs in the first quarter of through december   we have repurchased approximately million shares for a total of million 
shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or in negotiated transactions off the market 
the timing and amount of any shares repurchased are determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
repurchases may also be made under a rule b plan 
we continually assess market conditions  our cash position  operating results  current forecasts and other factors when making decisions about stock repurchases 
net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended january  of million 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily related to the repurchase of common stock

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on liquidity and cash flows as of 
table of contents december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years over years operating leases financing obligation purchase obligations purchase obligations during  we made tenant improvements to our us fulfillment center 
due to our financial involvement in the construction of the leased property  we recorded the building as property and equipment during the construction period 
upon completion  the transaction did not meet the criteria for sale leaseback accounting  and accordingly  has been recorded as a long term financing obligation 
includes open merchandise purchase orders at december  includes commitments for advertising and marketing and other services at december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances  cash flow from operations and our ability to borrow under the revolving loan will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we currently do not have any outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
however  projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to many factors and to uncertainty 
we continually assess our capital structure and opportunities to obtain credit facilities  sell equity or debt securities  or undertake other transactions for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
however  there can be no assurance that additional equity  debt or other financing transactions will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes
