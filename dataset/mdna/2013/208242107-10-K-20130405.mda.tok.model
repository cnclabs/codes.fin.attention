item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below  as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form k 
if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form k were to materialize  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we may not be able to open and profitably operate new stores in existing  adjacent and new geographic markets 
we reinstated our new store opening program during fiscal year and opened five new stores 
we have plans to open to more new stores in fiscal year new stores may not be profitable on an operating basis during the first months after they open and even after that time period may not be profitable or meet our goals 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
there are a number of factors that could affect our ability to open and operate new stores consistent with our business plan  including difficulties associated with the hiring  training and retention of additional skilled personnel  including store managers  the availability of additional financial resources  the availability of favorable sites in existing  adjacent and new markets at price levels consistent with our business plan  competition in existing  adjacent and new markets  competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns in adjacent and new markets that are different from those in our existing markets  a lack of consumer demand for our products or financing programs at levels that can support new store growth  inability to make customer financing programs available that allow consumers to purchase products at levels that can support new store growth  limitations created by covenants and conditions under our revolving credit facility  the substantial commitment and outlay of financial resources required to open new stores and the possibility that we may recognize little or no related benefit  an inability or unwillingness of vendors to supply product on a timely basis at competitive prices  the failure to open enough stores in new markets to achieve a sufficient market presence and realize the benefits of leveraging our advertising and our distribution system  unfamiliarity with local real estate markets and demographics in adjacent and new markets  problems in adapting our distribution and other operational and management systems to an expanded network of stores  and higher costs for print  radio  television or internet advertising 
these factors may also affect the ability of any newly opened stores to achieve sales and profitability levels comparable with our existing stores or to become profitable at all 
as a result  we may determine that we need to close additional stores or reduce the hours of operation in some stores  which could materially adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows  as we may incur additional expenses and non cash write offs related to closing a store and settling our remaining lease obligations and our initial investment in fixed assets and related store costs 
we may not successfully implement our existing store remodeling program which could negatively impact our results of operations or fail to provide a favorable return on our investment 
we plan to remodel of our existing stores by the end of fiscal year  of which were completed as of january  these efforts may not be successful in enhancing the operating results of the stores remodeled  which could negatively affect our results of operations or may not yield a favorable return on the investment required for such remodels 
further  our store operations for such stores could be disrupted or such stores temporarily closed  which could negatively impact our financial performance 
if we are unable to successfully operate remodeled stores in our new store format or customers for those stores are not receptive to the new store format  our operating results for such stores would be negatively affected 
if we are unable to manage our growing business  our revenues may not increase as anticipated  our cost of operations may rise and our results of operations may decline 
as we grow our store base  we will face many business risks associated with growing companies  including the risk that our management  financial controls and information systems will be inadequate to support our expansion in the future 
our growth will require management to expend significant time and effort and additional resources to ensure the continuing adequacy of our financial controls  operating procedures  information systems  product purchasing  warehousing and distribution systems and employee training programs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to effectively manage these increased demands or respond on a timely basis to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management  financial controls and information systems 
if we fail to manage successfully the challenges of growth  do not continue to improve these systems and controls or encounter unexpected difficulties during expansion  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we may expand our retail offerings which may have different operating or legal requirements than our current operations 
in addition to the retail and consumer finance products we currently offer  we may offer other products and services in the future  including new financing products 
these products and services may require additional or different operating systems or have additional or different legal or regulatory requirements than the products and services we currently offer 
in the event we undertake such an expansion and do not have the proper infrastructure or personnel  or do not successfully execute such an expansion  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
a decrease in our credit sales or a decline in credit quality could lead to a decrease in our product sales and profitability 
in the last three fiscal years  we financed  on average  including down payments  approximately of our retail sales through our in house proprietary credit programs to customers with a broad range of credit worthiness 
a large portion of our credit portfolio is to customers considered by many to be subprime borrowers 
our ability to provide credit as a financing alternative for our customers depends on many factors  including the quality of our customer receivables portfolio 
payments on some of our credit accounts become delinquent from time to time  and some accounts end up in default  due to several factors  such as general and local economic conditions  including the impact of rising interest rates and unemployment rates 
as we continue to expand into new markets  we will obtain new credit accounts that may present a higher risk than our existing credit accounts since new credit customers do not have an established credit history with us 
a general decline in the quality of our customer receivable portfolio could lead to a reduction in the advance rates used or eligible customer receivable balances included in the borrowing base calculations under our revolving credit facility and thus a reduction of available credit to fund our finance operations 
as a result  if we are required to reduce the amount of credit we grant to our customers  we most likely would sell fewer products  which would adversely affect our financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
further  because approximately of our credit account payments received during fiscal were received in one of our store locations  any decrease in credit sales could reduce traffic in our stores and lower our revenues 
a decline in the credit quality of our credit accounts could also cause an increase in our credit losses  which would result in an adverse effect on our earnings 
a decline in credit quality could also lead to stricter underwriting criteria which would likely have a negative impact on net sales 
we have significant future capital needs and the inability to obtain funding for our credit operations may adversely affect our business and expansion plans 
as of january   we financed our customer receivables through an asset based loan facility that provided million in financing commitments and securitized notes 
we had million outstanding under our asset based revolving credit facility  including standby letters of credit issued as of january  our ability to raise additional capital through expansion of our asset based loan facility  future securitization transactions or other debt or equity transactions  and do so on economically favorable terms  depends in large part on factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include conditions in the securities and finance markets generally  our credit rating or the credit rating of any securities we may issue  economic conditions  conditions in the markets for securitized instruments  or other debt or equity instruments  the credit quality and performance of our customer receivables  our overall sales performance and profitability  our ability to provide or obtain financial support for required credit enhancement  our ability to adequately service our financial instruments  our ability to meet debt covenant requirements  and prevailing interest rates 

table of contents if adequate capital and funds are not available at the time we need capital  we will have to curtail future growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flow 
as we grow our business  capital expenditures during future years are likely to exceed our historical capital expenditures 
the ultimate amount of capital expenditures needed will be dependent on  among other factors  the availability of capital to fund new store openings and customer receivables portfolio growth 
in addition  we historically used our customer receivables as collateral to raise funds through securitization programs 
in fiscal year  we completed amendments to our existing credit facilities and our terminated securitization facilities to obtain relief from potential covenant violations and revise certain covenant requirements 
if we require amendments in the future and are unable to obtain such amendments or we are unable to arrange substitute financing facilities or other sources of capital  we may have to limit or cease offering credit through our finance programs due to our inability to draw under our revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of a default 
if availability under the borrowing base calculations of our revolving credit facility is reduced  or otherwise becomes unavailable  or we are unable to arrange substitute financing facilities or other sources of capital  we may have to limit the amount of credit that we make available through our customer finance programs 
a reduction in our ability to offer customer credit will adversely affect revenues and results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  our inability or limitations on our ability to obtain funding through securitization facilities or other sources may adversely affect our profitability under our credit programs if existing customers fail to repay outstanding credit due to our refusal to grant additional credit 
additionally  the inability of any of the financial institutions providing our financing facilities to fund their commitment would adversely affect our ability to fund our credit programs  capital expenditures and other general corporate needs 
if we are unable to renew or replace our existing credit facilities or securitized financing in the future or have access to securitization markets reduced  we would be required to reduce  or possibly cease  offering customers credit  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in the same manner as discussed above 
failure to comply with our covenants in our credit facilities could materially and adversely affect us 
under our existing asset based loan facility we have certain obligations  including maintaining certain financial covenants 
if we fail to maintain the financial covenants in our credit facility and are not able to obtain relief from any covenant violation  then an event of default could occur and the lenders could cease lending to us  accelerate the payments of our debt and foreclose on our assets that secure the asset based loan facility 
any such action by the lenders could materially and adversely affect us and could even result in bankruptcy 
while we are in compliance with the covenants in our existing facilities  if our retail and credit operation performance deteriorates  we could be in breach of one or more covenants 
increased borrowing costs will negatively impact our results of operations 
because most of our customer receivables have interest rates equal to the highest rate allowable under applicable law  we would not be able to pass higher borrowing costs along to our customers and our results of operations would be negatively impacted 
the interest rates on our revolving credit facility fluctuate up or down based upon the libor rate  the prime rate of our administrative agent or the federal funds rate 
the level of interest rates in the market in general will impact the interest rate on any debt instruments issued  if any 
additionally  we may issue debt securities or enter into credit facilities under which we pay interest at a higher rate than we have historically paid which would further reduce our margins and negatively impact our results of operations 
deterioration in the performance of our customer receivables portfolio could significantly affect our liquidity position and profitability 
our liquidity position and profitability are heavily dependent on our ability to collect our customer receivables 
if our customer receivables portfolio were to substantially deteriorate  the liquidity available to us would most likely be reduced due to the challenges of complying with the covenants and borrowing base calculations under our revolving credit facility and our earnings may decline due to higher provisions for bad debt expense  higher servicing costs  higher net charge off rates and lower interest and fee income 
our ability to collect from credit customers may be materially impaired by store closings and our need to rely on a replacement servicer in the event of our liquidation 
we may be unable to collect a large portion of periodic credit payments should our stores close as many of our customers remit payments in store 
during the course of fiscal year  approximately of our active credit customers made a payment in one of our stores 
in the event of store closings  credit customers may not pay balances in a timely fashion  or may not pay at all  since a large number of our customers have not traditionally made payments to a central location 
in addition  we service our active credit customers through our in house servicing operation 
at this time  there is not a formalized back up servicer plan in place for the vast majority of our customer receivables 
in the event of our liquidation  a servicing arrangement would have to be implemented  which could materially impact the collection of our customer receivables 

table of contents in deciding whether to extend credit to customers  we rely on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished to us by or on behalf of our credit customers 
if we and our systems are unable to detect any misrepresentations in this information  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in deciding whether to extend credit to customers  we rely heavily on information furnished to us by or on behalf of our credit customers and our ability to validate such information through third party services  including employment and personal financial information 
if a significant percentage of our credit customers intentionally or negligently misrepresent any of this information  and we or our systems did not detect such misrepresentations  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively manage our credit risk  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our policy of re aging certain delinquent borrowers affects our delinquency statistics and the timing and amount of our write offs 
as of january   of our credit portfolio consisted of re aged customer receivables 
re aging is offered to certain eligible past due customers if they meet the conditions of our re age policy 
our decision to offer a delinquent customer a re age program is based on that borrower s specific condition  our history with the borrower  the amount of the loan and various other factors 
when we re age a customer s account  we move the account from a delinquent status to a current status 
management exercises a considerable amount of discretion over the re aging process and has the ability to re age an account multiple times during its life 
during fiscal year  we implemented a policy to limit the number of months an account can be re aged over the life of the account to months 
treating an otherwise uncollectible account as current affects our delinquency statistics  as well as impacting the timing and amount of charge offs 
if these accounts had been charged off sooner  our net loss rates might have been higher 
if we fail to timely contact delinquent borrowers  then the number of delinquent customer receivables eventually being charged off could increase 
we contact customers with delinquent credit account balances soon after the account becomes delinquent 
during periods of increased delinquencies it is important that we are proactive in dealing with borrowers rather than simply allowing customer receivables to go to charge off 
historically  when our servicing becomes involved at an earlier stage of delinquency with credit counseling and workout programs  there is a greater likelihood that the customer receivable will not be charged off 
during periods of increased delinquencies  it becomes extremely important that we are properly staffed and trained to assist borrowers in bringing the delinquent balance current and ultimately avoiding charge off 
if we do not properly staff and train our collections personnel  then the number of accounts in a delinquent status or charged off could increase 
in addition  managing a substantially higher volume of delinquent customer receivables typically increases our operational costs 
a rise in delinquencies or charge offs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
we rely on internal models to manage risk and to provide accounting estimates 
our results could be adversely affected if those models do not provide reliable accounting estimates or predictions of future activity 
we make significant use of business and financial models in connection with our efforts to measure and monitor our risk exposures and to manage our credit portfolio 
for example  we use models as a basis for credit underwriting decisions  portfolio delinquency  charge off and collection expectations and other market risks  based on economic factors and our experience 
the information provided by these models is used in making business decisions relating to strategies  initiatives  transactions and pricing  as well as the size of our allowance for doubtful accounts  among other accounting estimates 
models are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on current and historical data available to us and our assumptions about factors such as credit demand  payment rates  default rates  delinquency rates and other factors that may overstate or understate future experience 
our models could produce unreliable results for a number of reasons  including the limitations of historical data to predict results due to unprecedented events or circumstances  invalid or incorrect assumptions underlying the models  the need for manual adjustments in response to rapid changes in economic conditions  changes in credit policies  incorrect coding of the models  incorrect data being used by the models or inappropriate application of a model to products or events outside of the model s intended use 
in particular  models are less dependable when the economic environment is outside of historical experience  as has been the case recently 
in addition  we continually receive new economic data 
our critical accounting estimates  such as the size of our allowance for doubtful accounts  are subject to change  often significantly  due to the nature and magnitude of changes in economic conditions 
however  there is generally a lag between the availability of this economic information and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
when economic conditions change quickly and in unforeseen ways  there is a risk that the assumptions and inputs reflected in our models are not representative of current economic conditions 
due to the factors described above and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form k  we may be required or may deem it necessary to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in the future 
increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts would adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position 

table of contents changes in the economy  credit policies and practices  and the credit and capital markets have required frequent adjustments to our models and the application of greater management judgment in the interpretation and adjustment of the results produced by our models 
this application of greater management judgment reflects the need to take into account updated information while continuing to maintain controlled processes for model updates  including model development  testing  independent validation and implementation 
as a result of the time and resources  including technical and staffing resources  that are required to perform these processes effectively  it may not be possible to replace existing models quickly enough to ensure that they will always properly account for the impacts of recent information and actions 
an economic downturn or other events may affect consumer purchases from us as well as their ability to repay their credit obligations to us  which could have a prolonged negative effect on our net sales  gross margins and credit portfolio performance 
many factors affect spending  including regional or world events  war  conditions in financial markets  general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  energy and gasoline prices  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
our customers purchases of our products decline during periods when disposable income is lower or periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
recent turmoil in the national economy  including instability in financial markets and a potential combination of expiring tax cuts and mandatory federal spending reductions  decreases in consumer confidence and volatile oil prices have negatively impacted our markets and may present significant challenges to our operations in the future 
if this occurs  our net sales and results of operations would decline 
we face significant competition from national  regional  local and internet retailers of home appliances  consumer electronics  furniture and mattresses 
the retail market for consumer electronics  furniture and mattresses is highly fragmented and intensely competitive and the market for home appliances is concentrated among a few major dealers 
we currently compete against a diverse group of retailers  including national mass merchants such as sears  wal mart  target  sam s club and costco  specialized national retailers such as best buy  rooms togo and mattress firm  home improvement stores such as lowe s and home depot  and locally owned regional or independent retail specialty stores that sell home appliances  consumer electronics  furniture  and mattresses similar  and often identical  to those items we sell 
we also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the internet 
in addition  there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets  and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time 
additionally  we compete to some extent against companies offering credit constrained consumers products similar to those offered by us for the home under weekly or monthly rent to own payment options 
competitors include aarons and rent a center  as well as many smaller independent companies 
we may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors 
some of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be able to purchase inventory at lower costs and better endure economic downturns 
as a result  our sales may decline if we cannot offer competitive prices to our customers or we may be required to accept lower profit margins 
our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and may have greater resources to devote to promotion and sale of products and services 
if two or more competitors consolidate their businesses or enter into strategic partnerships  they may be able to compete more effectively against us 
our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us  including expansion by our existing competitors or entry by new competitors into markets where we currently operate  lower pricing  aggressive advertising and marketing  extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer  larger store size  which may result in greater operational efficiencies  or innovative store formats  and adoption of improved retail sales methods 
competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share  sales and customers  increase expenditures or reduce prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents if new products are not introduced or consumers do not accept new products  our sales may decline 
our ability to maintain and increase sales depends to a large extent on the periodic introduction and availability of new products and technologies 
it is possible that new products will never achieve widespread consumer acceptance or will be supplanted by alternative products and technologies that do not offer us a similar sales opportunity or are sold at lower price points or margins 
we have expanded the floor space dedicated to our furniture and mattress product offerings 
if the strategy of increasing our emphasis on furniture and mattress offerings is unsuccessful  it would have a materially adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 
if we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences  our sales will decline 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change 
our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to trends in consumer preferences relating to home appliances  consumer electronics and furniture 
if we fail to identify and respond to these changes  our sales of these products will decline 
in addition  we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors up to nine months in advance of proposed delivery dates 
significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory 
we may experience significant price pressures over the life cycle of our products from competing technologies and our competitors and we may not be able to maintain our historical gross margin levels 
prices for many of our products decrease over their life cycle 
such decreases often result in decreased gross profit margins for us 
there is also substantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce their total costs for products 
suppliers may also seek to reduce our margins on the sales of their products in order to increase their own profitability 
the consumer electronics industry depends on new products to drive same store sales increases 
typically  these new products  such as high definition flat panel including d  lcd  led and internet ready technology televisions  blu ray players and digital cameras are introduced at relatively high price points that are then gradually reduced as the product becomes mainstream 
to sustain positive same store sales growth  unit sales must increase at a rate greater than the decline in product prices 
the affordability of the product helps drive the unit sales growth 
however  as a result of relatively short product life cycles in the consumer electronics industry  which limit the amount of time available for sales volume to increase  combined with rapid price erosion in the industry  retailers are challenged to maintain overall gross margin levels and positive same store sales 
this has historically been our experience  and we continue to adjust our marketing strategies to address this challenge through the introduction of new product categories and new products within our existing categories 
if we fail to accurately anticipate the introduction of new technologies  we may possess significant amounts of obsolete inventory that can only be sold at substantially lower prices and profit margins than we anticipated 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain our historical margin levels in the future due to increased sales of lower margin products such as personal electronics products and declines in average selling prices of key products 
if sales of lower margin items continue to increase and replace sales of higher margin items or our consumer electronics products average selling prices decreases due to the maturity of their life cycle  our gross margin and overall gross profit levels will be adversely affected 
a disruption in our relationships with  in the operations of  or the supply of product from any of our key suppliers could cause our sales to decline 
the success of our business and growth strategies depends to a significant degree on our relationships with our suppliers  particularly our brand name suppliers such as dell  electrolux  franklin  frigidaire  general electric  hewlett packard  jackson catnapper  lg  samsung  sealy  serta  sharp  steve silver  sony  toshiba  and z line 
we do not have long term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with the majority of our vendors 
we typically order our inventory and repair parts through the issuance of individual purchase orders to vendors 
we also rely on our suppliers for cooperative advertising support 
we may be subject to rationing by suppliers with respect to a number of limited distribution items 
in addition  we rely heavily on a relatively small number of suppliers 
our top six suppliers represented of our purchases for fiscal year  and the top two suppliers represented approximately of our total purchases 
the loss of any one or more of these key vendors or failure to establish and maintain relationships with these and other vendors  and limitations on the availability of inventory or repair parts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if one of our vendors were to go out of business  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if such vendor is unable to fund amounts due to us  including payments due for returns of product and warranty claims 
catastrophic or other unforeseen events  such as the one which impacted japan during  could adversely impact the supply and delivery of products to us and could adversely impact our results of operations 
our ability to enter new markets successfully depends  to a significant extent  on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply merchandise to additional warehouses or stores 
if vendors are unwilling or unable to supply some or all of their products to us at acceptable prices in one or more markets  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents furthermore  we rely on credit from vendors to purchase our products 
as of january   we had million in accounts payable and million in merchandise inventories 
a substantial change in credit terms from vendors or vendors willingness to extend credit to us  including providing inventory under consignment arrangements  would reduce our ability to obtain the merchandise that we sell  which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 
our vendors also supply us with marketing funds and volume rebates 
if our vendors fail to continue these incentives it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 
you should not rely on our comparable store sales as an indication of our future results of operations because they fluctuate significantly 
our historical same store sales growth figures have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of factors have historically affected  and will continue to affect  our comparable store sales results  including changes in competition  such as pricing pressure  and the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets  general economic conditions  new product introductions  consumer trends  changes in our merchandise mix  changes in the relative sales price points of our major product categories  ability to offer credit programs attractive to our customers  the impact of any new stores on our existing stores  including potential decreases in existing stores sales as a result of opening new stores  weather conditions in our markets  timing of promotional events  timing  location and participants of major sporting events  reduction in new store openings  the percentage of our stores that are mature stores  the locations of our stores and the traffic drawn to those areas  how often we update our stores  and our ability to execute our business strategy effectively 
changes in our quarterly and annual comparable store sales results could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and quarterly results 
we typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results  with the quarter ending january  which includes the holiday selling season  generally accounting for a larger share of our net sales and net income 
we also incur significant additional expenses during such fiscal quarter due to higher purchase volumes and increased staffing 
if we miscalculate the demand for our products generally or for our product mix during the fiscal quarter ending january  or if we experience adverse events  such as bad weather in our markets during our fourth fiscal quarter  our net sales could decline  resulting in excess inventory or increased sales discounts to sell excess inventory  which would harm our financial performance 
a shortfall in expected net sales  combined with our significant additional expenses during this fiscal quarter  could cause a significant decline in our operating results and such sales may not be deferred to future periods 
our business could be adversely affected by changes in consumer protection laws and regulations 
federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations  such as the fair credit reporting act and the consumer financial protection bureau could limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit 
because our customers finance through our credit segment a substantial portion of our sales  any adverse change in the regulation of consumer credit could adversely affect our total sales and gross margins 
for example  new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees that may be charged on consumer credit accounts  including by reducing the maximum interest rate that can be charged in the states in which we operate  or restrict our ability to collect on account balances  which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 
compliance with existing and future laws or regulations  including regulations that may be applicable to us under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  which was enacted into law in july  could require us to make material expenditures  in particular personnel training costs  or otherwise adversely affect our business or financial results 
failure to comply with these laws or regulations  even if inadvertent  could result in negative publicity  fines or additional licensing expenses  any of which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 

table of contents we are required to comply with laws and regulations regulating credit extensions and other dealings with customer and our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations  or any adverse change in those laws or regulations  could have a negative impact on our business 
our customers finance through our credit segment a substantial portion of our sales 
we also sell our customers gift cards for redemption against future purchases 
providing credit and other financial products and otherwise dealing with consumers and information provided by consumers does or could subject us to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local government authorities  including the consumer financial protection bureau  which was created by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the federal trade commission  the sec  state regulators having jurisdiction over persons engaged in consumer sales  consumer credit and other financial products and consumer debt collection  and state attorneys general 
our business practices  including the terms of our marketing and advertising  our procedures and practices for credit applications and underwriting  the terms of our credit extensions and gift cards and related disclosures  our data privacy and protection practices  and our collection practices  may be subject to periodic or special reviews by these regulatory and enforcement authorities 
these reviews could range from investigations of specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries into our practices generally 
if as part of these reviews the regulatory authorities conclude that we are not complying with applicable law or regulations  they could request or impose a wide range of sanctions and remedies including requiring changes in advertising and collection practices  changes in our credit application and underwriting practices  changes in our data privacy or protection practices  changes in the terms of our credit or other financial products such as decreases in interest rates or fees  the imposition of fines or penalties  or the paying of restitution or the taking of other remedial action with respect to affected customers 
they also could require us to stop offering some of our credit or other financial products within one or more states  or nationwide 
negative publicity relating to any specific inquiry or investigation  regardless of whether we have violated any applicable law or regulation or the extent of any such violation  could negatively affect our reputation and our brand as well as our stock price  which would adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and would raise our costs of doing business 
if any deficiencies or violations of law or regulations are identified by us or asserted by any regulator or other person  or if any regulatory or enforcement authority or court requires us to change any of our practices  the correction of such deficiencies or violations  or the making of such changes  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or business 
we face the risk that restrictions or limitations resulting from the enactment  change  or interpretation of federal or state laws and regulations  such as the dodd frank act  could negatively affect our business activities  require us to make material expenditures or effectively eliminate credit products or other financial products currently offered to customers 
in addition  whether or not we modify our practices when a regulatory or enforcement authority or court requests or requires that we do so  there is a risk that we or other industry participants may be named as defendants in individual or class action litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations  including consumer protection laws and regulations 
any failure on our part to comply with legal requirements in connection with credit or other financial products  or in connection with servicing our accounts or collecting debts or otherwise dealing with consumers  could significantly impair our ability to collect the full amount of the account balances and could subject us to substantial liability for damages or penalties 
the institution of any litigation of this nature  or the rendering of any judgment  against us or any other industry participant in any litigation of this nature  could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
pending litigation relating to the sale of credit insurance and the sale of repair service agreements in the retail industry could adversely affect our business 
state attorney generals and private plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against other retailers relating to improper practices conducted in connection with the sale of credit insurance in several jurisdictions around the country 
we offer credit insurance in our stores on sales financed under our credit programs and require the customer to purchase property insurance from us or provide evidence from a third party insurance provider  at their election  in connection with sales of merchandise on installment credit  therefore  similar litigation could be brought against us 
while we believe we are in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations  if we are found liable in any future lawsuit regarding credit insurance or repair service agreements  we could be required to pay substantial damages or incur substantial costs as part of an out of court settlement or require us to modify or suspend certain operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
an adverse judgment or any negative publicity associated with our repair service agreements or any potential credit insurance litigation could also affect our reputation  which could have a negative impact on our cash flow and results of operations 

table of contents pending and potential litigation regarding alleged patent infringements could result in significant costs to us to defend what we consider to be spurious claims 
recently the manufacturing  retail and software industries have been the targets of patent litigation claimants filing claims or demands based upon alleged patent ownership infringement through the manufacturing and selling  either in merchandise or through software and internet websites  of product or merely providing access through website portals 
we  in conjunction with multiple other parties  have been the targets of such claims 
while we believe that we have not violated or infringed on any alleged patent ownership rights  and intend to defend vigorously any such claims  the cost to defend  settle or pay any such claims could be substantial  and could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 
our corporate actions may be substantially controlled by our principal shareholders and affiliated entities

their interests may conflict with the will or interests of our other equity holders 
while stephens inc and its affiliates held of our common stock as of january  through a voting trust that will vote the shares in the same proportion as votes cast by all other stockholders  this voting trust agreement will expire in october   unless extended  and upon expiration stephens inc and its affiliates will not be restricted on how it votes its shares 
these stockholders  acting individually or as a group  could exert substantial influence over matters such as electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions 
if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the qualified sales and credit granting and collection personnel required for our business  our operating results could suffer 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and continued service of our key executives or the identification of suitable successors for them 
if we lose the services of any of these individuals  or if one or more of them or other key personnel decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  and we are unable to identify a suitable successor  our business and operations could be harmed  and we could have difficulty in implementing our strategy 
in addition  as our business grows  we will need to locate  hire and retain additional qualified sales personnel in a timely manner and develop  train and manage an increasing number of management level sales associates and other employees 
additionally  if we are unable to attract and retain qualified credit granting and collection personnel  our ability to perform quality underwriting of new credit transactions and maintain workloads for our collections personnel at a manageable level  our operation could be adversely impacted and result in higher delinquency and net charge offs on our credit portfolio 
competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees  and increases in the federal minimum wage or other employee benefits costs could increase our operating expenses 
if we are unable to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future  our net sales and operating results could suffer 
our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal  state or local regulations 
changes in the federal  state or local minimum wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our cost of doing business 
in addition  changes in federal  state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our cost of doing business 
also  passage of the employer free choice act or similar laws in congress could lead to higher labor costs by encouraging unionization efforts among our associates and disruption of store operations 
because our stores are located in texas  louisiana  oklahoma  arizona and new mexico  and our distribution centers are located in texas  we are subject to regional risks 
our stores are located exclusively in texas  louisiana  oklahoma  arizona and new mexico and our five regional distribution centers are located in texas 
this subjects us to regional risks  such as the economy  weather conditions  hurricanes and other natural or man made disasters 
if the region suffers a continued or another economic downturn or any other adverse regional event  there could be an adverse impact on our net sales and results of operations and our ability to implement our planned expansion program 
several of our competitors operate stores across the united states and thus are not as vulnerable to the risks of operating in one region 
additionally  these states in general  and the local economies where many of our stores are located in particular  are dependent  to a degree  on the oil and gas industries  which can be very volatile 
additionally  because of fears of climate change and adverse effects of drilling explosions and oil spills in the gulf of mexico  legislation has been considered  and governmental regulations and orders have been issued  which  combined with the local economic and employment conditions caused by both  could materially and adversely impact the oil and gas industries and the areas in which a majority of our stores are located in texas and louisiana 
to the extent the oil and gas industries are negatively impacted by declining commodity prices  climate change or other legislation and other factors  we could be negatively impacted by reduced employment  or other negative economic factors that impact the local economies where we have our stores 
in addition  recent turmoil in the national economy  including instability in the financial markets  has impacted our local markets 
a downturn in the general economy  or in the region where we have our stores  could have a negative impact on our net sales and results of operations 

table of contents our information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business 
our ability to operate our business from day to day  in particular our ability to manage our credit operations and inventory levels  largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems 
we use management information systems to track inventory information at the store level  communicate customer information  aggregate daily sales information and manage our credit portfolio  including processing of credit applications and management of collections 
these systems and our operations are subject to damage or interruption from power loss  computer systems failures and internet  telecommunications or data network failures  operator negligence or improper operation by  or supervision of  employees  physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches  misappropriation and similar events  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events  and hurricanes  fires  floods and other natural disasters 
in addition  the software that we have developed to use in our daily operations may contain undetected errors that could cause our network to fail or our expenses to increase 
any failure of our systems due to any of these causes  if it is not supported by our disaster recovery plan  could cause an interruption in our operations and result in reduced net sales and results of operations 
though we have implemented contingency and disaster recovery processes in the event of one or several technology failures  any unforeseen failure  interruption or compromise of our systems or our security measures could affect our flow of business and  if prolonged  could harm our reputation 
the risk of possible failures or interruptions may not be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely  and such failures or interruptions could occur 
the occurrence of any failures or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
if we are unable to maintain our insurance licenses in the states we operate  our results of operations would suffer 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income from the commissions we earn from the sale of various insurance products of third party insurers to our customers 
these products include credit insurance  repair service agreements and product replacement policies 
we also are the direct obligor on certain extended repair service agreements we offer to our customers 
if for any reason we were unable to maintain our insurance licenses in the states we operate or if there are material claims or future material litigation involving our repair service agreements or product replacement policies  our results of operations would suffer 
if we are unable to continue to offer third party repair service agreements to our customers who purchase  or have purchased our products  we could incur additional costs or repair expenses  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there are a limited number of insurance carriers that provide repair service agreement programs 
if insurance becomes unavailable from our current providers for any reason  we may be unable to provide repair service agreements to our customers on the same terms  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain a substitute provider  higher premiums may be required  which could have an adverse impact on our profitability if we are unable to pass along the increased cost of such coverage to our customers 
inability to maintain the repair service agreement program could cause fluctuations in our repair expenses and greater volatility of earnings and could require us to become the obligor under new contracts sold 
if we are unable to maintain group credit insurance policies from insurance carriers  which allow us to offer their credit insurance products to our customers purchasing our merchandise on credit  our revenues would be reduced and the provision for bad debts might increase 
there are a limited number of insurance carriers that provide credit insurance coverage for sale to our customers 
if credit insurance becomes unavailable for any reason we may be unable to offer substitute coverage on the same terms  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain substitute coverage  it may be at higher rates or reduced coverage  which could affect the customer acceptance of these products  reduce our revenues or increase our credit losses 
changes in premium and commission rates allowed by regulators on the credit insurance  repair service agreements or product replacement agreements we sell as allowed by the laws and regulations in the states in which we operate could affect our revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income from the sale of various third party insurance products to our customers 
these products include credit insurance  repair service agreements and product replacement agreements 
if the commission we retain from sales of those products declines  our operating results would suffer 

table of contents changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations and other factors beyond our control could affect our business 
a significant portion of our inventory is manufactured and or assembled overseas and in mexico 
changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations or other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages of these items  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
conversely  significant reductions in the cost of these items in us dollars may cause a significant reduction in the retail prices of those products  resulting in a material adverse effect on our sales  margins or competitive position 
in addition  commissions earned on our credit insurance  repair service agreement or product replacement agreement products could be adversely affected by changes in statutory premium rates  commission rates  adverse claims experience and other factors 
our costs to protect our intellectual property rights  infringement of which could impair our name and reputation  could be significant 
we believe that our success and ability to compete depends in part on consumer identification of the name conn s 
we have registered the trademarks conn s  conn s homeplus  yes money  ye money  si money and our logos 
we intend to protect vigorously our trademark against infringement or misappropriation by others 
a third party  however  could attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property in the future 
the enforcement of our proprietary rights through litigation could result in substantial costs to us that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
failure to protect the security of our customer s information or failure to comply with data privacy and protection laws could expose us to litigation  judgments for damages  increased operating costs and undermine the trust placed with us by our customers 
we capture  transmit  handle and store sensitive information  which involves certain inherent security risks 
such risks include  among other things  the interception of customer data and information by persons outside us or by our own employees 
while we believe we have taken appropriate steps to protect confidential information  there can be no assurance that we can prevent the compromise of our customers data or other confidential information 
if such a breach should occur it could have a severe negative impact on our business and results of operations 
in addition  interpretation and application of privacy and customer data protection laws are in a state of flux and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  and various governmental entities are considering imposing new regulations on data privacy and protection 
these new regulations may be interpreted and applied inconsistently and our current policies and practices  which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
any changes in the tax laws of the states in which we operate could affect our state tax liabilities 
additionally  beginning operations in new states could also affect our state tax liabilities 
as we experienced in fiscal year with the change in the texas tax law  legislation could be introduced at any time that changes our state tax liabilities in a way that has an adverse impact on our results of operations 
the texas margin tax  which is based on gross profit rather than earnings  can create significant volatility in our effective tax rate 
the potential to enter new states in the future could adversely affect our results of operations  dependent upon the tax laws in place in those states 
significant volatility in oil and gasoline prices could affect our customers determination to drive to our stores  and cause us to raise our delivery charges 
significant volatility in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our customers shopping decisions and patterns 
we rely heavily on our distribution system and our next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers needs and desires  and increases in oil and gasoline prices could result in increased distribution charges 
such increases may not significantly affect our competitors 
failure to successfully utilize and manage e commerce could adversely affect our business and prospects 
our website is a significant driver of our sales and we believe represents a possible source for future sales growth 
in order to promote our products  allow our customers to complete credit applications in the privacy of their homes and drive traffic to our stores  we must effectively create  design  publish and distribute content 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to design and publish web content with a high level of effectiveness or grow our e commerce business in a profitable manner

our business is moderately seasonal  with a greater share of our revenues  operating and net income historically realized during the quarter ending january  due primarily to the holiday selling season 
application of critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on authoritative pronouncements  historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we could reasonably use different accounting estimates and changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
customer accounts receivable 
customer accounts receivable are originated at the time of sale and delivery of the various products and services we offer 
we include the amount of principal and accrued interest on those receivables that are expected to be collected within the next twelve months  based on contractual terms  in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
those amounts expected to be collected after twelve months  based on contractual terms  are included in long term assets 
typically  customer receivables are considered delinquent if a payment has not been received on the scheduled due date 
we offer re age programs to customers with past due balances that have experienced a financial hardship  if they meet the conditions of our re age policy 
re aging a customer s account can result in updating it from a delinquent status to a current status 
during fiscal  we implemented a policy which limits the number of months that an account can be re aged to a maximum of months 
as of july   we modified our charge off policy so that an account that is delinquent more than days at each month end is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts and interest accrued is charged to the allowance for uncollectible interest 
prior to july   we charged off all accounts that were delinquent more than days and for which no payment had been received in the past seven months 
we have a secured interest in the merchandise financed by these receivables and therefore have the opportunity to recover a portion of any charged off amount 
as part of our customer retention and expansion efforts  we may modify loans for certain borrowers 
restructured customer accounts receivable 
effective april   the fasb issued asu no 
 a creditor determination of whether restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring tdr  which clarifies when a loan modification or restructuring is considered a tdr 
this guidance clarifies what constitutes a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties  even if not currently in default 
the amendments in asu are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after june   or for the third quarter of fiscal for us  and should be applied retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the annual period of adoption with early adoption permitted 
loan modifications in which an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are accounted for and reported as tdrs 
in the quarter ended october   we adopted new accounting guidance that provides clarification on whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and whether a concession has been granted to the debtor for purposes of determining if a loan modification constitutes a tdr 
the adoption applies retrospectively to our loan restructurings after january  the company defines tdr accounts that originated subsequent to january   as accounts that have been re aged in excess of three months or refinanced 
for accounts originating prior to january   if the cumulative re aging exceeds three months and the accounts were re aged subsequent to january   the account is considered tdr 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million  net of previously provided reserves  related to the required adoption of the accounting guidance related to tdr accounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we monitor the aging of our past due accounts closely and focus our collection efforts on preventing accounts from becoming days past due or greater  which is a leading indicator of potential charge off 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts  including estimated uncollectible interest  for our customer and other accounts receivable  based on our historical cash collection and net loss experience using a projection of monthly delinquency performance  cash collections and losses 
in addition to pre charge off cash collections and charge off information  estimates of post charge off recoveries  including cash payments  amounts realized from the repossession of the products financed and  at times  payments received under credit insurance policies are also considered 

table of contents we determine reserves for those accounts that are tdrs based on the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of those accounts 
the excess of the carrying amount over the discounted cash flow amount is recorded as a reserve for loss on those accounts 
as a result of our practice of re aging customer accounts  if the account is not ultimately collected  the timing and amount of the charge off could be impacted 
if these accounts had been charged off sooner the historical net loss rates might have been higher 
as further discussed above  during fiscal  we implemented a new policy which limits the number of months that an account can be re aged to a cumulative maximum of months 
this change in the re age policy had the impact of increasing delinquencies and accelerating charge offs during fiscal and the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and uncollectible interest for customer receivables was million and million  at january   and  respectively 
the amount included in the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with principal and interest on tdr accounts was million and million as of january  and  respectively 
tdr accounts are segregated from the credit score stratification for reporting and measurement purposes 
if the loss rate used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts on non tdr loan principal and interest reserves was increased by at january   we would have increased our provision for bad debts by approximately million for fiscal the impact of a unfavorable change in the net present value calculation on tdr accounts would increase our provision for bad debts by approximately million as of january  interest income on customer accounts receivable 
interest income is accrued using the interest method for installment contracts and is reflected in finance charges and other 
typically  interest income is accrued until the contract or account is paid off or charged off and we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible interest 
we typically only place accounts in non accrual status when legally required to do so 
interest accrual is resumed on those accounts once a legally mandated settlement arrangement is reached or other payment arrangements are made with the customer 
interest income is recognized on our interest free promotional accounts based on our historical experience related to customers who fail to satisfy the requirements of the interest free programs 
we recognize interest income on tdr accounts using the interest income method  which requires reporting interest income equal to the increase in the net carrying amount of the loan attributable to the passage of time 
cash proceeds and other adjustments are applied to the net carrying amount such that it always equals the present value of expected future cash flows 
inventories 
inventories consist of finished goods or parts and are valued at the lower of cost moving weighted average cost method or fair market value through the establishment of inventory reserves 
our inventory reserve represents the excess of the carrying amount  typically weighted average cost  over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposition of the inventory 
the inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  projected consumer demand and market availability and obsolescence of products on hand 
if estimates regarding consumer demand or the net realizable value that can be obtained for certain products is affected in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our actual inventory reserve at january   would have affected our cost of goods sold by approximately million 
property and equipment impairment 
property and equipment are evaluated for impairment at the retail store level 
the company performs a periodic assessment of assets for impairment 
additionally  an impairment evaluation is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
the most likely condition that would necessitate an assessment would be an adverse change in historical and estimated future results of a retail store s performance 
for property and equipment to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment loss if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the anticipated cash flows over the remaining term of the lease utilizing certain unobservable inputs 
impairment charges of million and million were recorded for the years ended january  and  related to stores being closed 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of retail products are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the product 
such revenues are recognized net of any adjustments for sales incentive offers such as discounts  coupons  rebates  or other free products or services and discounts of promotional credit sales that will extend beyond one year 
we sell repair service agreements and credit insurance contracts on behalf of unrelated third parties 
for contracts where the third parties are the obligors on the contract  commissions are recognized in revenues at the time of sale  and in the case of retrospective commissions  at the time that they are earned 
vendor allowances 
we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates earned upon purchase or sale of product  marketing  training and promotion programs which are recorded on the accrual basis as a reduction to the related product cost 
we accrue rebates based on the satisfaction of terms of the program and sales of qualifying products even though funds may not be received until the end of a quarter or year 
if the programs are related to product purchases  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of product cost and if the programs are related to product sales  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
we received million  million and million in vendor allowances during the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
over the past three years we have received funds from approximately vendors  with the terms of the programs ranging between one month and one year 

table of contents accounting for leases 
we analyze each lease  at its inception and any subsequent renewal  to determine whether it should be accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
additionally  monthly lease expense for each operating lease is calculated as the average of all payments required under the minimum lease term  including rent escalations 
generally  the minimum lease term begins with the date we take possession of the property and ends on the last day of the minimum lease term  and includes all rent holidays  but excludes renewal terms that are at our option 
any tenant improvement allowances received are deferred and amortized into income as a reduction of lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
the amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements 
for transactions that qualify for treatment as a sale leaseback  any gain or loss is deferred and amortized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
any deferred gain would be included in deferred gain on sale of property and any deferred loss would be included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
for locations that have ceased operation with remaining lease obligations  we record an accrual for the present value of the remaining lease obligations and anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  net of estimated sublease income 
the estimate is based on our best projection of the sublease rates we believe can be obtained for those properties and our best estimate of the marketing time it will take to find tenants to sublet those stores 
revisions to these projections of the estimated buyout terms or sublease rates are made to the obligation as further information related to the actual terms and costs becomes available 
operational changes and operating environment we have implemented  continued to focus on  or modified operating initiatives that we believe should positively impact future results  including opening expanded conn s homeplus stores in new markets 
during  we opened one new store in waco  texas in june  another new store in albuquerque  new mexico in november and three additional stores in el paso and fort worth  texas and tucson  arizona in december 
we plan to open to additional stores in fiscal year  remodeling existing stores utilizing the new conn s homeplus format to increase retail square footage and improve our customers shopping experience  expanding and enhancing our product offering of higher margin furniture and mattresses  focusing on higher price  higher margin products to improve operating performance  reviewing our existing store locations to ensure the customer demographics and retail sales opportunity are sufficient to achieve our store performance expectations  and selectively closing or relocating stores to achieve those goals 
in this regard  we closed retail locations in fiscal year and two additional stores in fiscal year that did not perform at the level we expect for mature store locations  augmenting our credit offerings through the use of third party consumer credit providers to provide flexible financing options to meet the varying needs of our customers  while focusing the use of our credit program to offer credit to customers where third party programs are not available  assessing the ability to approve customers being declined today  as retail margin and portfolio yield may provide the ability to finance these customers profitably  and limiting the number of months an account can be re aged and reducing the period of time a delinquent account can remain outstanding before it is charged off 
additionally  we have shortened contract terms for higher risk products and smaller balances originated

the reduction in sg a expense was driven by the decrease in credit segment expenses  as we improved the efficiency of our collection operations and as the credit quality of the receivables in the portfolio improved 
this decrease was partially offset by our investment in sales staffing  in support of our growth initiatives  to drive sales growth in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal and on an ongoing basis 
additionally  reduced credit card fees  depreciation expense  benefit expenses  general insurance expense and postage costs were partially offset by higher professional fees  management bonuses and severance accruals

we have experienced an improvement in our credit portfolio performance specifically  the trends in the payment rate and percent of the portfolio re aged since fiscal and our total net charge offs of customer and non customer accounts receivable decreased by million compared to the prior period 
however  the provision for bad debts increased as we were required to record a charge of million during fiscal related to the required adoption of new tdr accounting guidance 
additionally  on july   we revised our charge off policy that requires an account that is delinquent more than days at month end to be charged off 
the change in policy had the impact of accelerating approximately million in net charge offs  which were charged against previously provided bad debt reserves 

table of contents year ended january  dollars in millions change costs related to store closings impairment of long lived assets charges and credits during the fiscal year ended january   we closed of the underperforming retail locations that we had plans to close 
as a result of the closure of the nine stores with unexpired leases  we recorded an accrual for the present value of remaining lease obligations and anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  net of estimated sublease income 
we recognized million of those and other costs related to the store closings in fiscal during fiscal year and  we decided to close and store locations  respectively 
in conjunction with our review of long lived assets for potential impairment  we determined that it was appropriate to record an impairment charge related to the long lived assets  primarily leasehold improvements  at the stores that are closed 
year ended january  dollars in millions change interest expense the decrease in interest expense was due to lower overall debt balance outstanding during the current year period  partially offset by the higher borrowing rates on term loan paid off during the second quarter

year ended january  dollars in millions change provision benefit for income taxes as a percent of income before taxes the decline in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by the decline in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate in both periods are impacted because taxes for the state of texas are based on gross margin and are not affected by changes in income before income taxes 
impact of inflation and changing prices we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
however  price deflation  primarily in consumer electronics has impacted our net sales and results of operations 
a significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our customers shopping decisions and patterns 
we rely heavily on our distribution system and our next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers needs and desires  and any such significant increases could result in increased distribution charges 
such increases may not affect our competitors in the same manner as it affects us 

table of contents seasonality and quarterly results of operations our business is somewhat seasonal  with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends january  due primarily to the holiday selling season 
in addition  historically our results of operations and portfolio performance for our first fiscal quarter are stronger than for our second fiscal quarter 
our quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending on factors such as the following timing of new product introductions  new store openings and store relocations  sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions  one time charges incurred  such as financing cost write offs incurred in the third quarter of fiscal  and changes in our merchandise mix

liquidity and capital resources cash flow operating activities 
during the twelve months ended january   net cash used by operating activities was million  which compares to million provided during the prior year period 
the year over year improvement in operating performance was more than offset by the use of cash to fund a million increase in customer accounts receivable during the twelve months ended january  as compared to an increase in customer receivables of million in the twelve months ended january  in the current year period  the impact of investments in inventory was offset by an increase in accounts payable 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in the twelve months ended january   as compared to million in the twelve months ended january   primarily due to expenditures for store remodels and relocations  partially offset by cash received from the sale lease back transaction  which occurred in the fourth quarter 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale and long term lease back of four owned properties 
the gain associated with the sale was deferred and is being amortized over the life of the lease associated with those properties 
we expect during the next twelve months to invest between million and million  net of tenant allowances  in capital expenditures for new stores  remodels and other projects 
we expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures with cash from operations  borrowings under our asset based revolving credit facility and tenant allowances from landlords 
financing activities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we issued million shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million which was used to pay down outstanding balances under our asset based revolving credit facility 
additionally  we sold four owned properties and received net proceeds of approximately million in connection with the sale  which was used to repay borrowings under our real estate loan and asset based lending facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended january   compared to net cash used in financing activities of million during the twelve months ended january  liquidity 
we require capital to finance our growth as we add new stores and markets to our operations  which in turn requires additional working capital for increased customer receivables and inventory 
we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash flow generated from earnings and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended terms provided by our vendors for inventory purchases  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements and transfers of customer receivables to asset backed securitization facilities 
we have an asset based revolving credit facility with capacity of million as of january  and million as of march  the facility matures in september and provides funding based on a borrowing base calculation that includes customer accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  based on a leverage ratio defined as total liabilities to tangible net worth 
in addition to the leverage ratio  the revolving credit facility includes a fixed charge coverage requirement  a minimum customer receivables cash recovery percentage requirement and a net capital expenditures limit 
the leverage ratio covenant requirement is a required maximum of to 
the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement is a minimum of to 
we expect  based on current facts and circumstances  that we will be in compliance with the above covenants for the next months 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the asset based revolving credit facility was at january  
table of contents on april   our vie issued million of notes which bear interest at and were sold at a discount to deliver a yield  before considering transaction costs 
the principal balance of the notes  which are secured by certain customer receivables  will be reduced on a monthly basis by collections on the underlying customer receivables after the payment of interest and other expenses of the vie 
while the final maturity for the notes is april  we currently expect to repay any outstanding note balance in april additionally  the notes include a prepayment incentive fee  whereby the vie will be required to pay  in addition to accrued interest on the notes  a monthly fee equal to an annual rate of times the outstanding principal balance  if the notes are not repaid by the expected final principal payment date of april  the vie s borrowing agreement contains certain covenants  including a minimum net worth requirement for the vie 
in january  we repaid a real estate loan  which was collateralized by three of our owned store locations and was scheduled to mature in july during the quarter ended october  we entered into interest rate cap option transactions with a notional amount of million 
these cap options are held for the purpose of hedging against variable interest rate risk related to the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on a portion of its variable rate debt  based on the benchmark one month libor interest rate exceeding 
these cap options have monthly caplets extending through august the weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding under all our credit facilities for the year ended january  was  including the interest expense associated with our interest rate caps and amortization of deferred financing costs 
actual required minimum maximum fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed required minimum to to total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio must be lower than required maximum to to cash recovery percentage must exceed stated amount capital expenditures  net must be lower than required maximum million million a summary of the significant financial covenants that govern our new credit facilities compared to our actual compliance status at january  is presented below note all terms in the above table are defined by the revolving credit facility and may or may not agree directly to the financial statement captions in this document 
the covenants are calculated quarterly on a trailing month basis  except for the cash recovery percentage  which is calculated monthly on a trailing three month basis 
as of january   we had immediately available borrowing capacity of million under our asset based revolving credit facility  net of standby letters of credit issued  available to us for general corporate purposes 
in addition to the million available under the revolving credit facility as of january   an additional million may become available if we grow the balance of eligible customer receivables and total eligible inventory balances 
payments received on customer receivables averaged approximately million per month during the fiscal year ended january   and are available each month to fund new customer receivables generated 
during fiscal  we expect to grow the balance of the credit portfolio 
we will continue to finance our operations and future growth through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including bank debt and securitization facilities  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory and acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory and acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements will be sufficient to fund our operations  store expansion and updating activities and capital programs for at least the next months  subject to continued compliance with the covenants in our credit facilities 
additionally  if there is a default under any of the facilities that is not waived by the various lenders  it could result in the requirement to immediately begin repayment of all amounts owed under our credit facilities  as all of the facilities have cross default provisions that would result in default under all of the facilities if there is a default under any one of the facilities 
if the repayment of amounts owed under our credit facilities is accelerated for any reason  we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at such time to be able to immediately repay all the amounts owed under the facilities 

table of contents the revolving credit facility is a significant factor relative to our ongoing liquidity and our ability to meet the cash needs associated with the growth of our business 
our inability to use this program because of a failure to comply with its covenants would adversely affect our business operations 
funding of current and future customer receivables under the borrowing facilities can be adversely affected if we exceed certain predetermined levels of re aged customer receivables  write offs  bankruptcies or other ineligible customer receivable amounts 
capital expenditures 
we lease all of our stores  and our plans for future store locations include primarily leases  but do not exclude store ownership 
our capital expenditures for future new store projects should primarily be for our tenant improvements to the property leased including any new distribution centers and warehouses  the cost of which is estimated to be between million and million per store before landlord contributions  and for our existing store remodels  estimated to range between  and  per store remodel  depending on store size 
in the event we purchase existing properties  our capital expenditures will depend on the particular property and whether it is improved when purchased 
we are continuously reviewing new relationship and funding sources and alternatives for new stores  which may include sale leaseback or direct purchase lease programs  as well as other funding sources for our purchase and construction of those projects 
if we are successful in these relationship developments  our direct cash needs should include only our capital expenditures for tenant improvements to leased properties and our remodel programs for existing stores  but could include full ownership 
in addition to remodeling existing stores  we reinstated our store opening strategy during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we opened five new stores and plan to open to new stores during fiscal year our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year is million to million  net of landlord allowances 
contractual obligations 
the following table presents a summary of our known contractual obligations as of january   with respect to the specified categories  classified by payments due per period 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt revolving credit facility asset backed notes other notes operating leases real estate equipment purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations if the outstanding balance as of january  and the interest rate in effect at that time were to remain the same over the remaining life of the facility  interest payments on the facility would be approximately million for the fiscal years ended january   and and million for the fiscal year ended january   respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates under our expanded asset based revolving credit facility are variable and bear interest at libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  based on a leverage ratio defined as total liabilities to tangible net worth 
accordingly  changes in libor will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  these credit facilities 
the balance outstanding under our asset based revolving credit facility has decreased from million at january  to million at january  the notional balance of interest caps used to fix the rate on a portion of asset based revolving credit facility balance was million at january  these interest rate caps will offset any interest rate increases once the libor rate exceeds 
accordingly  a basis point increase in interest rates on the asset based revolving credit facility would increase our borrowing costs by million over a month period  based on the balance outstanding at january   after considering the impact of the interest rate caps 
interest rate risk management 
we did not enter into any risk management trading activities during the year ended january  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 

table of contents our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate price risks related to fluctuations in interest payments on libor based floating rate debt instruments through the use of financial derivative instruments 
our risk management strategy involves capping floating interest rates through the use of a series of purchased swaps and or purchased put option caps 
these caps seek to mitigate the impact of upward floating interest rates on future cash flows when the libor rate exceeds 
these financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges 
our risk management activities include the use of financial derivative instruments including  but not limited to  price swaps and options to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential increases to interest expenses 
we enter into these financial derivative instruments directly with third parties in the over the counter market 
market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates are monitored by senior management 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk related to floating rate debt 
any swaps and options outstanding as of january  and that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed using a hypothetical basis point adverse change in libor rates for all forward months within the terms of the risk management derivatives 
there was no potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a basis point adverse movement in libor interest rates as of january  the transactions being hedged are subject to increased interest payments on increasing interest rates up to the hedging cap rate of a libor rate of 
the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal basis points  thus actual results may differ 
our sensitivity analysis includes designated hedging and the anticipated transactions associated with these hedging transactions 
these hedging transactions are anticipated to be very close to effective once the hedged cap level is reached  therefore  there is essentially no effect on our sensitivity analysis from these hedging positions 
to the extent option contracts are used as hedging instruments for anticipated transactions we have included the offsetting effect of the anticipated transactions  only to the extent the option contracts are in the money  or would become in the money as a result of the basis point hypothetical movements in prices 
credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties for financial hedging derivative instruments that we believe significantly minimize overall credit risk 
these policies include an evaluation of counterparties financial condition including credit ratings  and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit guidelines 
these counterparties consist of major financial institutions 
the overall impact due to certain changes in economic  regulatory and other events may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively in that counterparties may similarly be impacted 
based on our policies  exposures  credit and other reserves  management does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty performance
