executive overview national health investors  inc  a maryland corporation incorporated in  is a real estate investment trust reit which invests in income producing health care properties primarily in the long term care and senior housing industries 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of real estate excluding the corporate office and assets held for sale and mortgage and other note investments with a carrying value totaling  and other investments in the preferred stock and marketable securities of other reits with a carrying value of  resulting in total invested assets of  we are a self managed reit with our own management reporting directly to our board of directors 
our mission is to invest in health care real estate or in the operations thereof through independent third party managers which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
we have pursued this mission by investing primarily in leased properties  loans and ridea transactions 
these investments include assisted living facilities and their operations  senior living campuses  independent living  skilled nursing facilities  medical office buildings and hospitals  all of which are collectively referred to herein as health care facilities 
we have historically funded these investments through three sources of capital current cash flow  the sale of equity securities  and debt offerings  including bank lines of credit  the issuance of convertible debt instruments  and the issuance of ordinary term debt 
portfolio at december   our continuing operations consisted of investments in real estate and mortgage notes receivable in health care facilities located in states consisting of assisted living facilities  senior living campuses  independent living facilities  skilled nursing facilities  medical office buildings  hospitals and other notes receivable 
these investments consisted of approximately  of net real estate investments in health care facilities with lessees and  aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable from borrowers related to health care facilities 
national healthcare corporation nhc  is a publicly held company and our largest customer 
under a master lease agreement dated october   we lease health care facilities to nhc  six of which are included among our discontinued operations as discussed below 
the properties included in continuing operations are comprised of independent living facilities and snfs of which are subleased to other parties for whom the lease payments are guaranteed to us by nhc under the master lease agreement 
a year renewal term began january   and included additional year renewal options  each at fair rental value of such leased property as negotiated between the parties and determined without including the value attributable to any improvements to the leased property voluntarily made by the tenant at its expense 
in december  we entered into an extension to the master lease agreement with nhc through december under the terms of the lease  rent escalates by of the increase  if any  in each facility s revenue over a base year 
we refer to this additional rent component as percentage rent 
the following table summarizes the percentage rent received and recognized from nhc in thousands year ended december  current year prior year final certification total percentage rent for purposes of the percentage rent calculation described in the master lease agreement  nhc s annual revenue by facility for a given year is certified to nhi by march st of the following year

in december  we entered into a letter of agreement for the sale of six older skilled nursing facilities to the current lessee  nhc  for  in cash 
the sale is to be completed on december  effective january   nhi s annual base rent of  will be reduced to  accordingly  we have reclassified those assets to be sold to nhc as held for sale as of december   and the results of operation of the facilities held for sale were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of income

as of december   our average effective annual rental income was  per bed for snfs   per unit for alfs   per unit for ilfs   per bed for hospitals  and per square foot for mobs 
we invest a portion of our funds in the preferred and common shares of other publicly held healthcare reits to ensure a substantial portion of our assets are invested for real estate purposes 
at december   such investments were  areas of focus we are evaluating and will potentially make investments in while continuing to monitor and improve our existing properties 
even as we make new investments  we expect to maintain a relatively low level of debt compared to the value of our assets and relative to our peers in the industry 
approximately of our revenue from continuing operations is from operators of our skilled nursing facilities that receive a significant portion of their revenue from governmental payors  primarily medicare and medicaid 
such revenues are subject annually to statutory and regulatory changes  and in recent years  have been reduced due to federal and state budgetary pressures 
as a result  in we began to diversify our portfolio by focusing a significant portion of our investments into private pay assisted living  memory care and other properties which do not rely primarily on medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
according to a recent estimate by the us department of health and human services  the number of americans and older is expected to grow between and  compared to a growth rate for the general population 
an increase in this age demographic is expected to increase the demand for senior housing properties in the coming decades 
our new investments in real estate and mortgage notes in are expected to be funded by our liquid investments and by debt financing 
we intend to make new investments that meet our underwriting criteria and where we believe the spreads over our cost of capital will generate sufficient returns to our shareholders 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
we consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates  judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows valuations and impairments to our investments the majority of our tenants and borrowers are in the long term health care industry snfs and alfs where snfs derive their revenues primarily from medicare  medicaid and other government programs 
amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints 
from time to time  there may be material changes in government reimbursement 
in the past  snfs have experienced material reductions in government reimbursement 
the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and 
table of contents court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers 
in prior years  we have determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred as a result of these events 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property by property basis 
on a quarterly basis  we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances  including significant physical changes in the property  significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property  indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
the need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property 
if recognition of an impairment charge is necessary  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of contractual loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis 
on a quarterly basis  we review our notes receivable for ability to realize on such notes when events or circumstances  including the non receipt of contractual principal and interest payments  significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable 
if necessary  impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or  if foreclosure is probable  the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable 
we evaluate our marketable equity securities for other than temporary impairments 
an impairment of a marketable equity security would be considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
for our arrangement with bickford discussed below  our initial allocation of the purchase price reflects estimated cash flows resulting from the separate activities and sources of cash resulting from the venture  using discounted cash flow methods in accordance with our policies 
as with our real estate investments  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on an individual basis 
on a quarterly basis  we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances  including significant physical changes in the property or deterioration of the operations  significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the entities  indicate that the carrying amount of the entities may not be recoverable 
the need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a source compared to the carrying value of that property or  for the operating company  its operations 
if recognition of an impairment charge is necessary  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the fair value of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from that source 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties and arrangement with bickford are recoverable and our notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally  our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers  for whom we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent is not probable of collection until received 
for these investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight line basis to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible 
lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property  such as an increase in annual revenues over a base year revenues  are considered to be contingent rentals  are included in rental income when they are determinable and earned  and are excluded from future minimum lease payments 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements 
our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws  and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized 
we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
effective october   we began to record income tax expense or benefit with respect to our subsidiary which will be taxed as a taxable reit subsidiary trs under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations 
aside from such income taxes that may be applicable to the taxable income in our trs  we will not be subject to us federal income tax  provided that we continue to qualify as a reit and make distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of our taxable income 
this treatment substantially eliminates 
table of contents the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts  the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint ventures in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests 
in addition  we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities vie in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary 
all material inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
we apply financial accounting standards board fasb guidance for our arrangements with variable interest entities vies which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
a vie is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics a the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity activities without additional subordinated financial support  b as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk lack i the ability to make decisions about the entity activities through voting or similar rights  ii the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or iii the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  or c the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests  and substantially all of the entity activities either involve  or are conducted on behalf of  an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we may change our original assessment of a vie due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary 
real property developed by us is recorded at cost  including the capitalization of interest during construction 
the cost of real property investments acquired is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
tangible assets primarily consist of land  buildings and improvements 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable intangible assets  if any 
we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component 
the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to land  equipment  buildings and other improvements  and intangible assets  if any 
our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term 
new real estate investments during  we made real estate investments and commitments totaling  which are listed below and more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asset class amount waiy ridea structure alf purchase and lease alf construction commitment alf purchase and lease slc purchase and lease snf weighted average investment yield cash yield at time of investment bickford on september   we acquired two assisted living memory care facilities in kansas totaling units from our current tenant  bickford 
the real estate properties are held in our consolidated subsidiary propco  of which we retain an ownership interest with eight other assisted living memory care facilities that we own 
the previous master lease with bickford was renegotiated so that effective october   the ten facilities are now leased to an unconsolidated operating entity opco of which we acquired an ownership interest 
for accounting purposes  we treated the arrangement as an asset acquisition which included the purchase of two properties in propco and the acquisition of an ownership interest in opco which is controlled 
table of contents by bickford  or its affiliates 
the master lease between propco and opco is for an initial term of five years  plus renewal options  at an initial annual lease amount of  of which  is a guaranteed annual distribution to nhi  plus a annual escalator 
the previous master lease to bickford covering eight facilities provided lease revenue of  per year at the time of the transaction 
we structured our arrangement with bickford to be compliant with the provisions of the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of ridea which permits nhi to receive rent payments through a triple net lease between propco and opco  and to give nhi the opportunity to capture additional value on the improving performance of the operating company through distributions to a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
accordingly  the trs holds our equity interest in opco in order to provide an organizational structure that will allow the trs to engage in a broad range of activities and share in revenues that would otherwise be non qualifying income under the reit gross income tests 
our description of the consideration given to bickford and the fair value received by nhi is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the transaction described above  bickford granted us the exclusive right to their future acquisitions  development projects and refinancing transactions 
at december   we had purchased land and begun construction on three assisted living facilities having a maximum cost of  our costs incurred to date were  propco and opco were established to grant an and equity interest in each entity to nhi and bickford  respectively 
at propco  all operations encompassing ordinary course of business activities are under nhi management as the managing member 
opco activities are managed through an eligible independent contractor affiliated with  appointed under  and subject to the oversight of bickford 
this organizational structure is designed to meet the requirements of internal revenue code regulations for trs entities 
at propco  certain major business decisions require bickford consent in order to protect its interests  therefore leaving control with nhi 
bickford is the managing member of opco  although nhi has retained certain noncontrolling rights 
as a result of bickford retention of operations oversight and control over all day to day business matters  our participative influence at opco does not amount to control of the entity 
because of our control of ordinary course of business activities in propco  we include its assets  liabilities  and operations in our consolidated financial statements 
we report our investment in opco  over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  under the equity method of accounting 
for the year ended december   opco made lease payments to propco of  and our equity in the earnings of opco was  we believe that this trs structure will facilitate certain future acquisitions of senior housing assets and permit us to share in revenues that would otherwise be non qualifying income under the reit gross income tests 
however  our decision to acquire future assisted living or skilled nursing assets using the trs structure will depend upon our ability to negotiate purchase terms and structure our involvement in a way that complies with the rules governing reits and that is economically beneficial to our shareholders 
other lease activity in june  due to material noncompliance with our lease terms  we terminated our lease with a former tenant of four assisted living and memory care facilities in minnesota and transitioned the lease to a new tenant 
the unplanned transition to a new tenant resulted in a write off for accounting purposes of  in straight line rent receivables   in billed receivables and  in legal and other expenses 
the former lease provided for a current annual lease amount of  the facilities contain a total of units  are four to eight years old  and are now being leased to affiliates of white pine senior living white pine for an initial term of years at an annual lease amount of  plus annual fixed escalators 
the first six months of the lease contains additional supplemental rent payments totaling  our rental income  regardless of the timing of scheduled payments  is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and amounted to  through december  our leases are typically structured as triple net leases on single tenant properties having an initial leasehold term of to years with one or more year renewal options 
as such  there may be interim or annual reporting periods in which we do not experience a lease renewal or expiration 
during the year ended december   we renewed one lease 
the expiring lease on a hospital facility had an original term of years and an annual lease payment of  per bed 
the new lease agreement is for an initial period of years  plus one year renewal option and  based on current market and property specific factors  requires an annual lease payment of  per bed 
in december  we entered into an extension to the master lease agreement with nhc through december planned or completed dispositions of certain real estate 
table of contents in december  our tenant  sunrise senior living  exercised its purchase option to acquire for  in cash our assisted living facility in edison  nj which had a carrying value of  we deferred recognition of the tax gain on the sale of this facility by utilizing the like kind exchange rules under section of the internal revenue code 
in december  we entered into a letter of agreement with our tenant and major customer  nhc  to sell six older skilled nursing facilities for  in cash 
the sale is to be completed on december  effective january   nhi annual base rent of  will be reduced to  in january  we completed the sale of a skilled nursing facility in texas having a carrying value of  for cash proceeds of  in february  we completed the sale of two medical office buildings having a carrying value of  for cash proceeds of  in august  we completed the sale of a unit assisted living facility located in daytona beach  florida with a carrying value of  for cash proceeds of  in september  we canceled our agreement to sell five skilled nursing facilities in texas to our current tenant 
this portfolio no longer meets accounting criteria as being held for sale  and we have reclassified to the land and buildings accounts  previously reported in our consolidated balance sheet as assets held for sale 
in the third quarter of  we recorded  in depreciation expense  which is the expense that would have been recognized as depreciation on these properties had the disposal group been continuously classified as held and used 
we recorded no impairment 
we have reclassified the results of operations of facilities sold or held for sale at december  as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of income 
investments in mortgage and other notes receivable in april   we entered into a three year loan to provide capital funding group  inc cfg up to  to be used as mezzanine financing for its bridge to hud lending program 
outstanding borrowings were  at december  this loan requires monthly payments of interest only at an annual rate of 
during  we committed loans to other borrowers of  of which the outstanding balance was  at december  real estate and mortgage notes receivable write downs and recoveries our borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to other health care providers 
governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower or at least slow the growth in payments to health care providers 
furthermore  the costs of professional liability insurance have increased significantly during this same period 
since inception  a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have experienced bankruptcy 
others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or for certain periods have failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us 
the following table summarizes our write downs and recoveries for the last three years for both continuing and discontinued operations in thousands years ended december  mortgage notes impairments recoveries in december  we received from our current borrower a payment of  in full settlement of our note receivable secured by three skilled nursing facilities in georgia formerly owned by allgood healthcare  inc the payment consisted of note principal of  accrued interest of  a recovery of a previous writedown of  and a note gain of  related to an equity participation in the loan 
the recovery and gain are included in separate components of our income from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of income 
these facilities had previously been involved in bankruptcy proceedings with the former owner  allgood 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we recorded a  impairment on a note receivable from seniortrust of florida  inc which had a carrying value of  at december  the impairment was based on nhi continuing collection history with seniortrust and was estimated consistently with our policy of using discounted cash flow techniques at an interest rate explicit in the note 
see our discussion below  under potential effects of reductions in medicare reimbursement  for additional information on this write down 
during  we received a payment of  as a recovery of a previous note write down 
the payment resulted from the full payoff of a note receivable related to a snf in oklahoma 
during  we received payments totaling  as a recovery of previous mortgage note write downs 
the payments resulted from the settlement of bankruptcy proceedings related to our former borrower algood to whom we had originally provided mortgage note financing for five snfs in georgia 
we believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and our mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral 
however  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts 
security writedowns and recoveries a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and consider whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to a reporting date and forecasted performance of the investment 
at december   we concluded there were no other than temporary impairments of our marketable securities 
during  we sold  shares of ltc properties  inc ltc for an average price of per share 
as a result  we recorded  as a gain on the sale   of which was a recovery of a previously recorded other than temporary impairment 
potential effects of reductions in medicare reimbursement in july  cms announced the final rule for fiscal that increased medicare payments to snf operators by a net for the fiscal year beginning october  the final rule for does not take into account the ongoing attempt by congress to reduce the federal deficit by trillion over the next decade as required by the budget control act of the failure of congress to agree on spending reductions to meet deficit goals would trigger automatic spending cuts of to medicare 
we currently estimate the majority of our borrowers and lessees will be able to withstand the potential medicare cut described above due to their credit quality  profitability and their debt or lease coverage ratios  although no assurances can be given as to what the ultimate effect such medicare cuts will have on each of our borrowers and lessees 
however  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our not for profit borrowers seniortrust of florida  inc and eldertrust of florida  inc 
have appointed receivers to effect the sale of their assets and the winding up of the affairs of those entities 
these two mortgage borrowers have been adversely impacted by previous medicare cuts due to their payor mix  their current payment coverage ratios and limited net equity 
the impact of further reduction in medicare reimbursement could negatively affect their ability to make full scheduled payments to us and could have an adverse effect on the value of the underlying real estate assets 
we have been in discussions with these borrowers regarding the possible sale of their real estate assets 
the mortgage notes receivable from the borrowers have an aggregate principal balance of  at december  and interest income amounted to  for the year then ended 
we evaluate the carrying value of our mortgage notes receivable on an instrument by instrument basis 
on a quarterly basis  we review our notes receivable for the effects of events or circumstances  including the non receipt of contractual principal and interest payments  significant deterioration of the financial condition of the borrower or significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  that indicate the carrying value of a note receivable may not be recoverable 
if necessary  an impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or  if foreclosure is probable  the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable 

table of contents as we have continued to receive interest only payments on the seniortrust mortgage note receivables  we have based our cash flow analysis on probability weighted alternatives ranging from continuation of the status quo to partial collection with cessation of interest 
accordingly  as described above under real estate and mortgage notes receivable write downs and recoveries  we recognized the impairment to the carrying value of the seniortrust note in the amount of  as discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  representatives of seniortrust and eldertrust have filed lawsuits against nhi 
the company has denied these claims and intends to vigorously defend against these complaints 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our real estate properties on a property by property basis 
on a quarterly basis  we review our properties for events or circumstances that indicate the carrying value of the property may not be recoverable 
the need to recognize an impairment is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property 
if recognition of an impairment is necessary  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property 
we believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and that mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral 
however  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts 
we recognize interest income in the period in which cash is received on certain mortgage notes receivable which were previously classified as non performing 
these notes have an aggregate carrying value of  at december  
table of contents results of operations the results of operations for facilities included in assets held for sale or sold  including the gain or loss on such sales  have been reported in the current and prior periods as discontinued operations

table of contents financial highlights of the year ended december  compared to the same period in were as follows rental income increased  or when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of funding new real estate investments of  in and  in  including debt assumed in our arrangement with bickford 
future increases in rental income depend on our ability to make new investments which meet our underwriting criteria 
interest income from mortgage and other notes increased  due to new loan investments of  funded in and  funded in unless we continue to make new investments in loans in and future years  our interest income will decrease due to the normal amortization and scheduled maturities of our loans 
depreciation expense increased  or primarily as the result of  included in for the facilities leased to fundamental which were reclassified from discontinued operations after the agreement to sell the facilities was canceled 
the adjustment to depreciation expense of  would have been recognized in and in prior years as depreciation on these properties had the disposal group been continuously classified as held and used 
facilities purchased and leased to legend healthcare in and increased depreciation expense by  interest expense related to our borrowings on a bank credit facility to fund new real estate and loan investments 
upfront fees and other loan related costs are amortized over the term of the credit facility 
the  decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement increased interest expense in since the agreement  which was terminated in  did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
in  adjustments totaling  reflecting the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge were recorded in other comprehensive income and not as a component of operations as the new interest rate swap qualified for hedge accounting 
an increase in interest payments and loan cost amortization of  resulted from expanded borrowings  offset by a lower libor underlying our floating rate debt in we expect to fund future healthcare real estate investments with borrowings from our bank credit facility and possibly longer term us government agency debt  thereby increasing our interest expense 
our net loan and realty recoveries of  in reflect a recovery of  on mortgage notes receivable  net of the seniortrust mortgage note impairment of  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
nhi continuing collection history with seniortrust  and the deterioration of the financial condition and creditworthiness of the borrower indicated that the carrying value of the mortgage note receivable was not recoverable 
share based compensation expense decreased in based upon lower stock volatility which is a key input to the black scholes pricing model for determining the market value of our stock options granted to directors and employees 
the value of the options is expensed over the vesting period of the individual grants 
investment and other gains in includes income of  related to an equity participation formula as part of a mortgage note payoff in december from one of our borrowers 
one of our subsidiaries reached a settlement regarding the final tax return for the operations acquired through foreclosure  and agreed to settle a claim for personal injury in relation to a matter which arose prior to our acquisition of the subsidiary

table of contents funds from operations our funds from operations ffo for the year ended december  increased  or over the same period in our normalized ffo for the year ended december  increased  or over the same period in  primarily as the result of the impact of our new real estate investments funded in and ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and applied by us  is net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  if any 
diluted ffo per common share assumes the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock using the treasury stock method 
normalized ffo excludes from ffo certain items which  due to their infrequent or unpredictable nature  may create some difficulty in comparing ffo for the current period to similar prior periods  and may include  but are not limited to  impairment of assets  gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities  recoveries of previous write downs  and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements for those agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
we believe that ffo and normalized ffo are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a reit 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a reit that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative  and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo 
the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our ffo may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
since other reits may not use our definition of ffo  caution should be exercised when comparing our company s ffo to that of other reits 
ffo in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap ffo does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity  and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the results of operations for facilities included in assets held for sale or facilities sold have been reported in the current and prior periods as discontinued operations 
the reclassifications to retrospectively reflect the disposition of these facilities had no impact on previously reported ffo

our revenues are generated primarily from long term investments in health care real estate and mortgage loans 
our lessees and borrowers are operators of health care facilities which are directly impacted by inflation in employee related costs and other facility expenses 
inflation has remained relatively low during recent periods 
there can be no assurance that future medicare  medicaid or private pay rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases 
certain of our leases require annual escalators in lease rates based upon increases in the revenues of the tenants

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately  of variable rate indebtedness excludes  of variable rate debt that has been hedged through an interest rate swap contract and on our mortgage and other notes receivable 
the unused portion  at december  of our credit facility  should it be drawn upon  is subject to variable rates 

table of contents interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and loans receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated 
however  interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments 
conversely  changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows  but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments 
assuming a basis point increase or decrease in the interest rate related to variable rate debt  and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december   net interest expense would increase or decrease annually by approximately  or 
per common share on a diluted basis 
we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivatives are included in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value 
we may engage in hedging strategies to manage our exposure to market risks in the future  depending on an analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our debt dollar amounts in thousands december  december  balance of total rate balance of total rate fixed rate unsecured year term loan variable rate secured mortgage loan unsecured year term loan unsecured revolving credit facility total is weighted average rate the fixed rate debt in the table above reflects the effect of a  notional amount interest rate swap with an april maturity that effectively converts variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
to highlight the sensitivity of this fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects on fair value fv assuming a parallel shift of basis points bps in market interest rates for a contract with similar maturities as of december  dollar amounts in thousands balance fair value fv reflecting change in interest rates fixed rate bps bps unsecured year term loan the change in fair value of our fixed rate debt was due primarily to the overall change in interest rates 
at december   the fair value of our mortgage loans receivable  discounted for estimated changes in the risk free rate  was approximately  a basis point increase in market rates would decrease the estimated fair value of our mortgage loans by approximately  while a basis point decrease in such rates would increase their estimated fair value by approximately  equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
we account for our investments in marketable securities  with a fair value of  at december   as available for sale securities 
increases and decreases in the fair market value of our investments in other marketable securities are unrealized gains and losses that are presented as a component of other comprehensive income 
the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk 
we monitor our investments in marketable securities to consider evidence of whether any portion of our original investment is likely not to be recoverable  at which time we would record an impairment charge to operations 
a hypothetical change in quoted market prices would result in a related  change in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities
