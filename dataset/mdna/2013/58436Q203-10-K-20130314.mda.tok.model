overview we are a medical technology and therapeutics company  developing an innovative and proprietary platform technology offering what we believe to be a novel approach for the billion protein therapeutics market 
our biopump platform technology is designed to provide sustained protein therapy to treat a range of chronic diseases and conditions 
since our inception on january   we have focused our efforts on research and development and clinical trials and have received no revenue from product sales 
we have funded our operations principally through equity and debt financings  participation from the office of the chief scientist ocs in israel and a collaborative agreement 
our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company  developing the biopump platform technology and its applications  developing and initiating clinical trials for our product candidates  and improving and maintaining our patent portfolio 
we have generated significant losses to date  and we expect to continue to generate losses as we progress towards the commercialization of our product candidates 
we have incurred net losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and approximately million for the period from inception through december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable  if at all 
although we have not yet generated revenues from product sales  we have generated income from partnering on development programs and we expect to expand our partnering activity 
in  we signed a preclinical development and option agreement with baxter healthcare  a market leader in the field of hemophilia  representing our first collaboration agreement for the biopump platform technology 
the agreement was extended in and pursuant to this agreement  the healthcare company provided funding for preclinical development of our biopump platform technology to produce and deliver the clotting protein factor viii for the sustained treatment of hemophilia  which we call the hemodure biopump 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we received million 
the agreement  as extended  expired on september  and equity offerings on april   we completed the united states initial public offering ipo of our common stock and redeemable common stock purchase warrants  both listed on the nyse amex 
we issued  shares of common stock  including  shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at a price of per share and redeemable common stock purchase warrants to purchase  shares including  warrants pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at a price of per warrant for total gross proceeds of million  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of approximately million 
on the closing date of the ipo april   million of convertible debentures issued in the debentures were automatically converted at a conversion price of per share of common stock into an aggregate  shares of common stock and we issued year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share in connection with the conversion of the debentures 
on the same date  million of convertible debentures issued in the debentures were automatically converted at a conversion price of per share of common stock into an aggregate  shares of common stock 
an additional  share of common stock were issued to the holders of the debentures in november to compensate the debenture holders for a minor portion of the interest which had been accrued but not paid at the time of conversion 
in connection with our ipo  the exercise price of certain warrants and options which were initially issued with round down protection mechanism were adjusted based upon the share value as determined in the ipo 
on june   we completed a private placement transaction in which we issued an aggregate of  units with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock 
the warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were issued with an exercise price of per share  first became exercisable on december  which  if all were exercised in full  would result in the issuance of  shares of common stock due to the rounding of fractional shares and will expire on june  in addition  warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock having an exercise price of per share were issued to the placement agent  first became exercisable on december  and will expire on june  each unit was sold for a purchase price of for total gross proceeds of approximately million  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting private placement fees of million and other offering costs of million 
financial operations overview research and development expense research and development expense consists of i internal costs associated with our development activities  ii payments we make to third party contract research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  and consultants  iii technology and intellectual property license costs  iv manufacturing development costs  v personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in product development  vi activities related to regulatory filings and the advancement of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and vii facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent  facility maintenance  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
conducting a significant amount of development is central to our business model 
through december   we incurred approximately million in gross research and development expenses since our inception on january  product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development  primarily due to the significantly increased size and duration of the clinical trials 
we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future in order to complete development of our two most advanced product candidates  the epodure biopump and the infradure biopump  and our earlier stage research and development projects including our hemodure biopump 
the following table summarizes the percentages of our gross research and development expenses related to our two most advanced product candidates and other projects 
the percentages summarized in the following table reflect expenses directly attributable to each development candidate  which are tracked on a project basis 
a portion of our internal costs  including indirect costs relating to our product candidates  are not tracked on a project basis and are allocated based on management s estimate 
year ended december  period from january  inception through december  epodure biopump infradure biopump hemodure biopump other product candidates the process of conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate s early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability 
as a result of these uncertainties  together with the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
we are currently focused on developing our two most advanced product candidates  the epodure biopump and the infradure biopump  as well as our hemodure biopump and associated devices for implementing the platform technology 
research and development expenses are shown net of participation by third parties 
the excess of the recognized amount received from the healthcare company over the amount of research and development expenses incurred during the period for the collaboration agreement is recognized as other income within operating income 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including stock based compensation expense  for persons serving as our directors and in our executive  finance and accounting functions 
other general and administrative expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  costs associated with industry and trade shows  and professional fees for legal services and accounting services 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we add personnel 
since our inception on january  through december   we spent approximately million on general and administrative expense 
other income we have not generated any product revenue since our inception  but  in connection with our first collaboration agreement  we received million from baxter healthcare through december  of which million has been recognized as other income 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and funding from the israeli ocs 
if our product development efforts result in clinical success  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of any of our products  we would expect to generate revenue from sales or licenses of any such products 
financial income and expense financial expense consists primarily of interest and amortization of beneficial conversion feature of convertible note  convertible debentures valuations  warrant valuations and interest incurred on debentures 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
results of operations for the years ended december  and research and development expenses gross research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  increasing from million in due to an increase in the use of materials and sub contractors in connection with our ongoing phase ii epodure clinical trial in israel  the preparations for the infradure trial in israel  and the phase ii epodure clinical trial in the u 
s and ongoing method development  as well as an increase in research and development personnel 
research and development expenses  net for the year ended december  were million  increasing from million in the increase in the research and development expenses  net was due to the increase in gross research and development expenses as detailed above  which were partially offset by participation by the ocs of million in compared with million in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  increasing from million in primarily due to stock based compensation expenses related to equity granted to the chairman of the board upon his appointment in june  increased legal fees and professional services and increased activities in the united states 
financial income and expenses financial expenses for year ended december  were million  increasing from million in this increase of million was mainly due to the change in valuation of the warrant liability during the year ended december  due to the rise in the market price of our common stock as compared to the prior period 
financial income for the year ended december  was de minimis  decreasing from million for the same period in the financial income of approximately million in was primarily due to the change in valuation of the warrant liability due to the decrease in the market price of our common stock as compared to the prior period 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have financed our operations primarily through a combination of equity  debt issues and grants from the ocs and other third parties 
we recorded million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  and million from inception through december   from the ocs in development grants 
in the year ended december   options and warrants were exercised in consideration of million and  shares of common stock were issued upon such exercise 
in the year ended december   options and warrants were exercised in consideration of million and  shares of common stock were issued upon such exercise 
on april   we completed our ipo in the united states of our common stock and redeemable common stock purchase warrants which are both listed on the nyse amex 
we issued  shares of common stock  including  shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at a price of per share and redeemable common stock purchase warrants to purchase  shares  including  warrants pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at a price of per warrant for total gross proceeds of million or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of approximately million 
on the closing date of the ipo april   million of debentures were automatically converted at a conversion price of per share of common stock into an aggregate amount of  shares and we issued year warrants to purchase  shares at an initial exercise price of per share in connection with the conversion of the debentures 
on the same date  million of debentures were automatically converted at a conversion price of per share into an aggregate amount of  shares 
an additional  shares of common stock were issued to holders of the debentures in november to compensate the debenture holders for a minor portion of the interest to compensate the debenture holders for a minor portion of the interest which had been accrued but not paid at the time of conversion 
on june   we completed a private placement transaction in which we issued an aggregate of  units with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock 
the warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were issued with an exercise price of per share and became exercisable on december  which  if all were exercised in full  would result in the issuance of  shares of common stock due to the rounding of fractional shares and will expire on june  in addition  warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock having an exercise price of per share were issued to the placement agent  became exercisable on december  and will expire on june  each unit was sold for a purchase price of for total gross proceeds of approximately million  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting private placement fees of million and other offering costs of million 
cash flows we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and million at december  the increase in our cash balance during was primarily the result of the private placement transaction completed in june  proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants and grants from the israeli ocs 
net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  primarily reflected our cash expenses for our operations 
our cash used in investing activities relates mainly to our purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december  were primarily the result of the private placement of common stock and warrants in june from which the net proceeds were approximately million 
our cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december  were primarily the result of the ipo from which the net proceeds were approximately million 
funding requirements we expect to enter into licensing or other commercialization agreements for all or parts of applications of our biopump platform technology to fund our continuing operations 
if we are unable to enter into such agreements on terms acceptable to us  we will continue to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur increasing research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials  as we further develop the epodure biopump  the infradure biopump and the hemodure biopump 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff  add infrastructure  and incur additional costs related to being a public company in the united states  including investor relations programs  and increased professional fees 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the acquisition of licenses to new products or compounds  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing  and our success in developing markets for our product candidates 
on february   we completed a registered public offering of  shares of common stock and  series a warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the shares of common stock and series a warrants were sold together as a fixed combination  each consisting of one share of common stock and one series a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  at a public offering price of per combination  less the underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we granted the underwriters the option to purchase  at the same price  an aggregate of up to an additional  shares of common stock and or an additional  series a warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock as may be necessary to cover over allotments made in connection with the offering  which  to date  has not been exercised 
the common stock and or series a warrants purchased under this option may be sold either together or separately in any combination to be determined by the underwriters 
without taking into account any revenue we may receive as a result of licensing or other commercialization agreements we are pursuing  we believe that the net proceeds we received from this public offering will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
we do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from the sale of products for at least five years  however  we do intend to seek licensing or other commercialization agreements similar to our agreement relating to the development of our hemodure biopump 
we anticipate that the funds received as a result of such agreements may be sufficient to fund our operations in the future 
in the absence of additional funding or adequate funding from commercialization agreements  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several quarters and years 
absent significant corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings or debt financings in the near term 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate  and we may decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a bank credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  if convertible  could result in dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
our plans include seeking additional investments and commercial agreements to continue our operations 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise the necessary capital and or reach such commercial agreements to continue our planned research and development activities 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
while our significant account policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
convertible debentures we irrevocably elected to initially and subsequently measure the convertible debentures issued in and entirely at fair value  in accordance with accounting standards codification no 
as a result  we did not separate the embedded derivative instrument from the host contract and account for it as a derivative instrument 
the convertible debentures were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date  and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of financial income expense  net in the statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of these convertible debentures at the respective balance sheet dates using the binomial option pricing model 
we used a number of assumptions to estimate the fair value  including the remaining contractual terms of the convertible debentures  risk free interest rates  expected dividend yield and expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock 
during the year ended december   we recorded financial expense of million to reflect the increase in the fair value of the convertible debentures 
we did not record any comparable expense during the year ended december   as all of our convertible debentures were converted into common stock in connection with our ipo and are no longer outstanding 
liability in respect of warrants in we issued warrants with an exercise price denominated in british pounds sterling which differs from the functional currency we use 
in addition  the exercise price of such warrants is subject to downward adjustment 
in addition  in and  we issued warrants that included price protection in the event of sales of securities below the then current exercise price 
in accordance with accounting standards codification no 
i  we classified these warrants as a liability at their fair value 
the warrants liability will be remeasured at each reporting period until exercised or expired 
the decrease in the fair value of the warrants during the year ended december  of million  and the increase in the fair value of the warrants during the year ended december  of  are reported in the statements of operations as financial income and expense  respectively 
we estimate the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using the binomial option pricing model 
we use a number of assumptions to estimate the fair value  including the remaining contractual terms of the warrants  risk free interest rates  expected dividend yield and expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock 
these assumptions could differ significantly in the future  thus resulting in variability of the fair value which would impact the results of operations in the future 
stock based compensation we account for stock options according to the accounting standards codification no 
asc compensation stock compensation 
under asc  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period on a straight line basis 
we account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis using an option pricing method in accordance with asc the initial non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting are revalued at the end of each reporting period based upon the change in the fair value of the options and amortized to consulting expense over the related vesting period 
for the purpose of valuing options and warrants granted to our employees  non employees and directors and officers during the years ended december  and  we used the binomial options pricing model 
to determine the risk free interest rate  we utilized the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term consistent with the expected term of our awards 
we estimated the expected life of the options granted based on anticipated exercises in the future periods assuming the success of our business model as currently forecast 
the expected dividend yield reflects our current and expected future policy for dividends on our common stock 
the expected stock price volatility for our stock options was calculated by examining historical volatilities for publicly traded industry peers as we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock 
we will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions as more historical data for our common stock becomes available 
given the senior nature of the roles of our employees  directors and officers  we currently estimate that we will experience no forfeitures for those options currently outstanding 
off balance sheet arrangements pursuant to our license agreement with yissum research development company of the hebrew university yissum  yissum granted us a license of certain patents for commercial development  production  sublicense and marketing of products to be based on its know how and research results 
in consideration  we agreed to pay yissum the following amounts  provided  however  that the total aggregate payment of royalties and sublicense fees by us to yissum shall not exceed million non refundable license fee of million to be paid in three installments  as follows o million when the accrued investments in us by any third party after may  equal at least million paid in  o million when the accrued investments in us by any third party after may  equal at least million paid in second quarter of  and o million when the accrued investments in us by any third party after may  equal at least million paid in april  royalties at a rate of of net sales of product incorporating the licensed technology  and sublicense fees at a rate of of sublicense considerations received by us 
the yissum license will expire upon the later of the twentieth anniversary of our first commercial sale of products utilizing the licensed technology and the expiration of the last yissum patent licensed to us  which is expected to be approximately july in  we signed an agreement with baylor college of medicine bcm whereby bcm granted us a non exclusive worldwide license to use  market  sell  lease and import certain technology bcm technology  by way of any product process or service that incorporates  utilizes or is made with the use of the bcm technology 
in consideration we agreed to pay bcm the following amounts a one time  non refundable license fee of  which was paid in an annual non refundable maintenance fee of  a one time milestone payment of  upon fda clearance or equivalent of clearance for therapeutic use as of december   we have not achieved fda clearance  and an installment of  upon our executing any sublicenses in respect of the bcm technology 
all payments to bcm are recorded as research and development expenses 
the license agreement will expire unless terminated earlier for default or by us at our discretion on the first day following the tenth anniversary of our first commercial sale of licensed products 
after termination  we will have a perpetual  royalty free license to the bcm technology 
under agreements with the ocs in israel regarding research and development projects  our israeli subsidiary is committed to pay royalties to the ocs at rates between and of the income resulting from this research and development  at an amount not to exceed the amount of the grants received by our subsidiary as participation in the research and development program  plus interest at libor 
the obligation to pay these royalties is contingent on actual income and in the absence of such income no payment is required 
as of december   the aggregate contingent liability amounted to approximately million 
pursuant to an agreement we entered into on february  effective as of january   the regents of the university of michigan michigan have granted a worldwide license for patent rights relating to certain uses of variants of clotting factor viii 
the license agreement covers a portfolio of two issued and three pending patents 
in consideration we agreed to pay michigan the following amounts an initial license fee of  which was paid in  an annual license fee in arrears of  rising to  following the grant by us of a sublicense or if sooner from the sixth anniversary of the license agreement  staged milestone payments of  in aggregate  of which  will be recoupable against royalties  royalties at an initial rate of of net sales  reducing by a percentage point at predetermined thresholds to upon cumulative net sales exceeding million  sublicense fees at an initial rate of of sublicensing revenues  reducing by a percentage point at predetermined thresholds to upon cumulative sublicensing revenues exceeding million  and patent maintenance costs 
the exclusive worldwide license from michigan is expected to expire in upon the expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights licensed 
as of december   we have paid the initial license fee and patent maintenance costs and an annual license fee 
no royalties or sublicense fees have yet accrued with respect to any of these three licenses 
additionally  we cannot estimate when we will begin selling any products that would require us to make any such royalty payments 
whether we will be obligated to make royalty payments in the future is subject to the success of our product development efforts and  accordingly  is inherently uncertain 
subsequent events in january  the company issued a total of  shares of common stock to two consultants 
also in january  the company granted options to purchase  shares of common stock and  shares of restricted common stock to each of five non executive directors of the company 
these shares of common stock are restricted in that they may not be disposed of and are not entitled to dividends 
the restrictions with respect to these shares lapsed with respect to of these shares the day after the grant and will lapse with respect to the remaining one year from the grant date 
all of the options are for a term of years  vest in three equal installments and have an exercise price of 
these options and restricted common stock were granted under the stock incentive plan

on february   we completed a registered public offering of  shares of common stock and  series a warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the shares of common stock and series a warrants were sold together as a fixed combination  each consisting of one share of common stock and one series a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  at a public offering price of per combination  less the underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we granted the underwriters the option to purchase  at the same price  an aggregate of up to an additional  shares of common stock and or an additional  series a warrant to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock as may be necessary to cover over allotments made in connection with the offering
