item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position at september  and  and our results of operations for each of the fiscal years for the three year period ended september   and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this form k 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
see forward looking statements 
overview financial and operating results for the fiscal year ended september   include record operating revenues totaling  million on  operating days as compared to operating revenues of million on  operating days for the fiscal year ended september   record net income of million as compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended september   diluted earnings per share of as compared to diluted earnings per share of for the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities of million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended september   debt to capitalization ratio of at september  market outlook industry conditions the level of activity in the offshore drilling industry  which affects the drilling sector s profitability  is highly correlated to the price of oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas 
the price of oil is determined by the balance between global and or regional supply and demand 
the state of the global economy and associated degree of economic growth are important factors in determining the level of demand for commodities  including oil and natural gas 
the strength and sustainability of the global economic recovery remains uncertain  with economic growth rates slowing in most major economies 
this is partially offset by improving economic growth in the us during the year 
in addition  geopolitical developments  mainly in north africa and the middle east  have resulted in oil supply disruptions  strengthening international crude oil prices 
although oil prices have continued to be volatile  they remain relatively strong compared to historical price levels  with the price of brent sustained above per barrel 
while future oil prices are difficult to predict  we believe that the current oil price levels are sufficient to support continued strong demand for offshore drilling services 
global economic issues have not meaningfully impacted demand for offshore drilling services as rig demand generally remains strong in all major global markets and across most rig types 
strong demand for offshore drilling rigs  as evidenced by high levels of marketed rigs under contract  has led to sustained favorable day rates in the ultra deepwater segment and increasing day rates in the jackup segment 
the deepwater segment has recently seen a decrease in marketed utilization which may lead to lower day rates in the future 
we continue to see variability in day rates primarily due to rig capabilities and age  followed by rig location and contract term 
the pace of new ultra deepwater rig orders has declined dramatically with only additional floater orders being placed in as compared to orders in access to equity and debt capital  combined with shortages in highly skilled offshore and onshore personnel  continue to provide a significant entry barrier for the ultra deepwater rig market 
as a result  the majority of ultra deepwater drilling rigs currently under construction have been ordered by established drilling companies 
in contrast to the ultra deepwater market  high specification jackups have been ordered since january  thirty of these rigs are being constructed in chinese shipyards  indicating a shifting trend towards lower cost shipyards with large back end weighted payment terms 
globally  the strength in all regional jackup markets is being driven by operator demand for newer  more capable rigs to replace the existing old and less capable fleet 
the high level of drilling activity  together with the backlog of rigs under construction  is creating capacity constraints in the global offshore rig equipment supply chain 
as a result  equipment delivery lead times remain challenging which is leading to delayed rig deliveries 
additionally  the industry is facing a shortage of skilled personnel  which could increase operating costs in certain operating areas in the future 
ultra deepwater and deepwater rig markets industry wide  the percentage of marketed ultra deepwater rigs under contract remains at approximately  while the percentage of marketed deepwater rigs under contract remains at approximately 
in addition  all newbuild floaters estimated to be delivered throughout the remainder of calendar year are currently contracted 
some recent contract fixtures suggest that the day rates and demand for deepwater rigs and older  less capable ultra deepwater rigs may be impacted negatively by the increased supply of newer ultra deepwater rigs  with the older  less capable rigs having to price more aggressively to retain or attract demand by operators 
as of november   there were ultra deepwater drillships and semisubmersibles under construction for delivery through may this number includes ultra deepwater rigs under long term contracts with petrobras and primarily being constructed in shipyards located in brazil 
of the remaining ultra deepwater rigs under construction  are currently uncontracted 
our ultra deepwater rig and deepwater rigs the atwood condor  an ultra deepwater  dynamically positioned semisubmersible  is operating in the us gulf of mexico and is contracted through november the atwood osprey  an ultra deepwater semisubmersible  is operating offshore australia and is contracted through may the atwood eagle and atwood falcon  both deepwater semisubmersibles  are operating offshore australia and are contracted through june and november  respectively 
the atwood hunter  a deepwater semisubmersible  is operating offshore equatorial guinea and is contracted through february the atwood advantage  atwood achiever  atwood admiral and atwood archer are dp dynamically positioned  dual derrick  ultra deepwater drillships rated to operate in water depths up to  feet  and are currently under construction at the dsme shipyard in south korea 
these drillships will have enhanced technical capabilities  including two seven ram bops  three ton knuckle boom cranes  a ton active heave tree running knuckle boom crane and person accommodations 
the atwood advantage  atwood achiever  atwood admiral and atwood archer are scheduled to be delivered in november  june  march and december  respectively  at a total cost  including project management  drilling and handling tools and spares  of approximately million each 
upon delivery from the shipyard  the atwood advantage will mobilize to the eastern mediterranean sea to commence a three year drilling program 
the atwood achiever will mobilize to morocco to commence a three year drilling program upon its delivery from the shipyard 
although  presently  we do not have drilling contracts for the atwood admiral or the atwood archer  we expect that the long term demand for ultra deepwater drilling services in established and emerging basins should provide us with opportunities to contract these two rigs prior to their respective delivery dates 
we have an option to build an additional ultra deepwater drillship with dsme that expires march  at this time  we have not made any determination as to whether the option will be exercised 
in determining whether to exercise the option  we will consider several factors  including oil and natural gas prices  the magnitude of our contract drilling revenue backlog  current and prospective supply and demand dynamics of the ultra deepwater drilling market  current ultra deepwater contract day rates  newbuild drillship construction prices and our ability to incur debt financing to finance a portion of the construction contract 
jackup rig market bifurcation in day rates and utilization between high specification jackups and standard jackups continues to characterize contracting activity in the jackup market 
we expect this bifurcation trend to become more pronounced in the future 
the percentage of marketed high specification jackup rigs ie  rigs equal to or greater than foot water depth capability under contract is approximately as compared to for the remainder of the global jackup fleet 
despite the expected increase in global jackup supply due to the continued delivery of high specification newbuild rigs through the end of  we expect demand for high specification jackup rigs will remain elevated as operators continue to prefer contracting newer  more capable rigs for their drilling programs 
as a result of newbuild jackup construction programs initiated in and continuing through  the jackup supply continues to increase 
as of november   there were newbuild jackup rigs under construction 
twenty two of these jackups are scheduled for delivery during the remainder of  of which six are contracted and six are not considered high specification 
the remaining rigs are scheduled for delivery in through this increase in the marketed supply of high specification jackups may exceed customer demand leading to lower day rates in the future 
our jackup rigs the atwood mako and the atwood orca  both high specification jackups  are operating offshore thailand and are contracted through september and may  respectively 
the atwood manta  a high specification jackup identical to the atwood mako and the atwood orca  is operating offshore malaysia and is contracted through december the atwood aurora  a high specification jackup  is operating offshore west africa and is contracted through may the atwood beacon  a high specification jackup  is operating in the mediterranean sea and is contracted into november the vicksburg  a standard jackup  is operating offshore thailand and is contracted through december on october   we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of the vicksburg to gulf drilling international ltd qsc for a sales price of million 
the closing of the sale is expected to occur in january following the completion of the unit s contract with its current customer  cec international  ltd 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions 
idled rigs the atwood southern cross and seahawk were idle as of september  we anticipate that the atwood southern cross will not return to service during fiscal year due to the lack of sufficient continuous demand  and thus  we are not actively marketing the rig at this time 
on october   we entered into a stock purchase agreement for the sale of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries which is the owner of our semisubmersible tender assist drilling rig  the seahawk  to delta group fze for a sales price of million 
as of september   the carrying value of the rig and its related inventory approximates its sales price 
the closing of the sale is expected to occur in november subject to customary closing conditions 
contract backlog we maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues 
our contract backlog at september  was approximately billion  representing a increase compared to our contract backlog of billion at september  we calculate our contract backlog by multiplying the day rate under our drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract  assuming full utilization 
the calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation  customer reimbursables and bonuses 
the amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different from amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to a lack of predictability of various factors  including newbuild rig delivery dates  unscheduled repairs  maintenance requirements  weather delays and other factors 
such factors may result in lower applicable day rates than the full contractual day rate and or delays in receiving the full contractual operating rate 
in addition  under certain circumstances  our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts 
see item a  risk factors our business may experience reduced profitability if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our drilling contracts of this form k

fiscal year included  operating days versus  operating days in fiscal year a comparative analysis of revenues for fiscal years and is as follows revenues in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood condor atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon atwood mako atwood manta atwood orca vicksburg reimbursable the increase in revenues for the atwood condor for the current fiscal year is due to the rig operating for the full fiscal year after commencing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal year when it was mobilizing from the shipyard in singapore to the us gulf of mexico 
the increase in revenues for the atwood falcon for the current fiscal year is due to a higher day rate contract offshore australia compared to the prior fiscal year when the rig was working at a lower day rate offshore malaysia  in addition to the rig undergoing a shipyard upgrade project from february to may during which time days at zero rate were incurred 
the decrease in revenues for the atwood hunter for the current fiscal year is primarily due to the rig working at a lower day rate offshore west africa under a new drilling contract as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues for the atwood beacon for the current fiscal year is primarily due to the rig working on a higher day rate contract offshore israel as compared to the prior fiscal year when the rig was working at a lower day rate offshore south america 
the atwood mako  the atwood manta and the atwood orca were delivered from the shipyard and commenced drilling operations offshore thailand in september  december and may  respectively  and thus earned little to no revenue during the prior fiscal year while the rigs were predominantly under construction 
the increase in revenues for the vicksburg for the current fiscal year is primarily due to the rig working for the same customer on a higher day rate contract offshore thailand 
reimbursable revenues are primarily driven by clients and contracts and are dependent on the timing of the client requests and work performed 
changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the increase in reimbursable revenues for the current fiscal year is primarily due to the growth of our fleet as a result of the delivery of four newly constructed rigs and commencement of operations in july through may drilling costs drilling costs for fiscal year increased million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
fiscal year included  operating days versus  operating days in fiscal year a comparative analysis of drilling costs for fiscal years and is as follows drilling costs in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood condor atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon atwood mako atwood manta atwood orca vicksburg reimbursable other the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood condor for the current fiscal year is due to the rig operating for the full fiscal year after commencing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal year when it was mobilizing from the shipyard in singapore to the us gulf of mexico 
the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood eagle for the current fiscal year is primarily due to the rig undergoing regulatory inspections  planned maintenance  and upgrades in december the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood falcon for the current fiscal year is primarily the result of working offshore australia  which has significantly higher personnel costs as compared to working offshore malaysia in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in contract drilling costs for the atwood aurora for the current fiscal year is primarily attributable to amortization charges relating to mobilization to west africa recorded in the prior fiscal year as compared to none in the current fiscal year since the rig has continued to operate in west africa 
the atwood mako  the atwood manta and the atwood orca were delivered from the shipyard and commenced drilling operations offshore thailand in september  december  and may  respectively  and thus incurred little to no contract drilling costs during the prior fiscal year while the rigs were predominantly under construction 
reimbursable costs are primarily driven by clients and contracts and are dependent on the timing of the client requests and work performed 
changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the increase in reimbursable costs for the current fiscal year is primarily due to the growth of our fleet as a result of the delivery of four newly constructed rigs and commencement of operations in july through may depreciation depreciation expense for the fiscal year increased million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
a comparative analysis of depreciation expense by rig for fiscal years and is as follows depreciation expense in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood condor atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon atwood mako atwood manta atwood orca vicksburg other the increase in depreciation for the atwood condor for the current fiscal year is due to the rig being placed into service at the beginning of july and incurring only three months of depreciation expense while mobilizing in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in depreciation for the atwood falcon for the current fiscal year is primarily due to certain upgrades made to the rig during the shipyard project that was completed in may the increase in depreciation for the atwood mako  the atwood manta and the atwood orca for the current fiscal year is due to the rigs being placed into service in september  december and may  respectively  and incurring little to no depreciation expense in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in other depreciation expense is due to the acquisition of enterprise resource planning business management software and implementation on october  at our headquarters in houston as well as all our supporting offices 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased approximately million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher personnel related costs  including an increase in headcount  and higher professional fees to support our larger fleet 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest interest expense  net of capitalized interest for fiscal year increased approximately million  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher outstanding debt and a higher weighted average borrowing cost 
income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal year  which is consistent with the prior fiscal year 
the prior fiscal period included the benefit from the favorable resolution of a prior period tax examination 
absent this benefit  our effective tax rate for fiscal year is lower than the prior fiscal year due to the change in the geographical mix of income 
our effective tax rates were lower than the us statutory rate of as a result of working in certain lower tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues revenues for fiscal year increased million  or  compared to fiscal year fiscal year included  operating days versus  operating days in fiscal year a comparative analysis of revenues for fiscal years and is as follows revenues in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood condor atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon atwood mako vicksburg reimbursable our newest ultra deepwater  semisubmersible drilling rig  the atwood condor  which commenced operations under its initial contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  earned mobilization revenue as it relocated from the shipyard in singapore to the us gulf of mexico 
the increase in revenues for the atwood osprey was due to the fact that the rig commenced drilling operations offshore australia in late may and thus did not earn a full year of revenue in fiscal year the rig continued on contract offshore australia for all of fiscal year the decrease in revenues for the atwood falcon was due to the rig working on a long term contract offshore malaysia for all of fiscal year this contract ended during the second quarter of fiscal year from february through may  the rig underwent a shipyard project in singapore for upgrades 
following completion of such upgrades  the rig relocated to work offshore australia and began operations in late may that continued through the end of fiscal year the increase in revenues for the atwood hunter was primarily due to out of service time related to a planned regulatory inspection during fiscal year compared to no out of service time during fiscal year the atwood hunter worked offshore west africa during both fiscal years and revenues for the atwood aurora increased as the rig was fully utilized during fiscal year working offshore west africa 
in fiscal year  the rig worked offshore egypt until completion of its contract commitment in may the contract was followed by a planned shipyard project through june  after which the rig was idle for most of the fourth quarter of fiscal year until it resumed work under a contract that commenced in september our newest active jackup drilling unit  the atwood mako  was delivered from the shipyard and commenced drilling operations in september offshore thailand  and thus earned no revenue in fiscal year reimbursable revenues are primarily driven by clients and contracts and are dependent on the timing of the client requests and work performed 
changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

no drilling costs were incurred in fiscal year while the rig was under construction 
the atwood osprey commenced drilling operations in may  incurring approximately four months of drilling costs in fiscal year as compared to a full twelve months of drilling costs in fiscal year while working offshore australia 
the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood falcon in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to increased maintenance activities during the shipyard project from february to may and the subsequent commencement of drilling operations offshore australia which has significantly higher personnel costs than costs for its previous contract offshore malaysia 
the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood hunter was due primarily to increased equipment related costs associated with maintenance projects and inspections as compared to fiscal year the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood aurora in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  was primarily attributable to increased costs for monthly amortization charges for mobilization to offshore west africa in fiscal year as well as lower operating expenses incurred at the end of fiscal year due to a planned shipyard project and substantial idle time prior to commencing its next contract offshore west africa 
the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood beacon was primarily due to increased equipment related costs associated with maintenance projects and inspections incurred while the rig relocated from south america to the mediterranean sea during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the atwood mako was delivered from the shipyard and commenced drilling operations in thailand in september no drilling costs were incurred in fiscal year while the rig was under construction

other  net the decrease in other expenses is primarily due to a million charge related to an impairment of certain of our idled equipment during fiscal year income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year effective tax rate of 
the lower effective income tax was primarily due to the favorable resolution of prior period tax examinations 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
at any time  we may require a significant portion of our cash on hand for working capital and other purposes 
during the year ended september   we relied principally on our cash flows from operations  cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of additional senior notes described below to meet liquidity needs and fund our cash requirements including our capital expenditures of million 
working capital increased from million as of september  to million as of september  due to an increase in our accounts receivable and inventory which is attributable to our larger fleet 
net cash from operating activities for the year ended september  was million  which compared to million for the year ended september  the increase in cash from operating activities in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in net income 
to date  general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating revenues or expenses 
senior notes due in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due the senior notes 
we received net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility as defined below 
on june   we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount the additional notes of our senior notes 
the two issuances of senior notes together form a single series under the indenture with an aggregate principal amount of million 
we received net proceeds from the additional notes  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  of approximately million 
this amount includes million of accrued interest due from february  through the date of issuance 
the net proceeds also include a premium of million to be amortized through maturity on february  the receipt of a premium results in an effective interest rate of for the additional notes and an effective interest rate of on the aggregate principal amount of million 
the senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are not currently guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
interest is payable on the senior notes semi annually in arrears 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains provisions that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  sell assets  make investments  create liens  enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
many of these restrictions will terminate if the senior notes become rated investment grade 
the indenture governing the senior notes also contains customary events of default  including payment defaults  defaults for failure to comply with other covenants in the indenture  cross acceleration and entry of final judgments in excess of million  and certain events of bankruptcy  in certain cases subject to notice and grace periods 
we are required to offer to repurchase the senior notes in connection with specified change in control events or with excess proceeds of asset sales not applied for permitted purposes 
at any time prior to february   we may  on any one or more occasions  redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price set forth in the indenture governing the senior notes 
at any time prior to february   we may  on any one or more occasions  redeem the senior notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make whole premium 
on and after february   we may  on any one or more occasions  redeem the senior notes in whole or in part at the redemption price set forth in the indenture governing the senior notes 
revolving credit facility as of september   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our five year aggregate billion senior secured revolving credit facility 
the original five year million senior secured revolving credit facility was entered into in may and matures in may the credit facility 
our wholly owned subsidiary  atwood offshore worldwide limited aowl  is the borrower under the credit facility  and we and certain of our other subsidiaries are guarantors under the facility 
except as described below  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin of 
currently  certain borrowings effectively bear interest at a fixed rate due to our interest rate swaps 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the average interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility was approximately per annum at september   after considering the impact of our interest rate swaps 
the credit facility also provides for the issuance  when requested  of standby letters of credit 
the credit facility has a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of million of the underlying commitment 
as of september   we had standby letters of credit issued in the aggregate amount of million 
in july  we and aowl amended the credit facility to  among other things  eliminate all scheduled commitment reductions totaling million under the credit facility 
in addition  aowl entered into an incremental commitment agreement further modifying the credit facility 
the incremental commitment agreement provides for an additional tranche of commitments and increases the amount of the credit facility by million to an aggregate of billion 
the maturity date of all borrowings under the credit facility remains may  borrowings under the incremental tranche of commitments bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to  based on our corporate credit ratings and a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the additional tranche 
in connection with the incremental commitment agreement  we mortgaged as additional collateral under the credit facility the atwood condor  as well as pledged the equity interests in our subsidiaries that own  directly or indirectly  the atwood condor 
no other terms of the credit facility were amended by the incremental commitment agreement  and all other terms and conditions of the credit facility  including the financial and other restrictive covenants set forth therein  are applicable to the incremental tranche of commitments 
subsequent to september   no additional borrowings were made under the credit facility 
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and the agreement by the lenders  the credit facility accordion may be exercised further to increase commitments by up to an additional million for a total commitment of up to billion 
the credit facility contains various financial covenants that impose a maximum leverage ratio of to  a debt to capitalization ratio of to  a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of to and a minimum collateral maintenance of of the aggregate amount outstanding under the credit facility 
in addition  the credit facility contains limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur liens  merge  consolidate or sell substantially all assets  pay dividends including restrictions on aowl ability to pay dividends to us  incur additional indebtedness  make advances  investments or loans  and transact with affiliates 
the credit facility also contains customary events of default  including but not limited to delinquent payments  bankruptcy filings  material adverse judgments  guarantees or security documents not being in full effect  non compliance with the employee retirement income security act of  cross defaults under other debt agreements  or a change of control 
the credit facility is secured primarily by first preferred mortgages on seven of our active drilling units the atwood aurora  the atwood beacon  the atwood eagle  the atwood falcon  the atwood hunter  the atwood osprey  and the atwood condor  as well as liens on the equity interests of our subsidiaries that own  directly or indirectly  such drilling units 
in addition  if we exercise the accordion feature and increase the total commitments  the credit facility requires that we provide a first preferred mortgage on the atwood mako and the atwood manta  as well as a lien on the equity interests of our subsidiaries that own  directly or indirectly  such rigs 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility at september   and we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance for the next fiscal year 
repurchase and retirement of common shares on may   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with helmerich payne international drilling co 
h p  a subsidiary of helmerich payne  inc  under which we agreed to repurchase  shares of our common stock from h p and to make a payment at closing to h p of million 
on june   we and h p amended the agreement to extend the closing date from june  to june  and to increase the amount to be paid at closing to h p by  the share repurchase closed on june  following the share repurchase  we canceled such shares 
h p is considered a related party as a member of our board of directors serves as the president and chief executive officer  as well as a director  of helmerich payne  inc capital expenditures our capital expenditures  including maintenance capital expenditures  for fiscal year totaled million 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures for fiscal year will be approximately million  substantially all of which is contractually committed 
these capital expenditures are expected to be funded with existing cash balances on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility including the additional million accordion 
as of september   we had expended approximately million on our four drilling units under construction at such time 
the expected remaining costs including firm commitments  project management  capitalized interest and drilling and handling tools and spares for our four drilling units under construction are as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal total we believe that we will be able to fund all additional construction costs with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which has provisions to increase the total commitment to billion as described above 
other from time to time  we may seek possible expansion and acquisition opportunities relating to our business  which may include the construction or acquisition of rigs or other businesses in addition to those described in this form k 
such determinations will depend on market conditions and opportunities existing at that time  including with respect to the market for drilling contracts and day rates and the relative costs associated with such expansions or acquisitions 
the timing  success or terms of any such efforts and the associated capital commitments are not currently known 
in addition to cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  we may seek to access the capital markets to fund such opportunities 
our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors  including  among others  our credit rating  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry 
in addition  we continually review the possibility of disposing of assets that we do not consider core to our long term business plan 
in addition  in the future  we may seek to redeploy our assets to more active regions if we have the opportunity to do so on attractive terms 
we frequently bid for or negotiate with customers regarding multi year contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
we expect to fund these opportunities primarily with cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments as of september  in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter total debt interest purchase commitments operating leases debt amounts include principal payments on the senior notes and credit facility and short term notes payable 
interest amounts include fixed interest payments on the senior notes and swaps assuming september  libor for floating rate as well as interest and commitment fees on the credit facility assuming september  libor for floating rate and the debt outstanding and the unused portion of the underlying commitment as of september  purchase commitment amounts include commitments related to our four drilling units under construction as of september  excludes project management  capitalized interest and drilling and handling tools and spares 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases 
our future operating lease payments would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we identify our most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition  deferred fees and costs  property and equipment  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we account for contract drilling revenue in accordance with the terms of the underlying drilling contract 
these contracts generally provide that revenue is earned and recognized on a daily rate ie day rate basis  and day rates are typically earned for a particular level of service over the life of a contract assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
day rate contracts can be performed for a specified period of time or the time required to drill a specified well or number of wells 
revenues from day rate contracts for drilling and other operations performed during the term of a contract including during mobilization are classified under contract drilling services 
fees received as compensation for the relocating drilling rigs from one major operating area to another  equipment and upgrade costs reimbursed by the customer  as well as receipt of advance billings of day rates are recognized as earned during the expected term of the related drilling contract  as are the day rates associated with such contracts 
however  fees received upon termination of a drilling contract are generally recognized as earned during the period termination occurs as the termination fee is usually conditional based on the occurrence of an event as defined in the drilling contract  such as not obtaining follow on work to the contract in progress or relocation beyond a certain distance when the contract is completed 
if receipt of such fees are not conditional  they will be recognized as earned on a straight line method over the expected term of the related drilling contract 
deferred costs we defer the mobilization costs relating to moving a drilling rig to a new area  which are incurred prior to the commencement of the drilling operations and customer requested equipment purchases that will revert to the customer at the end of the applicable drilling contract 
we amortize such costs on a straight line basis over the expected term of the applicable drilling contract 
contract revenues and drilling costs are reported in the consolidated statements of operations at their gross amounts 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost  reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
at september   the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled approximately billion  which represents approximately of our total assets 
the carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgments by management relative to the useful lives and salvage values of our units 
once rigs and related equipment are placed in service  they are depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  with depreciation discontinued only during the period when a drilling unit is out of service while undergoing a significant upgrade that extends its useful life 
the estimated useful lives of our drilling units and related equipment  including drill pipe  can range from years to years and our salvage values are generally estimated at of capitalized costs 
any future increases or decreases in our estimates of useful lives or salvage values will have the effect of decreasing or increasing future depreciation expense  respectively 
we evaluate our property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
in determining an asset fair value  we consider a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows  appraisals and current market value analysis 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
operations of our drilling equipment are subject to the offshore drilling requirements of oil and gas exploration and production companies and agencies of foreign governments 
these requirements are  in turn  subject to fluctuations in government policies  world demand and price for petroleum products  proved reserves in relation to such demand and the extent to which such demand can be met from onshore sources 
the critical estimates which result from these dynamics include projected utilization  day rates  and operating expenses  each of which impacts our estimated future cash flows 
over the last five years  our full utilization rate for all rigs has averaged approximately  however  if a drilling unit incurs significant idle time or receives day rates below operating costs  its carrying value could become impaired 
see item selected financial data for further discussion on the calculation of full utilization rates 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments used by management in the application of our property and equipment and asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments  especially those involving the useful lives of our rigs and vessels and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
income taxes we conduct operations and earn income in numerous foreign countries and are subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries  as well as united states federal and state tax laws 
at september   we have an approximate million net deferred income tax liability 
this balance reflects the application of our income tax accounting policies 
such accounting policies incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgments by management relative to the interpretation of applicable tax laws  the application of accounting standards  and future levels of taxable income 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments used by management in connection with accounting for income taxes reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations 
changes in these estimates  assumptions and judgments could result in materially different provisions for deferred and current income taxes 
a comprehensive model is used to account for uncertain tax positions  which includes consideration of how we recognize  measure  present and disclose uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on a tax return 
the income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities for an entity to provide enhanced disclosures that will enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity financial position 
further  in january  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities to address implementation issues and unintended consequences with regard to the scope of asu we adopted the amendments in both asu and asu effective january   with no material impact on our financial statements or disclosures in our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  other comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income requiring an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by respective line items of net income if required under gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income or by cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail for those amounts not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period 
we adopted the amendments in asu effective january   with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures in our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  liabilities topic obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date to provide guidance for the recognition  measurement  and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date 
this would include debt arrangements  other contractual obligations  and settled litigation and judicial rulings 
we will adopt the amendments in asu effective october  we do not expect that our adoption will have an impact on our financial statements or disclosures in our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
interest rate risk the provisions of our credit facility provide for a variable interest rate cost on our million outstanding as of september  however  we employed an interest rate risk management strategy that utilizes derivative instruments with respect to million of our debt as of september  in order to minimize or eliminate unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows arising from changes in  and volatility of  interest rates 
effectively  only million of our variable long term debt outstanding as of september  is subject to changes in interest rates 
thus  a change in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would have an immaterial impact on our annual earnings and cash flows 
foreign currency risk as a multinational company  we conduct business in numerous foreign countries 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
certain of our subsidiaries have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than our functional currency 
based on september  amounts  a decrease in the value of in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would not have a material effect to our annual earnings and cash flows 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at september  market risk our senior notes bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
fair value of our senior notes will fluctuate based on changes in prevailing market interest rates and market perceptions of our credit risk 
the fair value of our senior notes was approximately million at september   compared to the principal amount of million 
if prevailing market interest rates had been lower at september   the change in fair value of our senior notes would have been immaterial
