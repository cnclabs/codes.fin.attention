item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition proposed sale of shares to moishe gubin 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into an agreement with moishe gubin  the chairman of our board of directors  to sell  shares to mr 
gubin at a price of per share  or a total of million 
in march  the company and mr 
gubin amended this agreement to increase the number of shares to be purchased to  to decrease the price to per share and to extend the outside closing date to september  the company is seeking to complete the transaction with mr 
gubin in order to assist the bank in meeting the capital requirements of the consent order and to increase its lending and investment portfolio 
the amended transaction with mr 
gubin is subject to approval by the federal reserve board of governors and the ofr 
although mr 
gubin has filed the required applications with federal reserve and the ofr  together with several amendments  these agencies have not yet approved the applications 
at the time present  neither the company nor mr 
gubin is able to predict when or if the applications will be approved 
the amended transaction with mr 
gubin is also subject to approval by the shareholders of the company 
the company expects to submit the issue to the shareholders for approval at the company s annual meeting 
if the required regulatory approvals are received  the company would receive proceeds from the transaction of million 
the agreement terminates if the conditions are not fulfilled and the closing does not occur by september  substantially all the proceeds from the transaction will be utilized by the company to increase the capital of the bank 
as of march   the company had  outstanding shares of common stock  including  shares that were beneficially owned by mr 
gubin 
upon the issuance of  additional shares of company s common stock to mr 
gubin  and assuming no other issuance of shares of company common stock  mr 
gubin would own approximately  shares of the company s common stock  or of the total outstanding shares 
if the million proceeds of the transaction with mr 
gubin had been contributed to the bank as of december   the bank s tier leverage and total risk based capital ratios on a pro forma basis would have improved to and  respectively 
the actual improvement in the bank s capital ratios after the transaction of mr

the board has agreed to amend the terms of the transaction with mr 
gubin in order to reduce the price per share from per share to per share  and to increase the number of shares to be purchased from  shares to  shares 
the company has agreed to these changes because of the continuing losses incurred by the company in and the decrease of the company s book value per share from at december  to at december  the company agreed to increase the number of shares to be purchased in order to partially offset the decrease in the net proceeds of the sale to mr 
gubin

lending activities we offer real estate  commercial and consumer loans  to individuals and small businesses and other organizations that were located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in our market area 
our market area consists of the tri county area of broward  miami dade and palm beach counties 
our net loans at december  were million  or of total assets 
the interest rates we charge on loans varied with the degree of risk  maturity  and amount of the loan  and are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulations 
we have no foreign loans or loans for highly leveraged transactions 
our loan portfolio is concentrated in two major areas residential and commercial real estate loans 
as of december   of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by mortgages on real estate  of which approximately of the total loan portfolio was secured by one to four family residential properties 
our real estate loans are located primarily in our tri county market area 
our real estate loans are secured by mortgages and consist primarily of loans to individuals and businesses for the purchase or improvement of  or investment in  real estate 
these real estate loans were made at fixed or variable interest rates and are normally adjustable rate mortgages which adjust annually after the initial three to five year period 
our fixed rate loans generally are for terms of five years or less  and are repayable in monthly installments based on a maximum year amortization schedule 
loan originations are derived primarily from director and employee referrals  existing customers and direct marketing 
loan originations have also been derived from existing customers  and referrals from existing customers  and company directors and employees 
certain credit risks are inherent in making loans 
these include prepayment risks  risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral  risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions including interest rates  and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers 
a significant portion of our portfolio is collateralized by real estate in south florida  and we are susceptible to local economic downturns 
we attempt to minimize credit losses through various means 
on larger credits  we rely on the cash flow and assets of a debtor as the source of repayment as well as the value of the underlying collateral 
we also generally limit our loans to of the value of the underlying real estate collateral 
we generally charge a prepayment penalty if a loan is repaid within the first two to three years of origination to recover any fees we paid for the origination of the loan 
due to the effects of the current recession  our earnings have been materially affected by required provisions for loan losses  and to a lesser degree  reduced interest income and increased loan administration expenses  stemming primarily from deterioration in our commercial real estate and land loan portfolios 
for the two year period of october through september  due to the need for the bank to reduce its exposure to credit risk and preserve regulatory capital  we have limited our lending activities to restructuring  modifying  or extending existing loans and lending to purchasers of real estate properties owned by the bank 
since completion of the capital raise in the last quarter of  we have resumed lending activities 
deposit activities deposits are the major source of our funds for lending and other investment activities 
we consider the majority of our regular savings  demand  now  money market deposit accounts and cd under  to be core deposits 
these accounts comprised approximately of our total deposits at december  approximately of our deposits at december  were certificates of deposit 
generally  we attempt to maintain the rates paid on our deposits at a competitive level 
time deposits of  and over made up approximately of our total deposits at december  although these large deposits are not traditionally considered core deposits  the majority of these deposits have served as a stable source of funds in our targeted market 
the majority of our deposits are generated from broward county 
we have used brokered deposits to facilitate the funding of our mortgage lending activities in circumstances when larger than anticipated loan volumes occur and there is not enough time to fund the additional loan demand through traditional deposit solicitation 
the time frame from the initial order to the final funding of brokered deposits is generally one to three days 
the rates paid on these brokered deposits are typically equal to or slightly less than the high end of the interest rates in optimumbank competitive market area 
since december  we have no longer solicited or renewed existing brokered deposits due to regulatory restrictions 
brokered deposits amounted to and of our total deposits at december  and  respectively 
investments our investment securities portfolio was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of our total assets 
at december   approximately of this portfolio was invested in us government agency mortgage backed securities and of this portfolio was invested in private mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities generally have a shorter life than the stated maturity 
our investments are managed in relation to loan demand and deposit growth  and are generally used to provide for the investment of excess funds at minimal risk levels while providing liquidity to fund increases in loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits 
federal funds sold is the excess cash we have available over and above daily cash needs 
this money is invested on an overnight basis with approved correspondent banks 
correspondent banking correspondent banking involves one bank providing services to another bank which cannot provide that service for itself from an economic or practical standpoint 
we are required to purchase correspondent services offered by larger banks  including check collections  purchase of federal funds  security safekeeping  investment services  coin and currency supplies  overline and liquidity loan participations  and sales of loans to or participations with correspondent banks 
we have established a correspondent relationship with independent bankers bank of florida 
we pay for such services in cash as opposed to keeping compensating balances 
we also sell loan participations to other banks with respect to loans which exceed our lending limit 
data processing we outsource most of our data processing services  including an automated general ledger and deposit accounting  however  we service all our loans in house 
internet banking we maintain a website at www 
optimumbank 
com where customers can access account balances  view current account activity and their previous statement  view images of paid checks and transfer funds between accounts 
our website provides information regarding our visa credit card offering 
competition we encounter strong competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits 
the deregulation of the banking industry and the widespread enactment of state laws which permit multi bank holding companies as well as an increasing level of interstate banking have created a highly competitive environment for commercial banking 
in one or more aspects of our business  we compete with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking companies  and other financial intermediaries 
most of these competitors  some of which are affiliated with bank holding companies  have substantially greater resources and lending limits  and may offer certain services that we do not currently provide 
in addition  many of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern federally insured banks 
recent federal and state legislation has heightened the competitive environment in which financial institutions must conduct their business  and the potential for competition among financial institutions of all types has increased significantly 
to compete  we rely upon specialized services  responsive handling of customer needs  and personal contacts by our officers  directors  and staff 
large multi branch banking competitors tend to compete primarily by rate and the number and location of branches while smaller  independent financial institutions tend to compete primarily by rate and personal service 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including executive officers 
the employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit 
we consider relations with employees to be good

dodd frank act 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the dodd frank act  into law 
the dodd frank act will have a broad impact on the financial services industry  including potentially significant regulatory and compliance changes including  among other things  enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies  potential changes to capital and liquidity requirements  changes to regulatory examination fees  changes to assessments to be paid to the fdic for federal deposit insurance  and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of  and strengthening safety and soundness for  the financial services sector 
additionally  the dodd frank act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies  including the financial stability oversight council  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency  or the occ  and the federal deposit insurance corporation  or the fdic 
many of the requirements called for in the dodd frank act will be implemented over time and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years 
given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear 
the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of our business activities  require changes to certain of our business practices  impose upon us more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business 
these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with any such laws  regulations  or principles or changes thereto  may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
while we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us  these changes could be materially adverse to our investors and shareholders 
the following items provide a brief description of the impact of the dodd frank act on our operations and activities  both currently and prospectively 
increased capital standards and enhanced supervision 
the federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies 
these new standards will be no lower than existing regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may  in fact  be higher when established by the agencies 
compliance with heightened capital standards may reduce our ability to generate or originate revenue producing assets and thereby restrict revenue generation from banking and non banking operations 
the dodd frank act also increases regulatory oversight  supervision and examination of banks  bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency 
compliance with new regulatory requirements and expanded examination processes could increase the company s cost of operations 
the consumer financial protection bureau 
the dodd frank act creates a new  independent consumer financial protection bureau  or the bureau  within the federal reserve 
the bureau is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services 
the bureau has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers 
generally  we will not be directly subject to the rules and regulations of the bureau 
however  the dodd frank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the bureau and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the bureau against certain state chartered institutions 
any such new regulations could increase our cost of operations and  as a result  could limit our ability to expand into these products and services 
deposit insurance 
the dodd frank act makes permanent the  deposit insurance limit for insured deposits 
amendments to the federal deposit insurance act also revise the assessment base against which an insured depository institution s deposit insurance premiums paid to the fdic s deposit insurance fund  or the dif  will be calculated 
under the amendments  the assessment base will no longer be the institution s deposit base  but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity 
additionally  the dodd frank act makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif  increasing the minimum from percent to percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits  and eliminating the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
several of these provisions could increase the fdic deposit insurance premiums paid by us 
the dodd frank act also provides that  effective one year after the date of enactment  depository institutions may pay interest on demand deposits 
transactions with affiliates 
the dodd frank act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under section a and b of the federal reserve act  including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained 
transactions with insiders 
insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening on loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits 
enhanced lending limits 
the dodd frank act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution s credit exposure to one borrower 
current banking law limits a depository institution s ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons in an amount exceeding certain thresholds 
the dodd frank act expands the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  and securities lending and borrowing transactions 
company regulation general 
as a bank holding company registered under the bank holding company act of the bhca  optimumbank holdings is subject to the regulation and supervision of  and inspection by  the federal reserve board federal reserve 
optimumbank holdings also is required to file with the federal reserve annual reports and other information regarding its business operations  and those of its subsidiaries 
in the past  the bhca limited the activities of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries to activities which were limited to banking  managing or controlling banks  furnishing services to or performing services for their subsidiaries or engaging in any other activity which the federal reserve determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto 
under the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of which is discussed below  bank holding companies now have the opportunity to seek broadened authority  subject to limitations on investment  to engage in activities that are financial in nature if all of their subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized  well managed  and have at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act  which is also discussed below 
in this regard  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company  with certain limited exceptions  from i acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting stock of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company  or ii engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or performing services for its subsidiaries  unless such non banking business is determined by the frb to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto 
in making such determinations  the frb is required to weigh the expected benefit to the public  such as greater convenience  increased competition or gains in efficiency  against the possible adverse effects  such as undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  or unsound banking practices 
generally  bank holding companies  such as optimumbank holdings  are required to obtain prior approval of the federal reserve to engage in any new activity not previously approved by the federal reserve 
change of control 
the bhca also requires that every bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting shares of such bank 
in approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies  the federal reserve is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned  the convenience and needs of the communities to be served  including the parties performance under the community reinvestment act discussed below and various competitive factors 
as described in greater detail below  pursuant to the riegle neal interstate banking and branch efficiency act of the interstate banking and branching act  a bank holding company is permitted to acquire banks in states other than its home state 
the bhca further prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the federal reserve bank has been notified and has not objected to the transaction 
under a rebuttable presumption established by the federal reserve  the acquisition of or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under section of the exchange act would  under the circumstances set forth in the presumption  constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company 
in addition  any person or group of persons must obtain the approval of the federal reserve under the bhca before acquiring in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company or more of the outstanding common stock of a bank holding company  or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over the bank holding company 
interstate banking and branching 
the interstate banking and branching act provides for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
under the law  interstate acquisitions of banks or bank holding companies in any state by bank holding companies in any other state are permissible subject to certain limitations 
florida also has a law that allows out of state bank holding companies located in states that allow florida bank holding companies to acquire banks and bank holding companies in that state to acquire florida banks and florida bank holding companies 
the law essentially provides for out of state entry by acquisition only and not by interstate branching and requires the acquired florida bank to have been in existence for at least three years 
interstate branching and consolidation of existing bank subsidiaries in different states is permissible 
a florida bank also may establish  maintain  and operate one or more branches in a state other than florida pursuant to an interstate merger transaction in which the florida bank is the resulting bank 
financial modernization 
the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act sought to achieve significant modernization of the federal bank regulatory framework by allowing the consolidation of banking institutions with other types of financial services firms  subject to various restrictions and requirements 
in general  the glb act repealed most of the federal statutory barriers which separated commercial banking firms from insurance and securities firms and authorized the consolidation of such firms in a financial services holding company 
we have no current plans to utilize the structural options created by the glb act 
securities regulation and corporate governance 
the company s common stock is registered with the securities and exchange commission the sec under section g of the securities exchange act of  and we are subject to restrictions  reporting requirements and review procedures under federal securities laws and regulations 
we are also subject to the rules and reporting requirements of the nasdaq global market  on which our common stock is traded 
like other issuers of publicly traded securities  we must also comply with the corporate governance reforms enacted under the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act and the rules of the sec and nasdaq stock market adopted pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act 
among other things  these reforms  effective as of various dates  require certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  prohibit the provision of specified services by independent auditors  require pre approval of independent auditor services  define director independence and require certain committees  and a majority of a subject company s board of directors  to consist of independent directors  establish additional disclosure requirements in reports filed with the sec  require expedited filing of reports  require management evaluation and auditor attestation of internal controls  prohibit loans by the issuer but not by certain depository institutions to directors and officers  set record keeping requirements  mandate complaint procedures for the reporting of accounting and audit concerns by employees  and establish penalties for non compliance 
bank regulation general

optimumbank is examined periodically by the fdic and the florida ofr  to whom it submits periodic reports regarding its financial condition and other matters 
the fdic and the florida ofr have a broad range of powers to enforce regulations under their jurisdiction  and to take discretionary actions determined to be for the protection and safety and soundness of banks  including the institution of cease and desist orders and the removal of directors and officers 
the fdic and the florida ofr also have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers  consolidations  and similar corporate actions 
consent order 
on april   optimumbank was required to enter into a consent order with the fdic and the florida office of financial regulation 
under the consent order  the bank is required to implement a number of corrective measures intended to improve the bank s condition  including a requirement to maintain certain minimum capital ratios 
the consent order also contains significant operating restrictions 
the principal requirements of the consent order are described in business supervision and regulation consent order 
capital adequacy requirements 
banks are required to maintain capital at adequate levels based on a percentage of assets and off balance sheet exposures  adjusted for risk weights ranging from to 
under the risk based standard  capital is classified into two tiers 
tier capital consists of common shareholders equity excluding the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities  trust preferred securities subject to certain limitations  and minus certain intangible assets 
tier capital consists of the general allowance for credit losses except for certain limitations 
an institution s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk based capital ratio consists of the sum of its tier and tier capital 
the regulatory minimum requirements are for tier and for total risk based capital 
at december   our tier and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
banks are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on total assets  which is known as the leverage ratio 
the minimum requirement for the leverage ratio is  but all but the highest rated institutions are required to maintain ratios to basis points above the minimum 
at december   our leverage ratio was 
the consent order imposes higher capital requirements on optimumbank 
under the consent order  optimumbank must maintain a tier leverage ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of 
with a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at december   the bank did not meet the total risk based capital ratio as required by the consent order 
the fdic improvement act of fdicia contains prompt corrective action provisions pursuant to which banks are to be classified into one of five categories based upon capital adequacy  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized and which require subject to certain exceptions the appropriate federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action with respect to an institution which becomes significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
the fdic has issued regulations to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
in general  the regulations define the five capital categories as follows an institution is well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  has a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any written capital order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures  an institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and has a leverage ratio of or greater  an institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  has a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or has a leverage ratio that is less than  an institution is significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage ratio that is less than  and an institution is critically undercapitalized if its tangible equity is equal to or less than of its total assets 
the fdic  after an opportunity for a hearing  has authority to downgrade an institution from well capitalized to adequately capitalized or to subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower category  for supervisory concerns 
generally  fdicia requires that an undercapitalized institution must submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency within days after the institution becomes undercapitalized and the agency must take action on the plan within days 
the appropriate federal banking agency may not accept a capital restoration plan unless  among other requirements  each company having control of the institution has guaranteed that the institution will comply with the plan until the institution has been adequately capitalized on average during each of the three consecutive calendar quarters and has provided adequate assurances of performance 
the aggregate liability under this provision of all companies having control of an institution is limited to the lesser of of the institution s total assets at the time the institution becomes undercapitalized or the amount which is necessary  or would have been necessary  to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable to the institution as of the time the institution fails to comply with the plan filed pursuant to fdicia an undercapitalized institution may not acquire an interest in any company or any other insured depository institution  establish or acquire additional branch offices or engage in any new business unless the appropriate federal banking agency has accepted its capital restoration plan  the institution is implementing the plan  and the agency determines that the proposed action is consistent with and will further the achievement of the plan  or the appropriate federal banking agency determines the proposed action will further the purpose of the prompt corrective action sections of fdicia 
if an institution is critically undercapitalized  it must comply with the restrictions described above 
in addition  the appropriate federal banking agency is authorized to restrict the activities of any critically undercapitalized institution and to prohibit such an institution  without the appropriate federal banking agency s prior written approval  from entering into any material transaction other than in the usual course of business  engaging in any covered transaction with affiliates as defined in section a b of the federal reserve act  paying excessive compensation or bonuses  and paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at a rate that would increase the institution s weighted average costs of funds to a level significantly exceeding the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in the institution s normal market areas 
the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia also provide that in general no institution may make a capital distribution if it would cause the institution to become undercapitalized 
capital distributions include cash but not stock dividends  stock purchases  redemptions  and other distributions of capital to the owners of an institution 
additionally  fdicia requires  among other things  that only a well capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and the appropriate federal banking agency annually examine all insured depository institutions  with some exceptions for small  well capitalized institutions and state chartered institutions examined by state regulators 
as of december   optimumbank met the fdic definition of an adequately capitalized institution 
for additional information regarding optimumbank capital ratios and requirements  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory capital adequacy 
dividends 
optimumbank holdings ability to pay dividends is substantially dependent on the ability of optimumbank to pay dividends to optimumbank holdings 
as a state chartered bank  optimumbank is subject to dividend restrictions set by florida law and the fdic 
except with the prior approval of the florida ofr  all dividends of any florida bank must be paid out of retained net profits from the current period and the previous two years  after deducting expenses  including losses and bad debts 
under the federal deposit insurance act  an fdic insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or while it is undercapitalized 
the fdic and the florida ofr also have the general authority to limit the dividend payment by banks if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice 
the bank s ability to pay dividends is further restricted under the consent order and the company ability to pay dividends is also restricted under its written agreement with the federal reserve 
at december   the bank and company could not pay cash dividends 
loans to one borrower 
florida law generally allows a state bank such as optimumbank to extend credit to any one borrower and certain related entities of such borrower in an amount up to of its capital accounts  provided that the unsecured portion may not exceed of the capital accounts of the bank 
based upon optimumbank capital  the maximum loan optimumbank is currently permitted to make is approximately million  provided the unsecured portion does not exceed approximately million 
transactions with affiliates 
under federal law  federally insured banks are subject  with certain exceptions  to certain restrictions on any extension of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates  on investment in the stock or other securities of affiliates  and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower 
in addition  banks are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service 
change of bank control 
florida law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators 
the overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation 
consequently  shareholders of financial institutions are less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that often result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies 
under florida law  no person or group of persons may  directly or indirectly or acting by or through one or more persons  purchase or acquire a controlling interest in any bank which would result in the change in control of that bank unless the florida ofr first shall have approved such proposed acquisition 
a person or group will be deemed to have acquired control of a bank i if the person or group  directly or indirectly or acting by or through one  or more other persons  owns  controls  or has power to vote or more of any class of voting securities of the bank  or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the bank  or ii if the florida ofr determines that such person exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank 
in any case where a proposed purchase of voting securities would give rise to a presumption of control  the person or group who proposes to purchase the securities must first file written notice of the proposal to the florida ofr for its review and approval 
subsections i and  florida statutes  refer to a potential change of control of a financial institution at a or more threshold and rebuttable presumption of control 
accordingly  the name of any subscriber acquiring more than of the voting securities of optimumbank must be submitted to the florida ofr for prior approval 
usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act was enacted after september  to provide the federal government with powers to prevent  detect  and prosecute terrorism and international money laundering  and has resulted in promulgation of several regulations that have a direct impact on banks 
there are a number of programs that financial institutions must have in place such as i bank secrecy act anti money laundering programs to manage risk  ii customer identification programs to determine the true identity of customers  document and verify the information  and determine whether the customer appears on any federal government list of known or suspected terrorist or terrorist organizations  and iii monitoring for the timely detection and reporting of suspicious activity and reportable transactions 
over the past few years  enforcement  and compliance monitoring  of these anti money laundering laws has dramatically increased 
as a result  we have increased the attention and resources we dedicate to compliance with these laws 
other consumer laws 
florida usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates limit the amount of interest and various other charges collected or contracted by a bank 
optimumbank loans are also subject to federal laws applicable to consumer credit transactions  such as the federal truth in lending act governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers  community reinvestment act requiring financial institutions to meet their obligations to provide for the total credit needs of the communities they serve  including investing their assets in loans to low and moderate income borrowers  home mortgage disclosure act requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligations to meet the housing needs of the community it serves  equal credit opportunity act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race  creed or other prohibitive factors in extending credit  real estate settlement procedures act which requires lenders to disclose certain information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements  and prohibits certain lending practices  as well as limits escrow account amounts in real estate transactions  fair debt collection act governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies  fair and accurate credit transactions act which establishes additional rights for consumers to obtain and correct credit reports  addresses identity theft  and establishes additional requirements for consumer reporting agencies and financial institutions that provide adverse credit information to a consumer reporting agency  and the rules and regulations of various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws 
optimumbank deposit and loan operations are also subject to the the gramm leach bliley act of privacy provisions  which require us to maintain privacy policies intended to safeguard consumer financial information  to disclose these policies to our customers  and allow customers to opt out of having their financial service providers disclose their confidential financial information to non affiliated third parties  subject to certain exceptions  right to financial privacy act  which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records  and electronic funds transfer act and regulation e  which govern automatic deposits to  and withdrawals from  deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services 
other regulation enforcement powers 
congress has provided the federal bank regulatory agencies with an array of powers to enforce laws  rules  regulations and orders 
among other things  the agencies may require that institutions cease and desist from certain activities  may preclude persons from participating in the affairs of insured depository institutions  may suspend or remove deposit insurance  and may impose civil money penalties against institution affiliated parties for certain violations 
community redevelopment act 
bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the community reinvestment act of cra and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the appropriate bank regulatory agency 
under the terms of the cra  the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required  in connection with its examination of a bank  to assess such bank s record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the regulatory agency assessment of the bank record is made available to the public 
further  such assessment is required of any bank which has applied to charter a bank  obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution  establish a new branch office that will accept deposits  relocate an office  or merge or consolidate with  or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of  a federally regulated financial institution 
in the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the federal reserve will assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
effect of governmental monetary policies our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
the federal reserve monetary policies have had  and will likely continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of financial institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy in order  among other things  to curb inflation or combat a recession 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve have major effects upon the levels of loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirement against member bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies

the company currently plans to implement a for reverse stock split to achieve this goal 
in the event that the reverse stock split does not result in compliance  the company s common stock could be delisted from nasdaq 
at december   the bank and company could not pay cash dividends and the company does not anticipate that it will pay dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends and loans or advances made by the bank to the company 
the amount of cash dividends that may be paid by the bank to the company is based on the bank net earnings of the current year combined with the bank retained earnings of the preceding two years  as defined by state banking regulations 
however  for any dividend declaration  the company must consider additional factors such as the amount of current period net earnings  liquidity  asset quality  capital adequacy and economic conditions 
it is likely that these factors would further limit the amount of dividends which the company could declare 
furthermore  the bank s ability to pay dividends is restricted under the consent order issued by the fdic and florida office of financial regulation and banking laws

critical accounting policies our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to accounting measurements and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
when applying accounting policies in areas that are subjective in nature  we must use our best judgment to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets 
one of the most critical accounting policies applied by us is related to the valuation of our loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of our loan portfolio including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the amount and amortization of loan fees and deferred origination costs 
the calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a complex process containing estimates which are inherently subjective and susceptible to significant revision as current information becomes available 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level we believe is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the views of our regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and peer comparisons 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  changes in the economic and interest rate environment which may impact a borrower ability to pay  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to the tri county region we serve in southeast florida 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on our estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed as part of loan portfolio  asset quality and allowance for loan losses and in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
regulation and legislation as a state chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the florida office of financial regulation  or florida ofr  and the fdic 
we file reports with the florida ofr and the fdic concerning our activities and financial condition  in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions 
periodic examinations are performed by the florida ofr and the fdic to monitor our compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
the company is also subject to regulation and examination by the federal reserve board of governors 
loan portfolio  asset quality and allowance for loan losses our primary business is making real estate loans 
this activity may subject us to potential loan losses  the magnitude of which depends on a variety of economic factors affecting borrowers which are beyond our control 
for the past several years  there has been a dramatic decrease in housing and real estate values in south florida  coupled with a significant increase in the rate of unemployment 
with most of our loans concentrated in south florida  the decline in local economic conditions has adversely affected the values of our real estate collateral 
these trends have contributed to an increase in our impaired loans and reduced asset quality 
as of december   our impaired loans were approximately million  or of the net loan portfolio 
impaired loans and real estate owned were approximately million as of this same date  or of total assets 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate  they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our loan portfolio and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the market value of our loan portfolio  the losses associated with impaired loans  and the net realizable value of real estate owned 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at december  of of of amount total amount total amount total dollars in thousands residential real estate multi family real estate commercial real estate land and construction commercial consumer total loans add deduct allowance for loan losses net deferred loan costs and discounts loans  net at december  amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands residential real estate multi family real estate commercial real estate land and construction consumer total loans add deduct allowance for loan losses net deferred loan costs and discounts loans  net the following table sets forth the activity in the allowance for loan losses in thousands year ended december  beginning balance provision credit for loan losses loans charged off recoveries ending balance the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses represented and of the total loans outstanding at december  and  respectively 
we evaluate the allowance for loan losses on a regular basis 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our periodic review of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  historical loan loss experiences  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of two components 
the first component consists of amounts specifically reserved specific allowance for specific loans identified as impaired  as defined by fasb accounting standards codification no 
asc 
impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed upon 
we measure impairment on a loan by loan basis for all our loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate  the loan obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 
the second component is a general reserve general allowance on all of our loans other than those identified as impaired 
we group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss experience for that category adjusted for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and other trends or uncertainties that could affect management estimate of probable loss 
the aggregate of these two components results in our total allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth our allowance for loan losses by loan type dollars in thousands at december  of of of total total total amount loans amount loans amount loans residential real estate multi family real estate commercial real estate land and construction commercial consumer total allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding at december  of of total total amount loans amount loans residential real estate multi family real estate commercial real estate land and construction consumer total allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding the following summarizes impaired loans in thousands december  at december  recordeded investment unpaid principal balance related allowance recordeded investment unpaid principal balance related allowance with no related allowance recorded residential real estate commercial real estate land and construction consumer with an allowance recorded commercial real estate total residential real estate commercial real estate land and construction consumer total during  and  the average net investment in impaired loans and interest income recognized and received on impaired loans is as follows in thousands year ended december  average investment in impaired loans interest income recognized on impaired loans interest income received on a cash basis on impaired loans nonaccrual and past due loans were as follows as of december    and in thousands at december  nonaccrual loans past ninety days or more  but still accruing interest liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents an institution ability to meet current and future obligations through liquidation or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional liabilities 
our ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to benefit from investment opportunities is facilitated through liquidity management 
our primary sources of cash during the year ended december  were from principal repayments of securities available for sale of million and proceeds from sale of common stock of million 
cash was used primarily to repay million of deposits  repay million of federal home loan bank advances and fund million of loans 
in order to increase our core deposits  we have priced our deposit rates competitively 
we will adjust rates on our deposits to attract or retain deposits as needed 
we obtain funds primarily from depositors in our market area 
in addition to obtaining funds from depositors  we may borrow funds from other financial institutions 
we are a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta  which allows us to borrow funds under a pre arranged line of credit equal to million 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding from the federal home loan bank of atlanta to facilitate loan fundings and manage our asset and liability structure 
securities our securities portfolio is comprised primarily of mortgage backed securities 
the securities portfolio is categorized as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities held to maturity represent those securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
these securities are carried at amortized cost 
securities available for sale represent those investments which may be sold for various reasons including changes in interest rates and liquidity considerations 
these securities are reported at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our securities portfolio in thousands at december  amortized cost fair value securities available for sale mortgage backed securities us government and agency securities at december  securities available for sale mortgage backed securities us government and agency securities at december  securities held to maturity mortgage backed securities   the following table sets forth  by maturity distribution  certain information pertaining to the securities portfolio dollars in thousands within one year after one but within five years after five years through ten years after ten years total yield at december  mortgage backed securities us government and agency securities at december  mortgage backed securities us government and agency securities at december  mortgage backed securities    in june  the company transferred securities with a book value of approximately million from the held to maturity category to the available for sale category 
the fair value of the securities was million resulting in unrealized losses of approximately million 
the net unrealized loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
due to this transfer  the company will be prohibited from classifying securities as held to maturity for a period of two years 
during the year ended december   the company sold million held to maturity securities in order to downsize and deleverage its balance sheet  recognizing net gains of million 
this action was taken in an effort to comply with a significant increase in the regulatory capital requirements imposed on the bank under the consent order issued by the fdic and florida office of financial regulation 
at december   million of the million in mortgage backed securities mbs were us agency mbs and million were private label mbs 
approximately million of the private label mbs at december  were rated sub investment grade securities by the securities rating agencies 
in general  non investment grade securities cannot be used to collateralize borrowings and are considered to be substandard assets by the federal regulatory agencies 
regulatory capital adequacy failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and  possibly  additional discretionary actions by federal and state regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
in addition  the consent order imposes increased minimum capital requirements on the bank 
quantitative measures established by regulation and by the consent order to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets 
as of december   we did not meet the minimum applicable capital adequacy requirements 
see supervision and regulation bank regulation capital adequacy requirements with respect to the required tier capital to total assets ratios of 
our actual and required minimum capital ratios were as follows in thousands regulatory capital requirements actual for capital adequacy purposes minimum to be well capitalized under prompt corrective provisions requirements of consent order amount amount amount amount as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a tier i capital to total assets as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a tier i capital to total assets as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a tier i capital to total assets market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
we do not engage in securities trading or hedging activities and do not invest in interest rate derivatives or enter into interest rate swaps 
we may utilize financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital  while adjusting our asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure by managing our asset and liability structure 
however  a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings  to the extent that the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change or reprice at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we use modeling techniques to simulate changes in net interest income under various rate scenarios 
important elements of these techniques include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities  and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates of the existing balance sheet 
asset liability management as part of our asset and liability management  we have emphasized establishing and implementing internal asset liability decision processes  as well as control procedures to aid in managing our earnings 
management believes that these processes and procedures provide us with better capital planning  asset mix and volume controls  loan pricing guidelines  and deposit interest rate guidelines  which should result in tighter controls and less exposure to interest rate risk 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
the gap ratio is computed as the amount of rate sensitive assets less the amount of rate sensitive liabilities divided by total assets 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on the results of operations  our management continues to monitor our assets and liabilities to better match the maturities and repricing terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
our policies emphasize the origination of adjustable rate loans  building a stable core deposit base and  to the extent possible  matching deposit maturities with loan repricing timeframes or maturities 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   that are estimated to mature or are scheduled to reprice within the period shown dollars in thousands gap maturity repricing schedule more more than one than five one year and years and over year or less than less than fifteen less five years fifteen years years total loans residential real estate loans multi family real estate loans commercial real estate loans land and construction consumer loans consumer total loans securities federal home loan bank stock total rate sensitive assets deposit accounts money market deposits interest bearing checking deposits savings deposits time deposits total deposits federal home loan bank advances junior subordinated debenture total rate sensitive liabilities gap repricing differences cumulative gap cumulative gap total assets in preparing the table above  adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which the interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which the loans mature 
fixed rate loans are scheduled  including repayment  according to their maturities 
securities are scheduled through the repricing date 
money market  interest bearing checking and savings deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts 
all other time deposits are scheduled through the maturity dates

the average life of loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms due to prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare a conventional loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells real property subject to a mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgages are substantially higher than current mortgage rates 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
at december   we had no outstanding commitments to originate real estate loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the contractual amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the company involvement in particular classes of financial instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since certain commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total committed amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if we deem it necessary in order to extend credit  is based on management credit evaluation of the counterparty

we have focused on raising time deposits primarily within our market area  which is the tri county area of broward  miami dade and palm beach counties 
however  we offer a variety of deposit products  which we promote within our market area 
net deposits decreased million in and decreased million in we have used brokered deposits to facilitate mortgage loan fundings in circumstances when larger than anticipated loan volumes occur and there is limited time to fund the additional loan demand through traditional deposit solicitation 
in general  brokered deposits can be obtained in one to three days 
the rates paid on these deposits are typically equal to or slightly less than the high end of the interest rates in our market area 
brokered deposits amounted to million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
we have reduced our reliance on brokered deposits which are considered a more volatile source of funding by no longer accepting or rolling over existing brokered deposits

gubin entered into an amended stock purchase agreement under which the company would sell  shares to mr 
gubin at price to per share 
the amended transaction with mr 
gubin is subject to approval by the federal reserve board of governors and the ofr

if the million proceeds of the transaction with mr 
gubin had been contributed to the bank as of december   the bank s tier leverage and total risk based capital ratios on a pro forma basis would have improved to and  respectively 
the actual improvement in the bank s capital ratios after the transaction of mr 
gubin is completed will depend on the closing date of the gubin transaction  the level of the bank s assets and liabilities at that time  the amount of the bank s losses between december  and the date of the closing  and the amount of any additional capital received from other sources 
the additional million in capital from mr 
gubin is expected to provide the company and the bank with additional working capital to implement the bank s business plan  including addressing non performing loans and funding expanded lending and investment activities

gubin  the company will still need to sell additional shares of common stock to comply with the capital requirements through the end of and in subsequent years 
at the present time  the company has not received any commitments from any third parties to purchase any additional shares other than the commitment from mr 
gubin 
accordingly  it is uncertain whether the company will be able to obtain the capital that is required or the price and terms of any capital that is obtained

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates
