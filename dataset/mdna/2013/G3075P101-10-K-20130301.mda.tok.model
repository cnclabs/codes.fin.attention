for the non latent loss exposures  a range of traditional loss development extrapolation techniques is applied 
incremental paid and incurred loss development methodologies are the most commonly used methods 
traditional cumulative paid and incurred loss development methods are used where inception to date  cumulative paid and reported incurred loss development history is available 
these methods assume that groups of losses from similar exposures will increase over time in a predictable manner 
historical paid and incurred loss development experience is examined for earlier underwriting years to make inferences about how later underwriting years losses will develop 
where company specific loss information is not available or not reliable  industry loss development information published by reliable industry sources such as the reinsurance association of america is considered 
the reserving process is intended to reflect the impact of inflation and other factors affecting loss payments by taking into account changes in historical payment patterns and perceived trends 
however  there is no precise method for the subsequent evaluation of the adequacy of the consideration given to inflation  or to any other specific factor  or to the way one factor may affect another 
the loss development tables below show changes in our gross and net loss reserves in subsequent years from the prior loss estimates based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of losses for individual years 
a redundancy means the original estimate was higher than the current estimate  a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate 
the reserve redundancy line represents  as of the date indicated  the difference between the latest re estimated liability and the reserves as originally estimated

net incurred loss movements during the period comprise increases or reductions in specific case reserves advised during the period to us by our policyholders and attorneys  or by us to our reinsurers  less claims settlements made during the period by us to our policyholders  plus claim receipts made to us by our reinsurers 
prior period estimates of net ibnr reserves may change as our management considers the combined impact of commutations  policy buy backs  settlement of losses on carried reserves and the trend of incurred loss development compared to prior forecasts 
commutations provide an opportunity for us to exit exposures to entire policies with insureds and reinsureds  often at a discount to the previously estimated ultimate liability 
commutations are beneficial to us as they extinguish liabilities and reduce the potential for future adverse loss development 
all prior historical loss development that relates to commuted exposures is eliminated to produce revised historical loss development for the remaining non commuted exposures 
our independent actuaries apply their actuarial methodologies to the remaining aggregate exposures and revised historical loss development information to reassess their estimates of ultimate liabilities  and  after management s review of and  if necessary  adjustments to those estimates  we reassess our estimate of ibnr reserves 
because the majority of commutation activity takes place during the fourth quarter  the focus of our actuarial evaluation of ultimate liabilities also occurs in the fourth quarter 
policy buy backs provide an opportunity for us to settle individual policies and losses usually at a discount to carried advised loss reserves 
as part of our routine claims settlement operations  claims will settle at either below or above the carried advised loss reserve 
the impact of policy buy backs and the routine settlement of claims updates historical loss development information to which actuarial methodologies are applied often resulting in revised estimates of ultimate liabilities 
our actuarial methodologies include industry benchmarking which  under certain methodologies  compares the trend of our loss development to that of the industry 
to the extent that the trend of our loss development compared to the industry changes in any period  it is likely to have an impact on the estimate of ultimate liabilities

asbestos and environmental a e exposure general a e exposures a number of our subsidiaries wrote general liability policies and reinsurance prior to their acquisition by us under which policyholders continue to present asbestos related injury claims and claims alleging injury  damage or clean up costs arising from environmental pollution 
these policies  and the associated claims  are referred to as a e exposures 
the vast majority of these claims are presented under policies written many years ago 
there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding a e claims 
this uncertainty impacts the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate amount of unpaid claims and related lae 
the majority of these claims differ from any other type of claim because there is inadequate loss development and there is significant uncertainty regarding what  if any  coverage exists  to which  if any  policy years claims are attributable and which  if any  insurers reinsurers may be liable 
these uncertainties are exacerbated by lack of clear judicial precedent and legislative interpretations of coverage that may be inconsistent with the intent of the parties to the insurance contracts and expand theories of liability 
the insurance and reinsurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is  thus  confronted with continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify a e exposures 
our a e exposure is administered out of our offices in the united kingdom and rhode island and centrally administered from the united kingdom 
in light of the intensive claim settlement process for these claims  which involves comprehensive fact gathering and subject matter expertise  our management believes that it is prudent to have a centrally administered claim facility to handle a e claims on behalf of all of our subsidiaries 
our a e claims staff  working in conjunction with two us qualified attorneys experienced in a e liabilities  proactively administers  on a cost effective basis  the a e claims submitted to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
our independent  external actuaries use industry benchmarking methodologies to estimate appropriate ibnr reserves for our a e exposures 
these methods are discussed in detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
the liability for unpaid losses and lae  inclusive of a e reserves  reflects our best estimate for future amounts needed to pay losses and related lae as of each of the balance sheet dates reflected in the financial statements herein in accordance with us gaap 
as of december   we had net loss reserves of 
table of contents million for asbestos related claims and million for environmental pollution related claims 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our gross and net loss and alae reserves from a e exposures and the movement in gross and net reserves years ended december  gross net gross net gross net in thousands of us dollars provisions for a e claims and alae at january a e losses and alae incurred during the year a e losses and alae paid during the year provision for a e claims and alae acquired during the year provision for a e claims and alae at december during  and  excluding the impact of loss reserves acquired during the year  our reserves for a e liabilities decreased by million  million and million on a gross basis and by million  million and million on a net basis  respectively 
the reductions in gross reserves arose from paid claims  successful commutations  policy buy backs  generally favorable claim settlements during the year and reductions in ibnr resulting from actuarial analysis of remaining liabilities 
asbestos continues to be the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and expense 
we believe that the insurance industry has been adversely affected by judicial interpretations that have had the effect of maximizing insurance recoveries for asbestos claims  from both a coverage and liability perspective 
generally  only policies underwritten prior to have potential asbestos exposure  since most policies underwritten after this date contain an absolute asbestos exclusion 
from through the industry experienced increasing numbers of asbestos claims  including claims from individuals who did not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure 
since  however  new claim filings have been fairly stable 
it is possible that the increases observed in the early part of the decade were triggered by various state tort reforms discussed immediately below 
we cannot predict whether claim filings will return to pre levels  remain stable  or begin to decrease 
since  several us states have proposed  and in many cases enacted  tort reform statutes that impact asbestos litigation by  for example  making it more difficult for a diverse group of plaintiffs to jointly file a single case  reducing forum shopping by requiring that a potential plaintiff must have been exposed to asbestos in the state in which he she files a lawsuit  or permitting consolidation of discovery 
these statutes typically apply to suits filed after a stated date 
when a statute is proposed or enacted  asbestos defendants often experience a marked increase in new lawsuits  as plaintiffs attorneys seek to file suit before the effective date of the legislation 
some of this increased claim volume likely represents an acceleration of valid claims that would have been brought in the future  while some claims will likely prove to have little or no merit 
as many of these claims are still pending  we cannot predict what portion of the increased number of claims represent valid claims 
also  the acceleration of claims increases the uncertainty surrounding projections of future claims in the affected jurisdictions 
during the same timeframe as tort reform  the us federal and various us state governments sought comprehensive asbestos reform to manage the growing court docket and costs surrounding asbestos litigation  in 
table of contents addition to the increasing number of corporate bankruptcies resulting from overwhelming asbestos liabilities 
whereas the federal government has failed to establish a national asbestos trust fund to address the asbestos problem  several states  including texas and florida  have implemented a medical criteria reform approach that only permits litigation to proceed when a plaintiff can establish and demonstrate actual physical impairment 
much like tort reform  asbestos litigation reform also spurred a significant increase in the number of lawsuits filed in advance of the law s enactment 
we cannot predict whether the current drop off in the number of filed claims is due to the accelerated number of filings before the law s enactment or an actual trend in the decline of alleged asbestos injuries 
environmental pollution exposures environmental pollution claims represent another significant exposure for us 
however  environmental pollution claims have been developing as expected over the past few years as a result of stable claim trends 
claims against fortune companies are generally declining  and while insureds with single site exposures are still active  in many cases claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to improved site remediation technology and effective policy buy backs 
despite the stability of recent trends  there remains significant uncertainty involved in estimating liabilities related to these exposures 
unlike asbestos claims which are generated primarily from allegedly injured private individuals  environmental claims generally result from governmentally initiated activities 
first  the number of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown 
approximately  sites are included on the national priorities list npl of the united states environmental protection agency as of september   the end of its most recent fiscal year  an increase of sites from the prior year 
state authorities have separately identified many additional sites and  at times  aggressively implement site cleanups 
second  the liabilities of the insureds themselves are difficult to estimate 
at any given site  the allocation of remediation cost among the potentially responsible parties varies greatly depending upon a variety of factors 
third  as with asbestos liability and coverage issues  judicial precedent regarding liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims does not provide clear guidance 
there is also uncertainty as to the us federal superfund law itself and  at this time  we cannot predict what  if any  reforms to this law might be enacted by the us federal government  or the effect of any such changes on the insurance industry 
other latent exposures while we do not view health hazard exposures such as silica and tobacco as becoming a material concern  recent developments in lead litigation have caused us to watch these matters closely 
recently  municipal and state governments have had success  using a public nuisance theory  pursuing the former makers of lead pigment for the abatement of lead paint in certain home dwellings 
as lead paint was used almost exclusively into the early s  large numbers of old housing stock contain lead paint that can prove hazardous to people and  particularly  children 
although governmental success has been limited thus far  we continue to monitor developments carefully due to the size of the potential awards sought by plaintiffs 
investments investment strategy we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
as a result  our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio 
because of the unpredictable nature of losses that may arise under our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries insurance or reinsurance policies and as a result of our opportunistic commutation strategy  our liquidity needs can be substantial and may arise at any time 
except for that portion of our portfolio that is invested in non investment grade securities  we generally follow a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets and provide sufficient liquidity for the prompt payment of claims and settlement of commutation payments 

table of contents as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  inclusive of restricted amounts  of million 
our cash and cash equivalent portfolio is comprised mainly cash  high grade fixed deposits  commercial paper with maturities of less than three months and money market funds 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of investment grade  liquid  fixed maturity securities of short to medium duration and mutual funds 
we strive to structure our investments in a manner that recognizes our liquidity needs for future liabilities 
in that regard  we attempt to correlate the maturity and duration of our investment portfolio to our general liability profile 
if our liquidity needs or general liability profile unexpectedly change  we may adjust the structure of our investment portfolio to meet new business needs 
we utilize various companies to provide investment advisory and or management services 
we have agreed to pay investment management fees to the managers 
these fees  which vary depending on the amount of assets under management  are included in net investment income 
the total fees we paid to our investment managers for the year ended december  were million  including approximately million to our largest single investment manager 
our investment performance is subject to a variety of risks  including risks related to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  foreign exchange risk  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in significant losses  realized or unrealized  in the value of our investment portfolio 
a portion of our non investment grade securities consists of alternative investments that subject us to restrictions on redemption  which may limit our ability to withdraw funds for some period of time after the initial investment 
the values of  and returns on  such investments may also be more volatile

regulation general the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
we have a significant presence in bermuda  the united kingdom  australia and the united states and are subject to extensive regulation under the applicable statutes in these countries 
a summary of the material regulations governing us in these countries is set forth below 
bermuda as a holding company  we are not subject to bermuda insurance regulations 
however  the insurance act of bermuda and related regulations  as amended  or  together  the insurance act  regulate the insurance business of our operating subsidiaries in bermuda and provide that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the bermuda monetary authority  or bma  under the insurance act 
insurance as well as reinsurance is regulated under the insurance act 
the insurance act also imposes on bermuda insurance companies certain solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants the bma powers to supervise  investigate  require information and the production of documents and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
our regulated bermuda subsidiaries  which are incorporated to carry on general insurance and reinsurance business  are registered as class or a insurers in bermuda and are regulated as such under the insurance act 
these regulated bermuda subsidiaries are not licensed to carry on long term business  which broadly includes life insurance and disability insurance with terms in excess of five years 
significant requirements pertaining to class or a insurers include the appointment of a principal representative in bermuda  the appointment of an independent auditor  the appointment of an approved loss reserve specialist  the filing of annual statutory financial statements and the filing of statutory financial returns 

table of contents our regulated bermuda subsidiaries must also comply with a minimum liquidity ratio and minimum solvency margin 
these are determined as a percentage of either net reserves for losses and loss expenses or premiums and  for some of our subsidiaries  pursuant to a risk based capital measure introduced by the bma in the risk based capital measure establishes an enhanced capital requirement that takes account of eight categories of risk fixed maturity investment risk  equity risk  interest rate liquidity risk  premium risk  reserve risk  credit risk  catastrophe risk and operational risk 
each of our regulated bermuda insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if it were in breach of its minimum solvency margin or liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause it to fail to meet such margin or ratio 
in addition  each of our regulated bermuda insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries is prohibited  without the prior approval of the bermuda regulator  from reducing by or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous year s statutory financial statements 
any person who  directly or indirectly  becomes a holder of at least   or of our ordinary shares must notify the bma in writing within days of becoming such a holder 
the bma may  by written notice  object to such a person if it appears to the bma that the person is not fit and proper to be such a holder 
the bma may require the holder to reduce their holding of ordinary shares and direct  among other things  that voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares shall not be exercisable 
the bma may also object to a person holding or more of the ordinary shares if it appears to the bma that the person is not  or is no longer  fit and proper to be such a holder  and may require the shareholder to reduce its holding of ordinary shares and direct  among other things  that such shareholder s voting rights attaching to ordinary shares shall not be exercisable 
a person that does not comply with such notices or directions from the bma will be guilty of an offense 
united kingdom and lloyd s united kingdom our uk based insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the uk financial services authority  or the fsa 
the fsa carries out the prudential supervision of insurance companies through a variety of methods  including the collection of information from statistical returns  review of accountants reports  close supervision of management  visits to insurance companies and regular formal interviews 
although in run off  our regulated uk subsidiaries remain regulated by the fsa  but may not underwrite new business 
eu directives also allow certain of our regulated uk subsidiaries to conduct business in eu states other than the eu within the scope of permission granted by the fsa without the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in eu countries 
our uk based insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain adequate financial resources  the rules for which are set out in the general prudential sourcebook  or genpru  and the prudential sourcebook for insurers  or inspru  of the fsa s handbook of rules and guidance 
through its rules  the fsa sets minimum capital resources requirements for its regulated insurance companies 
the calculation of the minimum capital resources requirements in any particular case depends on  among other things  the type and amount of insurance business written and claims paid by the insurance company 
in addition  the fsa s individual capital adequacy standards framework  or icas framework  requires insurance companies to carry out various capital modeling and risk management exercises in order to calculate a company specific individual capital assessment amount  or ica amount  which is the company s internal calculation of its capital requirements under the icas framework 
the basis for this calculation is prescribed in genpru and is intended to ensure a company holds sufficient capital such that there is no material risk that its liabilities cannot be met as they fall due 
in  the european parliament approved the solvency ii framework directive 
solvency ii was due to take effect january   but is now expected to be delayed until january solvency ii will set out new  strengthened eu wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the aim of increasing policyholder protection  instilling greater risk awareness and improving the international competitiveness of eu insurers 

table of contents the fsa s rules require our uk insurance subsidiaries to obtain fsa approval for any proposed or actual payment of a dividend 
the fsa uses the ica and the estimated capital requirement for solvency ii purposes when assessing requests to make distributions and therefore dividends approved by the fsa will often significantly differ from any surplus capital above the entity s minimum capital resources requirements 
under the financial services and markets act of  any company or individual together with its or his concert parties proposing to directly or indirectly acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company which is generally defined as acquiring or more of the shares or voting power in a uk authorized insurance company or its parent company must seek prior approval of the fsa of his intention to do so 
the fsa would then have up to working days to consider whether the acquirer is a fit and proper person to have such control and whether the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against us by the fsa 
a person who is already deemed to have control will require prior approval of the fsa if the person increases the level of control beyond  and 
it is expected that beginning april   the fsa s insurance regulatory functions will be divided and carried out by two new organizations  the prudential regulatory authority and the financial conduct authority 
lloyd s we participate in the lloyd s market through our interest in shelbourne  which consists of an approved lloyd s managing agent  a corporate member and s  a wholly aligned syndicate 
s has permission to underwrite ritc and other legacy or discontinued business type transactions with other lloyd s syndicates 
our lloyd s operations are subject to regulation by the fsa and compliance with the lloyd s act s and byelaws 
in order to achieve finality and to release their capital known as funds at lloyd s  lloyd s members are usually required to have transferred their liabilities through an approved ritc  such as offered by s the lloyd s market is currently in the solvency ii internal model application process under lloyd s supervision 
shelbourne will therefore be required to meet solvency ii standards when they come into effect 
united states we own ten property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the us  our us insurers  all of which are in run off 
our us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision by the states in which they are domiciled  licensed and or approved to conduct business 
the insurance laws and regulations of the state of domicile have the most significant impact on operations 
general 
generally  regulatory authorities have broad regulatory powers over such matters as licenses  standards of solvency  premium rates  policy forms  marketing practices  claims practices  investments  security deposits  methods of accounting  form and content of financial statements  reserves and provisions for unearned premiums  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  reinsurance  minimum capital and surplus requirements  dividends and other distributions to shareholders  periodic examinations and annual and other report filings 
in addition  transactions among affiliates  including certain reinsurance agreements or arrangements  as well as certain third party transactions  require prior approval or non disapproval from  or prior notice to  the applicable regulator under certain circumstances 
regulatory authorities also conduct periodic financial  claims and other types of examinations 
oversight of financial condition 
the insurance regulatory information system  or iris  of the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is intended primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies certain industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values of the ratios can lead to 
table of contents inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners regarding different aspects of an insurer s business 
insurers that report unusual values may be targeted for regulatory review 
for  certain of our us insurers generated iris ratios that were outside of the usual ranges 
only one of our us insurers which was acquired whilst under regulatory supervision has been subject to any increased regulatory review  but there is no assurance that our other us insurers will not be subject to increased scrutiny in the future 
risk based capital requirements 
the us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are also required to maintain minimum levels of solvency and liquidity as determined by law  and to comply with risk based capital requirements and licensing rules 
in order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency  the naic adopted a formula and model law to implement risk based capital requirements for property and casualty insurance companies 
these risk based capital requirements change from time to time and are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations 
insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the risk based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
under the approved formula  an insurer s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital requirement 
if this ratio is above a minimum threshold  no company or regulatory action is necessary 
some of our us insurers  from time to time  may have risk based capital levels that are below required levels and be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and control by their domestic and possibly other insurance regulators 
as of december  and  all of our us insurers exceeded their required levels of risk based capital  with the exception of one subsidiary that was acquired whilst under supervision 
as a consequence of being under regulatory supervision  the subsidiary s regulator must approve any and all disbursements  new contracts or agreements 
we do not believe this subsidiary s non compliance presents material risk to our operations or financial condition 
restrictions on dividends and other payments from insurance subsidiaries 
applicable insurance laws also restrict the amount of dividends our us regulated subsidiaries can pay to us 
the restrictions are generally based on statutory net income and or certain levels of statutory surplus as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting requirements of the states or states in which our us insurers are domiciled 
generally  prior regulatory approval must be obtained before an insurer may pay a dividend or make a distribution above a specified level 
statutory accounting principles 
the us insurers are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on a statutory basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
statutory accounting principles differ from us gaap in the treatment of various items  including treatment of deferred acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves  reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes 
for our us insurers  there are no prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices that differ significantly from the statutory accounting principles established by the naic 
statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted  in part  by state insurance departments  will determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of our us insurers  which will affect  in part  the amount of funds they have available to pay dividends to us 
ownership and control 
before a person can acquire control of a domestic insurer including a reinsurer or any person controlling such insurer or reinsurer  including acquiring control of enstar  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state in which the domestic insurer is domiciled and  under certain circumstances  from insurance commissioners in other jurisdictions 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer or person controlling the domestic insurer  the state insurance commissioner of the jurisdiction in which the insurer is domiciled will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant  the integrity and management of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the acquisition of control 
generally  state statutes and regulations provide that control over a domestic insurer or person controlling a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  
table of contents directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities or securities convertible into voting securities of the domestic insurer or of a person who controls the domestic insurer 
florida statutes presently create a presumption of control when any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities or securities convertible into voting securities of the domestic insurer or person controlling a domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring or more of our ordinary shares would be presumed to acquire control of our florida domiciled insurers  and because a person acquiring or more of our ordinary shares would be presumed to acquire control of the other us insurers  the us insurance change of control laws will likely apply to such transactions 
enterprise risk 
the naic has adopted amendments to the insurance holding company system regulatory act and regulation  which would need to be adopted by the individual states for the new requirements to take effect 
to date  two of the states in which our us insurers are domiciled california and rhode island have adopted the amendments  but others may adopt the amendments in the future 
the amendments impose more extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers or reinsurers with the purpose of protecting them from enterprise risk  including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system 
the amendments also require  under certain circumstances  any controlling person of a us insurance company seeking to divest its controlling interest in the insurance company to file with the commissioner a confidential notice of the proposed divestiture at least days prior to the cessation of control  after receipt of the notice  the commissioner determines whether a filing for approval of the transaction is necessary 
the naic has also adopted the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act  which also would need to be adopted by individual states to take effect 
the model act requires every us insurer or its holding company group to complete an own risk and solvency assessment on a yearly basis  including a self assessment of risk management and capital adequacy 
federal regulation dodd frank act 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the dodd frank act  has significant implications for the insurance industry 
among other things  the dodd frank act established the financial services oversight council  or the fsoc  which is authorized to require supervision of certain significant non bank financial companies  including insurance companies  by the board of governors of the federal reserve  or the board of governors 
the dodd frank act also created within the united states department of the treasury a new federal insurance office  or the fio 
the fsoc and the fio are authorized to study  monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market 
the dodd frank act authorizes the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws and streamlines the regulation of reinsurance and surplus lines non admitted insurance 
many provisions of the dodd frank act will become effective over time  and certain provisions of the dodd frank act require the implementation of regulations that have not yet been adopted 
at this time  we cannot assess the potential impact of the dodd frank act on the us insurance industry  or on us  including our subsidiaries  or our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
however  our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or if we or any of the insurers  reinsurers or other companies with which we do business become subject to supervision by the board of governors 
australia our australian regulated insurance entities which include our insurance subsidiary and our non operating holding company are subject to prudential supervision by the australian prudential regulation authority  or apra 
apra is the primary regulatory body responsible for regulating compliance with the insurance act apra has issued prudential standards that apply to general insurers in relation to capital adequacy  the holding of assets in australia  risk management  business continuity management  reinsurance management  outsourcing  audit and actuarial reporting and valuation  the transfer and amalgamation of insurance businesses  governance  and the fit and proper assessment of the insurer s responsible persons 

table of contents apra s prudential standards require that all insurers maintain and meet prescribed capital adequacy requirements to enable their insurance obligations to be met under a wide range of circumstances 
this requires authorized insurers to hold eligible capital in excess of the minimum capital requirement  which may be determined using the standard method or an internal model based method 
our australian insurance subsidiary has adopted the standard method 
as of january   apra introduced capital reforms that have modified how australian insurers meet their capital requirements and have introduced additional regulatory obligations with respect to capital oversight 
the new capital requirements were brought in to enhance and strengthen capital adequacy in the market and increase the level of internal oversight and review for insurers 
our australian insurance subsidiary meets the new capital requirements 
an insurer must obtain apra s written consent prior to making any planned reductions in its capital  including any payment of dividends 
our insurance subsidiary must provide apra a valuation prepared by an appointed actuary that demonstrates that the tangible assets of the insurer  after the proposed capital reduction  are sufficient to cover its insurance liabilities to a level of sufficiency of capital before apra will consent to a capital release or dividend 
under the financial sector shareholdings act  the interest of an individual shareholder or a group of associated shareholders in an insurer is generally limited to a stake of the insurer 
a person s stake is the aggregate of the person s voting power and the voting power of the person s associates 
a higher percentage limit may be approved by the treasurer of the commonwealth of australia on national interest grounds 
europe in addition to bermuda  the united kingdom  australia and the united states  we have subsidiaries in various other countries  including switzerland  denmark  ireland and sweden  and in the future could acquire new subsidiaries in other countries 
our swiss insurance subsidiary is regulated by the swiss financial market supervisory authority  or finma  pursuant to the insurance supervisory act this subsidiary is obligated to maintain a minimum solvency margin based on the solvency i and swiss solvency test regulations as stipulated by the insurance supervisory act 
the amount of dividends that this subsidiary is permitted to distribute is restricted to freely distributable reserves  which consist of retained earnings  the current year profit and free reserves 
any dividend exceeding the current year profit requires finma s approval 
the solvency and capital requirements must continue to be met following any distribution 
our subsidiaries in other european jurisdictions are also regulated 
typically  such regulation is for the protection of policyholders and ceding insurance companies rather than shareholders

competition we compete in international markets with domestic and international reinsurance companies to acquire and manage insurance and reinsurance companies in run off and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run off 
the acquisition and management of companies and portfolios in run off is highly competitive 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do  have been operating for longer than we have and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the insurance and reinsurance 
table of contents industries  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
as a result  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future for suitable acquisition candidates or run off portfolio management engagements 
employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were executive officers 
all non bermudian employees who operate out of our bermuda office are subject to approval of any required work permits 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and our management believes that our relationship with our employees is excellent 
financial information about geographic areas we acquire and manage insurance and reinsurance companies in run off and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance in run off  and provide management  consulting and other services through our subsidiaries located in bermuda  the united states  the united kingdom  australia and europe to large multinational company clients with insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios in run off  relating to risks spanning the globe 
as a result  extracting and quantifying revenues attributable to certain geographic locations would be impracticable given the global nature of the business

risk factors any of the following risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results 
these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or of which we are not currently aware  and any of these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results 
you should carefully consider these risks along with the other information included in this document  including the matters addressed under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  as well as risks included elsewhere in our documents filed with the sec  before investing in any of our securities 
we may amend  supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the sec 
risks relating to our business if we are unable to implement our business strategies  our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our future results of operations will depend in significant part on the extent to which we can implement our business strategies successfully  including our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities  expanded market visibility and increased access to capital 
our business strategies include generating opportunities to acquire or manage companies and portfolios in run off  and to price effectively and review carefully these acquisitions or management arrangements  efficiently managing claims against companies or portfolios we own or manage  successfully commuting assumed liabilities and ceded reinsurance assets  and prudently managing our investments in a manner that recognizes our liquidity needs 
we may not be able to implement our strategies fully or realize the anticipated results of our strategies as a result of significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
if we fail to price acquisitions appropriately  we may fail to achieve the anticipated financial benefits of an acquisition  and operating results may suffer 
the run off industry is becoming more attractive to investors  which may lead to an increase in competition for run off acquisitions and management and consultancy engagements 
competitive conditions may negatively impact our ability to continue to acquire companies and portfolios in run off  meaning we may be unable to continue to achieve future growth 
furthermore  if we do not manage claims efficiently  or if we experience negative effects of emerging claims and coverage issues  we may experience increased provisions for loss reserves and reduced profitability in our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
if we are unable to successfully commute assumed liabilities and ceded reinsurance assets  the operating results of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may be adversely impacted 
in addition  if we are unable to manage our investments in a manner that meets our liquidity needs  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
overall  if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategies  we may not be able to achieve future growth in our earnings and our financial condition may suffer and  as a result  holders of our ordinary shares may receive lower returns 
we may require additional capital and credit in the future that may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including acquisition activity  our ability to manage the run off of our assumed policies and our ability to establish reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings in the future 
our ability to secure this financing may be affected by a number of factors  including volatility in the worldwide financial markets and the strength of our capital position and operating results 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our existing shareholders could result  and any securities that are part of such equity financing may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our already outstanding securities 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital or credit  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by  among other things  our inability to finance future acquisitions 

table of contents if our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries loss reserves are inadequate to cover their actual losses  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries net earnings and capital and surplus would be reduced  which could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves to cover their estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported incurred claims 
these reserves are only estimates of what our subsidiaries consider the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to the subsidiaries  as well as actuarial methodologies and procedures 
our commutation activity and claims settlement and development in recent years has resulted in net reductions in provisions for loss and loss adjustment expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although past experience indicates that our loss reserves have been more than adequate to meet our liabilities  because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses  we cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses in the future 
if our subsidiaries reserves are insufficient to cover their actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  our subsidiaries would have to augment their reserves and incur a charge to their earnings 
these charges could be material and would reduce our net earnings and capital and surplus 
the difficulty in estimating the subsidiaries reserves is increased because our subsidiaries loss reserves include reserves for potential asbestos and environmental  or a e  liabilities 
at december   our insurance and reinsurance companies had recorded gross a e loss reserves of million  or of the total gross loss reserves 
net a e loss reserves at december  amounted to million  or of total net loss reserves 
a e liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons  including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  the difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination  long reporting delays and the difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage 
developed case law and adequate claim history do not always exist for such claims  especially because significant uncertainty exists about the outcome of coverage litigation and whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience 
in view of the changes in the legal and tort environment that affect the development of such claims  the uncertainties inherent in valuing a e claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques and there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of our subsidiaries potential losses for these claims 
our subsidiaries have not made any changes in reserve estimates that might arise as a result of any proposed us federal legislation related to asbestos 
to further understand this risk  see business reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense on page reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  which could result in significant losses or liquidity issues for us 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to credit risk with respect to their reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve our subsidiaries of their liability to the insured 
many reinsurance companies have been negatively impacted by the difficult financial and economic conditions in recent years  including unprecedented financial market disruption 
a number of these companies  including some of those with which we conduct business  have been downgraded and or have been placed on negative outlook by various rating agencies 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay our subsidiaries even though they are able to do so  or disputes may arise regarding payment obligations 
the failure of one or more of our subsidiaries reinsurers to honor their obligations in a timely fashion may affect our cash flows  reduce our net earnings or cause us to incur a significant loss 
disputes with our reinsurers may also result in unforeseen expenses relating to litigation or arbitration proceedings 
as of december   the balances recoverable from reinsurers amounted to billion  of which million was associated with one reinsurer  which represented or more of total reinsurance balances 
table of contents recoverable 
the reinsurer had a credit rating  as provided by a major rating agency  of a 
of the million recoverable from the reinsurer  million is secured by a trust fund held for our benefit 
our exposure to this reinsurer and any other reinsurers who represent meaningful percentages of our total reinsurance balances recoverable may increase the risks described above 
uncertain conditions in the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the event of financial turmoil affecting the global banking system and financial markets including the sovereign debt markets  additional consolidation of the financial services industry  or significant financial service institution failures  there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets  low liquidity  and extreme volatility in fixed maturity  credit  currency  and equity markets 
this could have a number of effects on our business  including our ability to obtain financing for future acquisitions 
even if financing is available  it may only be available at an unattractive cost of capital  which would decrease our profitability 
net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains or losses also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments  impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments  interest rates  cash balances  and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments 
increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 
in addition  rating agency downgrades of the us and us government s credit rating and the credit ratings of certain european countries reflect a growing concern of the potential default of government issuers and have created broader financial turmoil and uncertainty  which has weighed heavily on the global banking system 
these downgrades and any future downgrades of the us and us government s credit rating and the credit ratings of one or more european countries may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the return on and value of our investments 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may cause us to experience losses 
we maintain a portion of our investments  insurance liabilities and insurance assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
consequently  we and our subsidiaries may experience foreign exchange losses  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we publish our consolidated financial statements in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in exchange rates used to convert other currencies  particularly australian dollars  euros and british pounds  into us dollars will impact our reported consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows from year to year 
fluctuations in the reinsurance industry may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
the reinsurance industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general may also cause our operating results to fluctuate 
as a result  the industry s and our profitability may be affected significantly by fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may affect the ultimate payout of loss amounts and the costs of administering books of reinsurance business  volatile and unpredictable developments  such as those that have occurred in recent years in the world wide financial and credit markets  which may adversely affect the recoverability of reinsurance from our reinsurers  changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 

table of contents emerging claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our business 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the adequacy of our provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses by either extending coverage beyond the intent of insurance policies and reinsurance contracts envisioned at the time they were written  or by increasing the number or size of claims 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by an increase in insurance and reinsurance contract disputes  arbitration and litigation 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have acquired companies or portfolios of insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under these insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract has been issued 
exit and finality opportunities provided by solvent schemes of arrangement may not continue to be available  which may result in the diversion of our resources to settle policyholder claims for a substantially longer run off period and increase the associated costs of run off of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
with respect to our uk  bermudian and australian insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  we are able to pursue strategies to achieve complete finality and conclude the run off of a company by promoting solvent schemes of arrangement 
solvent schemes of arrangement have been a popular means of achieving financial certainty and finality for insurance and reinsurance companies incorporated or managed in the uk  bermuda and australia  by making a one time full and final settlement of an insurance and reinsurance company s liabilities to policyholders 
a solvent scheme of arrangement is an arrangement between a company and its creditors or any class of them 
for a solvent scheme of arrangement to become binding on the creditors  a meeting of each class of creditors must be called  with the permission of the local court  to consider and  if thought fit  approve the solvent scheme of arrangement 
the requisite statutory majority of creditors of not less than in value and in number of those creditors actually attending the meeting  either in person or by proxy  must vote in favor of a solvent scheme of arrangement 
once the solvent scheme of arrangement has been approved by the statutory majority of voting creditors of the company  it requires the sanction of the local court at a hearing at which creditors may appear 
the court must be satisfied that the scheme is fair  following a full consideration of the relevant evidence and of the scheme s individual merits 
should a solvent scheme of arrangement promoted by any of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries fail to receive the requisite approval by creditors or sanction by the court  we will have to run off these liabilities until expiry  which may result in the diversion of our resources to settle policyholder claims for a substantially longer run off period and increase the associated costs of run off  resulting potentially in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on our executive officers  directors and other key personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business 
our success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of our senior management and other key employees to implement our business strategy 
we believe that there are only a limited number of available qualified personnel in the business in which we compete 
we rely substantially upon the services of dominic f 
silvester  our chief executive officer  paul j 
o shea and nicholas a 
packer  our executive vice presidents and joint chief operating officers  richard j 
harris  our chief financial officer  and our subsidiaries executive officers and directors to identify and consummate the acquisition of insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios in run off on favorable terms and to implement our run off strategy 
the loss of the services of any of our management or other key personnel  or the loss of the services of or our relationships with any of our directors  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians  holders of a permanent resident s certificate or holders of a working resident s certificate may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian  holder of a permanent resident s certificate or holders of a working resident s certificate is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
as a result  if we were to lose any of our key employees  the work permit laws and policies may hinder our ability to replace them 
we are a holding company  and we are dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us 
we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
our only significant assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  we are dependent on distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to pay dividends  fund acquisitions or fulfill financial obligations in the normal course of our business 
our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make dividend payments  acquire additional companies or insurance or reinsurance portfolios or fulfill other financial obligations 
the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to make distributions to us is limited by applicable insurance laws and regulations which are described in business regulation beginning on page  and the ability of all of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by  among other things  other applicable laws and regulations and the terms of our bank loans and our subsidiaries bank loans 
conflicts of interest might prevent us from pursuing desirable investment and business opportunities 
our directors and executive officers may have ownership interests or other involvement with entities that could compete against us  either in the pursuit of acquisition targets or in general business operations 
on occasion  we have also participated in transactions in which one or more of our directors or executive officers had an interest  and we may do so in the future 
the interests of our directors and executive officers in such transactions or such entities may result in a conflict of interest for those directors and officers 
the audit committee of our board of directors  which is comprised entirely of independent directors  reviews any material transactions involving a conflict of interest and may take actions as it deems appropriate in the particular circumstances 
we may not be able to pursue all advantageous transactions that we would otherwise pursue in the absence of a conflict should our audit committee be unable to determine that any such transaction is on terms as favorable as we could otherwise obtain in the absence of a conflict 
if third party administrators were to breach obligations owed to us  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
certain of our subsidiaries rely on relationships with a number of third party administrators  under contracts pursuant to which these third party administrators manage and pay claims on our subsidiaries behalf and advise with respect to case reserves 
in these relationships  we rely on controls incorporated in the provisions of the administration agreement  as well as on the administrator s internal controls  to manage the claims process within our prescribed parameters 
although we monitor these administrators on an ongoing basis  our monitoring efforts may not be adequate or our administrators could exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us  which  if material  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our failure to comply with covenants contained in our credit facilities could trigger prepayment obligations  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we and our subsidiaries currently have three outstanding credit facilities  including our revolving credit facility  the clarendon facility and the seabright facility 
these credit facilities contain various business and financial covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to  among other things  limitations on mergers and consolidations  acquisitions  indebtedness and guarantees  restrictions as to certain dispositions of stock and dividends  investment constraints and limitations on liens on stock 
we may also 
table of contents enter into future credit facilities or other debt arrangements containing similar or different restrictive covenants 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the credit facilities  which could result in us being required to repay the amounts outstanding under these facilities prior to maturity 
these prepayment obligations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  complying with these covenants could limit our financial and operational flexibility 
our credit facilities are described in more detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations long term debt on page if we experience difficulties with our information technology assets or cyber security  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely heavily on the successful  uninterrupted functioning of our information technology assets  as well as those of any third party service providers we use 
our business is dependent upon our ability to perform  in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  necessary business functions  such as paying claims and performing actuarial and other modeling functions  acquisition work and other necessary legal  financial and business functions 
a failure of our information technology assets could materially impact our ability to perform these functions  affect the confidentiality  availability or integrity of information or information systems  expose us to litigation and increase our administrative expenses 
computer viruses  hackers and other external hazards  as well any internal process failures  could expose our information technology assets to security breaches that may cause critical data to be corrupted or confidential or proprietary information to be exposed 
the potential consequences of a cyber security incident could include liability and reputational damage to our company and could cause us to commit resources  management time and money to remediate these breaches  any of which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business 
risks relating to our acquisitions our inability to successfully price acquisitions and manage our portfolio of insurance and reinsurance companies in run off may adversely impact our ability to grow our business and may result in material losses 
our business is acquiring and managing insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance in run off 
our run off business differs from the business of traditional insurance and reinsurance underwriting in that our companies and portfolios in run off no longer underwrite new policies and are subject to the risk that their stated provisions for losses and loss adjustment expense  or lae  will not be sufficient to cover future losses and the cost of run off 
because our companies and portfolios in run off no longer collect underwriting premiums  our sources of capital to cover losses are limited to our stated reserves  reinsurance coverage and retained earnings 
as of december   our gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense totaled billion  and our reinsurance balances recoverable totaled billion 
in order for us to achieve positive operating results  we must first price acquisitions on favorable terms relative to the risks posed by the acquired businesses and then successfully manage the acquired businesses by efficiently managing claims  collecting from reinsurers and controlling run off expenses 
failure to do these things successfully could result in us having to cover losses sustained under assumed policies with retained earnings  which would materially and adversely impact our ability to grow our business and may result in material losses 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  acquisitions of insurance and reinsurance companies in run off  and these activities may not be financially beneficial to us or our shareholders 
we have pursued and  as part of our strategy  we will continue to pursue growth through acquisitions 
since our formation in august  we have acquired insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of 
table of contents insurance and reinsurance business  and we expect to continue to make such acquisitions in the future 
we cannot be certain that any of these acquisitions will be financially advantageous for us or our shareholders 
the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions  as well as the integration of an acquired business or portfolio  could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation  levels of claims or other liabilities and exposures  an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs and financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification  reinsurance and other obligations to us if any such obligations are in place 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisition strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our past and future acquisitions involve risks  and we may not realize the expected benefits because of underperformance relative to our expectations  unforeseen liabilities and expenses  integration difficulties and other challenges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the acquisitions we have made and expect to make in the future may pose operational challenges  expose us to risks and divert management s time and energy  including relating to funding cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenues are not realized or are delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties  funding cash flow shortages that may occur if expenses are greater than anticipated  the value of assets being lower than expected or diminishing because of credit defaults or changes in interest rates  or liabilities assumed or acquired being greater than expected  integrating financial and operational reporting systems  including assurance of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and our reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act  establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls  leveraging our existing capabilities and expertise into the business acquired  funding increased capital needs and overhead expenses  integrating technology platforms  obtaining and retaining management personnel required for expanded operations  and fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates relating to the assets and liabilities we may acquire 
our failure to manage successfully these operational challenges and risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may not complete future acquisitions within the time frame we anticipate or at all  which could have a negative effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a key part of our business strategy is completing acquisitions of insurance and reinsurance businesses in run off and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance businesses in run off 
once we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire a business or portfolio  conditions to closing  such as obtaining regulatory approvals or shareholder approvals  must be met before the acquisition can be consummated 
these and other closing 
table of contents conditions may not be satisfied at all  or may cause a material delay in the anticipated timing of closing 
in addition  our ability to complete the acquisition on the originally anticipated terms  or at all  could be jeopardized if a seller receives competing proposals  if litigation is brought challenging the transaction or certain of its terms  or if regulators impose unexpected terms and conditions on the transaction 
failure to consummate an acquisition on the originally anticipated terms  or a significant delay in the closing  could result in significant expense  diversion of time and resources  reputational damage  litigation and a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  all of which could materially adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our pending acquisition of the hsbc insurance companies will represent a substantial expansion of our life insurance run off portfolio  and presents certain different risks and uncertainties than those of our existing business  which could cause a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on september   we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which one of our subsidiaries will acquire the hsbc insurance companies 
the transaction is conditioned on  among other things  governmental and regulatory approvals and satisfaction of various customary closing conditions 
we expect to complete the acquisition by the end of the first quarter of the companies to be acquired have written various us and canadian life insurance  including credit insurance  term life insurance  assumed reinsurance  corporate owned life insurance and annuities 
the acquired businesses will represent a substantial increase to our life insurance portfolio 
the future performance of the acquired businesses will be highly dependent on our ability to manage the run off successfully and our ability to integrate and operate the business effectively and efficiently following closing 
many of the risks and uncertainties associated with our existing business  which consists primarily of non life property and casualty run off  remain largely the same when applied to the life insurance business 
however  the acquired business will also present certain risks that are different from our existing business 
for example  the cost of claims and benefits of our subsidiaries various life insurance products will be influenced by many factors  including mortality and morbidity rates  lapse rates and the performance of assets to support the liabilities 
our life subsidiaries will also be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality  such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths 
in addition  in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment and lower consumer spending  our life insurance subsidiaries may experience an elevated incidence of lapses of life insurance policies because there is a greater risk that policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 
with respect to certain of our subsidiaries life insurance products  our subsidiaries will be dependent upon the counterparty to an administrative services agreement in order to collect policy premiums and maintain necessary customer data 
there is a risk that the counterparty may fail to perform its obligations under the agreement to provide accurate and timely premiums and data  or that we or the counterparty could experience difficulties with the operation of the supporting technology systems 
any of these risks could result in underperformance of the acquired business compared to our expectations  and could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to our investments the value of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries investment portfolios and the investment income that our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries receive from these portfolios may decline materially as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets  which consist primarily of investments in fixed maturity securities 
the net investment income that our subsidiaries realize from investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with changes in interest rates 
the fair 
table of contents market value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  which are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
the fair market value can also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities to deteriorate 
any such deterioration of credit ratings on our fixed maturity security investments may result in the need to liquidate these securities in the financial markets 
if we are required to liquidate these securities during a period of tightening credit  we may realize a significant loss 
in addition  some of our fixed maturity securities  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  carry prepayment risk  or the risk that principal will be returned more rapidly or slowly than expected  as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
when interest rates decline  consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages  causing us to be repaid more quickly than we might have originally anticipated  meaning that our opportunities to reinvest these proceeds back into the investment markets may be at reduced interest rates with the converse being true in a rising interest rate environment 
mortgage backed and other asset backed securities are also subject to default risk on the underlying securitized mortgages  which would decrease the value of our investments 
the fair market value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities classified as trading and or available for sale in our subsidiaries investment portfolios amounted to billion at december  the changes in the market value of our subsidiaries securities that are classified as trading or available for sale are reflected in our financial statements 
other than temporary impairments in the value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities are also reflected in our financial statements 
as a result  a decline in the value of the securities in our subsidiaries investment portfolios may materially reduce our net income or cause us to incur a significant loss 
for more information on our subsidiaries investment portfolios  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources investments on page our investments in alternative investments may be illiquid and volatile in terms of value and returns  which could negatively affect our investment income and liquidity 
in addition to fixed maturity securities  we have invested  and may from time to time continue to invest  in alternative investments such as private equity  fixed income  fixed income hedge  equity and real estate debt funds 
these and other similar investments may be illiquid due to restrictions on sales  transfers and redemptions  may have different  more significant risk characteristics than our investments in fixed maturity securities and may also have more volatile values and returns  all of which could negatively affect our investment income and liquidity 
as of december   we had an aggregate fair market value of million of such investments  which comprised of our total investments 
for more information on our alternative investments  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources investments on page the valuation of our investments may include methodologies  estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
fixed maturity and alternative investments  such as private equity  fixed income  fixed income hedge  equity and real estate debt funds  represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets 
these investments are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
fair value prices for all securities in the fixed maturities portfolio are independently provided by our investment custodian  investment accounting service provider and investment managers  each of which utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services 
we record the unadjusted price provided by our custodian  accounting service provider or manager  after we perform an internal validation process 
fair value for our alternative investments is estimated based primarily on 
table of contents the most recently reported net asset values reported by the fund manager  which we may adjust in our judgment following our internal review 
these valuation procedures for our alternative investments involve estimates and judgments  and during periods of market disruptions such as periods of significantly rising or high interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable 
in addition  there may be certain asset classes that are now in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to changes in the financial environment 
in these cases  the valuation of a greater number of securities in our investment portfolio may require more subjectivity and management judgment 
as a result  valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated or require greater estimation  which may result in values that could be less than the value at which the investments could ultimately be sold 
further  rapidly changing and unpredictable credit and equity market conditions could materially affect the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the nature of our business liquidity demands and the structure of our entities investment portfolios may adversely affect the performance of our investment portfolio and financial results and our investing flexibility 
we strive to structure our investments in a manner that recognizes our liquidity needs for future liabilities 
because of the unpredictable nature of losses that may arise under our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries insurance or reinsurance policies and as a result of our opportunistic commutation strategy  our liquidity needs can be substantial and may arise at any time 
in that regard  we attempt to correlate the maturity and duration of our investment portfolio to our general liability profile 
if we are unsuccessful in managing our investment portfolio within the context of this strategy  we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and at prices that are not optimal  and we may have difficulty in liquidating some of our alternative investments due to restrictions on sales  transfers and redemptions 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business and the performance of our investment portfolio 
we maintain each company within our organization and each acquired portfolio of insurance and reinsurance business in separate stand alone entities  and therefore  we have many individual portfolios of cash and investments 
each investment portfolio has its own regulatory admissibility requirements  and each entity is likely to have negative cash flows due to commutation activity  claims settlements and capital distributions 
these factors reduce our overall investing flexibility 
risks relating to laws and regulation insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate  and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations  or any investigations by government authorities  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive regulation under insurance laws and regulations of a number of jurisdictions 
existing laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  prescribe solvency and capital adequacy standards that they must meet and maintain  impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that they can hold to meet solvency and capital adequacy requirements and require them to maintain reserve liabilities 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to fines and penalties  restrict them from conducting business or result in commencement of insurance company delinquency proceedings against a non compliant insurance or reinsurance subsidiary 
the application of these laws and regulations may affect our liquidity and restrict our ability to expand our business operations through acquisitions or to pay dividends on our 
table of contents ordinary shares 
furthermore  compliance with legal and regulatory requirements may result in significant expenses  which could have a negative impact on our profitability 
to further understand these risks  see business regulation beginning on page in recent years  the insurance regulatory environment has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions 
regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders above other constituencies  including our shareholders 
additional laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted in the wake of the recent or future financial and credit crises that may have adverse effects on our business 
for example  under the dodd frank act  the united states has proposed a change from a state based system of regulation to a system involving more federal regulation under certain circumstances 
the dodd frank act also established the financial services oversight council  which is authorized to require supervision of certain significant non bank financial companies  including insurance companies  by the board of governors of the federal reserve 
the naic  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all us states and the district of columbia and state regulators  regularly re examines existing laws and regulations  which could impact our us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
in europe  solvency ii  the regulatory regime that is expected to be implemented in january  sets out new  strengthened eu wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the aim of increasing policyholder protection  instilling greater risk awareness and improving international competitiveness of eu insurers  which could lead to increases in our subsidiaries regulatory capital requirements  reduced operational flexibility and increased compliance costs 
in bermuda  the bma has implemented and imposed additional requirements on the companies it regulates  including certain of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  as part of its efforts to achieve equivalence under solvency ii 
overall  the future impact and effect of these and other future regulatory initiatives on our operations  financial condition and liquidity  including the amount of capital we would be required to hold and the costs of compliance  remains uncertain 
in addition to legal and regulatory requirements  the insurance and reinsurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of current investigations  litigation and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental and enforcement authorities  including the sec  concerning certain practices within the insurance and reinsurance industry 
with our pending acquisition of the hsbc insurance companies  our life insurance subsidiaries may be subject to life industry specific investigations  including ongoing industry wide investigations into compliance with unclaimed property laws and practices related to forced placed insurance 
insurance and reinsurance companies that we have acquired  or may acquire in the future  may have been or may become involved in these or other investigations and may have lawsuits filed against them 
our involvement in any investigations and related lawsuits would cause us to incur legal costs and  if we or any of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries were found to have violated any laws  we could be required to pay fines and damages  perhaps in material amounts 
if we fail to comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations  we may be subject to disciplinary action  damages  penalties or restrictions that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our subsidiaries may not have maintained or be able to maintain all required licenses and approvals or maintained or be able to maintain their businesses in full compliance with the laws and regulations to which they are subject  or the relevant insurance regulatory authority s interpretation of those laws and regulations 
in addition  some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if our subsidiaries do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities may preclude or suspend our subsidiaries from carrying on some or all of their activities  place one or more of them into rehabilitation or liquidation proceedings  or impose monetary penalties on them 
these types of actions may have a material adverse effect on our business and may preclude us from making future acquisitions or obtaining future engagements to manage companies and portfolios in run off 

table of contents risks relating to ownership of our ordinary shares our stock price may experience volatility  thereby causing a potential loss of value to our investors 
the market price for our ordinary shares may fluctuate substantially and could cause investment losses due to  among other things  the following factors announcements with respect to an acquisition or investment  changes in the value of our assets  our quarterly and annual operating results  sales  or the possibility or perception of future sales  by our existing shareholders  changes in general conditions in the economy and the insurance industry  the financial markets  and adverse press or news announcements 
a few significant shareholders may influence or control the direction of our business 
if the ownership of our ordinary shares continues to be highly concentrated  it may limit your ability and the ability of other shareholders to influence significant corporate decisions 
the interests of messrs 
silvester  o shea and packer  trident v  lp and its affiliates  or trident  beck mack oliver llc  or beck mack  and goldman  sachs co 
and its affiliates  or goldman sachs  may not be fully aligned with your interests  and this may lead to a strategy that is not in your best interest 
as of december   messrs 
silvester  o shea and packer  trident  beck mack and goldman sachs beneficially owned approximately     and  respectively  of our outstanding voting ordinary shares 
although they do not act as a group  trident  beck mack  goldman sachs and each of messrs 
silvester  o shea and packer may exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  and their concentrated holdings may delay or deter possible changes in control of enstar  which may reduce the market price of our ordinary shares 
some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions  limit voting rights of certain shareholders to or prevent the removal of our board of directors and management 
some provisions of our bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws make it difficult for any us shareholder or direct foreign shareholder group a shareholder or group of commonly controlled shareholders of enstar that are not us persons to own or control ordinary shares that constitute or more of the voting power of all of our ordinary shares 
the votes conferred by such shares will be reduced by whatever amount is necessary so that after any such reduction the votes conferred by such shares will constitute of the total voting power of all ordinary shares entitled to vote generally 
the primary purpose of this restriction is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  for us federal tax purposes 
however  this limit may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of our ordinary shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for a classified board  whose members may be removed by our shareholders only for cause by a majority vote  and contain restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors  submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and request special general meetings 

table of contents these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions may encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions may have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these bye law provisions may prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they may deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or may depress the market price of the shares 
there are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our ordinary shares 
insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate require prior notices or regulatory approval of changes in control of an insurer or its holding company 
different jurisdictions define changes in control differently  and generally any purchaser of or more of our ordinary shares could become subject to regulation and required to file certain notices and reports with the applicable insurance authorities although in certain jurisdictions these obligations apply to a purchaser of or more of our ordinary shares 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us  including transactions that some shareholders might consider to be desirable 
the market value of our ordinary shares may decline if large numbers of shares are sold  including pursuant to existing registration rights 
we have a registration rights agreement with mr 
silvester  trident and certain other of our shareholders 
this agreement provides that mr 
silvester and trident may request that we effect a registration under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act of certain of their ordinary shares 
in addition  they and the other shareholders party to the agreement have piggyback registration rights  which may result in their participation in an offering initiated by us 
we have also entered into a registration rights agreement with affiliates of goldman  sachs co 
in connection with our private placement in  which provides that these investors may make two requests that we effect a registration under the securities act of the ordinary shares and non voting ordinary shares issued to them in the private placement 
these investors also have piggyback registration rights with respect to our registration of ordinary shares for our own account or for the account of one or more of our shareholders 
as of december   an aggregate of approximately million ordinary shares held by mr 
silvester and trident and  ordinary shares and  non voting ordinary shares held by affiliates of goldman  sachs co 
are subject to these agreements 
by exercising their registration rights  these holders could cause a large number of ordinary shares to be registered and generally become freely tradable without restrictions under the securities act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration 
our ordinary shares have in the past been  and may from time to time continue to be  thinly traded  and significant sales  pursuant to the existing registration rights or otherwise  could adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares and impair our ability to raise capital through offerings of our equity securities 
because we are incorporated in bermuda  it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 
we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states 
all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states 
investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though we have appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers for violation of us federal securities laws  as such laws do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  
table of contents impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
we believe that there is doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would enforce judgments of us courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers  as well as our independent auditors  predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws or original actions brought in bermuda against us or these persons predicated solely upon us federal securities laws 
further  there is no treaty in effect between the united states and bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of us courts  and there are grounds upon which bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of us courts 
some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws  may not be allowed in bermuda courts as contrary to that jurisdiction s public policy 
because judgments of us courts are not automatically enforceable in bermuda  it may be difficult for you to recover against us based upon such judgments 
shareholders who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than shareholders of a us corporation 
the bermuda companies act  or the companies act  which applies to us  differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
as a result of these differences  shareholders who own our shares may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders who own shares of a us corporation 
for example  class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under bermuda law 
under bermuda law  only shareholders holding or more of our outstanding ordinary shares or numbering or more are entitled to propose a resolution at our general meeting 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares 
we do not intend to pay a cash dividend on our ordinary shares 
rather  we intend to use any retained earnings to fund the development and growth of our business 
from time to time  our board of directors will review our alternatives with respect to our earnings and seek to maximize value for our shareholders 
in the future  we may decide to commence a dividend program for the benefit of our shareholders 
any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our position as a holding company that lacks direct operations  the results of operations of our subsidiaries  our financial condition  cash requirements and prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
in addition  there are significant regulatory and other constraints that could prevent us from paying dividends in any event 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  on our ordinary shares may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of our ordinary shares under certain circumstances 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of ordinary shares under certain circumstances  including if it has reason to believe that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders may occur as a result of such transfer 
further  our bye laws provide us with the option to repurchase  or to assign to a third party the right to purchase  the minimum number of shares necessary to eliminate any such non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequence 
in addition  our board of directors may decline to approve or register a transfer of shares unless all applicable consents  authorizations  permissions or approvals of any governmental body or agency in bermuda  the united states or any other applicable jurisdiction required to be obtained prior to such transfer shall have been obtained 
the proposed transferor of any shares will be deemed to own those shares for dividend  voting and reporting purposes until a transfer of such shares has been registered on our shareholders register 

table of contents it is our understanding that while the precise form of the restrictions on transfer contained in our bye laws is untested  as a matter of general principle  restrictions on transfers are enforceable under bermuda law and are not uncommon 
these restrictions on transfer may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
risks relating to taxation we might incur unexpected us  us or australia tax liabilities if companies in our group that are incorporated outside those jurisdictions are determined to be carrying on a trade or business there 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are companies formed under the laws of bermuda or other jurisdictions that do not impose income taxes  it is our contemplation that these companies will not incur substantial income tax liabilities from their operations 
because the operations of these companies generally involve  or relate to  the insurance or reinsurance of risks that arise in higher tax jurisdictions  such as the united states  united kingdom and australia  it is possible that the taxing authorities in those jurisdictions may assert that the activities of one or more of these companies creates a sufficient nexus in that jurisdiction to subject the company to income tax there 
there are uncertainties in how the relevant rules apply to insurance businesses  and in our eligibility for favorable treatment under applicable tax treaties 
accordingly  it is possible that we could incur substantial unexpected tax liabilities 
us persons who own our ordinary shares might become subject to adverse us tax consequences as a result of related person insurance income  or rpii  if any  of our non us insurance company subsidiaries 
if the rpii rules of the code were to apply to us  a us person who owns our ordinary shares directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in income for us federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of our non us subsidiaries rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if that rpii were distributed proportionately to the us shareholders at that date regardless whether any actual distribution is made 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization would generally be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
although we and our subsidiaries intend to generally operate in a manner so as to qualify for certain exceptions to the rpii rules  there can be no assurance that these exceptions will be available 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that us persons who own our ordinary shares will not be required to recognize gross income inclusions attributable to rpii 
in addition  the rpii rules provide that if a shareholder who is a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance company that has rpii and in which us persons collectively own or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote  or the total value of the stock  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as dividend income to the extent of the shareholder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares whether or not those earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
such a shareholder would also be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares because we will not be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii rules  however  have not been interpreted by the courts or the us internal revenue service  or the irs  and regulations interpreting the rpii rules exist only in proposed form 
accordingly  there is no assurance that our views as to the inapplicability of these rules to a disposition of our ordinary shares will be accepted by the irs or a court 
us persons who own our ordinary shares would be subject to adverse tax consequences if we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries were considered a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we and our non us subsidiaries will not be pfics for us federal income purposes for the current year 
moreover  we do not expect to conduct our activities in a manner that will cause us or any of our 
table of contents non us subsidiaries to become a pfic in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
accordingly  it is possible that we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries might be deemed a pfic by the irs or a court for the current year or any future year 
if we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries were a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation  including subjecting the investor to a substantial acceleration and or increase in tax liability 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions of the code to an insurance company  so the application of those provisions to insurance companies remains unclear in certain respects 
us persons who own percent or more of our shares may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation  or cfc  rules 
a us person that is a us shareholder of a us corporation ie  a ie person who owns or is treated as owning at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the non us corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  that owns shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through non us entities on the last day of the cfc s taxable year  must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
subpart f income of a non us insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income such as interest  dividends and other types of passive income  as well as insurance and reinsurance income including underwriting and investment income 
a non us corporation is considered a cfc if non us shareholders own directly  indirectly through non us entities or by attribution by application of the constructive ownership rules of section b of the code ie  constructively more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of that foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of that foreign corporation 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a non us insurance company in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned directly  indirectly through non us entities or constructively by us shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
we believe that because of the dispersion of our share ownership  and provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power  no us person including our subsidiary enstar usa  inc  which owns certain of our non voting shares should be treated as owning directly  indirectly through non us entities or constructively or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our shares 
however  the irs could successfully challenge the effectiveness of these provisions in our organizational documents 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that a us person who owns our shares will not be characterized as a us shareholder 
changes in us federal income tax law could materially affect us or our shareholders 
legislation has been proposed on various occasions to eliminate perceived tax advantages of insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
for example  legislation has been proposed to disallow the deduction of reinsurance premiums paid by us companies to certain us affiliates  although no such provision has been enacted to date 
it is possible that such legislation could be enacted or similar legislation could be introduced in and enacted by the current congress or future congresses and enactment of some version of such legislation  or other changes in us tax laws  regulations or interpretations thereof  could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders

table of contents item legal proceedings in connection with our acquisition of seabright  two purported class action lawsuits were filed against seabright  the members of its board of directors  our merger subsidiary aml acquisition  corp 
and  in one of the cases  us 
the first suit was filed september  in the superior court of the state of washington and the second suit was filed september  in the court of chancery of the state of delaware 
the lawsuits allege  among other things  that seabright s directors breached their fiduciary duties when negotiating  approving and seeking stockholder approval of the merger  and that seabright and we or our merger subsidiary aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties 
in the suits  plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from taking any action to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement  as well as monetary damages  including attorneys fees and expenses 
we believe these suits are without merit 
nevertheless  in order to avoid the potential cost and distraction of continued litigation and to eliminate any risk of delay to the closing of the merger  we  seabright and the seabright director defendants agreed in principle to settle the two lawsuits  without admitting any liability or wrongdoing 
the settlement required seabright to make supplemental information available to its stockholders through a filing of a current report on form k with the us securities and exchange commission 
the settlement did not change the amount of the merger consideration that we paid to seabright s stockholders in any way  nor did it alter any deal terms 
the settlement is subject to execution and delivery of definitive documentation  approval by the washington court of the settlement and approval by the delaware court of the dismissal of the delaware suit 
if the settlement becomes effective  both lawsuits will be dismissed 
we are  from time to time  involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  including litigation regarding claims 
we do not believe that the resolution of any currently pending legal proceedings  either individually or taken as a whole  will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that lawsuits  arbitrations or other litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we anticipate that  similar to the rest of the insurance and reinsurance industry  we will continue to be subject to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of business  including litigation generally related to the scope of coverage with respect to asbestos and environmental claims 
there can be no assurance that any such future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

business overview we are a bermuda based company that acquires and manages insurance and reinsurance companies in run off and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run off  and provides management  consulting and other services to the insurance and reinsurance industry 
since our formation in august  we have acquired insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business and are now administering those businesses in run off 
we operate our business internationally through our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and our consulting subsidiaries in bermuda  the united states  the united kingdom  australia and europe 
we had a total of employees as at december  key performance indicators the financial measure that we believe is most meaningful in analyzing our performance and assessing whether we are achieving our objectives is growth in book value per share 
as of december  and  book value per share and diluted book value per share were as follows as of december  as of december  book value per share diluted book value per share our principal business consists of acquiring and managing property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies that have ceased underwriting new business meaning they are in run off 
we believe growth in our net book value is driven primarily by growth in our net earnings  which is in turn driven in large part by successfully completing new acquisitions and effectively managing companies and portfolios of business that we previously acquired 
we generate our earnings in the following ways settling net loss reserves of acquired businesses below their acquired fair value  generating investment income on the cash and investment portfolios of acquired businesses  
table of contents in some cases  purchasing companies at a discount to the fair value of the assets acquired  which has resulted in the recording of gains on bargain purchases  and providing expert run off management services for a fixed and or incentive based fee in cases where vendors are not ready or able to dispose of their run off operations  but require third party services to stabilize the business and  where possible  add value to the core business 
during the year ended december   our book value per share on a basic and diluted basis increased by and  respectively 
the increase in both basic and diluted book value per share was principally due to our net earnings for the year 
drivers of profitability net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities our insurance related earnings comprise primarily reductions  or potential increases  of net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities 
these liabilities are comprised of outstanding loss or case reserves or olr  losses incurred but not reported or ibnr and unallocated loss adjustment expenses or ulae reserves 
net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities established by management utilizing analysis performed by independent actuaries prepared on an annual basis are reviewed by our management each quarter 
reserves reflect management s best estimate of the remaining unpaid portion of these liabilities 
prior period estimates of net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities may change as our management considers the combined impact of commutations  policy buy backs  settlement of losses on carried reserves and the trend of incurred loss development compared to prior forecasts 
net reductions in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are reported as negative expenses by us 
for more information on how the reserves are calculated  see critical accounting policies loss and loss adjustment expenses on page net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains our net investment income is a function of the average invested assets and the average yield that we earn on those invested assets 
the investment yield on our fixed maturity investments is a function of market interest rates as well as the credit quality and duration of our fixed maturities portfolio 
our net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments includes realized gains and losses on our fixed maturity securities and changes in fair value of our trading securities and other investments 
we recognize realized gains and losses at the time of sale  and these gains and losses  along with the changes in fair value of our trading securities  reflect the results of changing market conditions  including changes in market interest rates and changes in the market s perception of the credit quality of our fixed maturity holdings 
the change in fair value of other investments is principally a function of the success of the funds in which we are invested  which depends on  among other things  the underlying strategies of the funds  the ability of the fund managers to execute the fund strategies and general economic and investment market conditions 
consulting fee income we generate consulting fees based on a combination of fixed and success based fee arrangements 
consulting income will vary from period to period depending on the timing of completion of success based fee arrangements 
success based fees are recorded when targets related to overall project completion or profitability goals are achieved 
expenses salaries and benefits we are a service based company and  as such  employee salaries and benefits are our largest expense 
we have experienced significant increases in our salaries and benefits expenses as we have grown our operations  and we expect that trend to continue if we are able to expand our operations successfully 

table of contents we provide for the annual grant of bonus compensation to our officers and employees  including our senior executive officers 
bonus awards are based on a percentage of our consolidated net after tax profits 
the percentage is unless our compensation committee exercises its discretion to change the percentage no later than days after our year end 
bonus awards are payable in cash  ordinary shares or a combination of both 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include rent and rent related costs  professional fees legal  investment  audit and actuarial and travel expenses 
we have operations in multiple jurisdictions and our employees travel frequently in connection with the search for acquisition opportunities and in the general management of the business 
income taxes we have operations in multiple jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are subject to taxation 
income tax expense is generated through our foreign operations outside of bermuda 
our income tax expense will fluctuate depending on the geographic distribution of pre tax net income 
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest relates to the share of earnings of seven of our subsidiaries that is not attributable to us because a third party has an interest in such subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies we believe the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
accounting for acquisitions fair value measurement we use the purchase method in accounting for acquisitions 
the difference between the fair value of net assets acquired and purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the most significant liability of an acquired company is typically the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses  and the most significant asset is typically the asset related to any reinsurance recoverable on these liabilities that may be contractually due to the acquired entity 
the market for acquisition of run off companies is not sufficiently active and transparent to enable us to identify reliable  market exit values for acquired assets and liabilities 
accordingly  consistent with provisions of us gaap  we have developed internal models that we believe allow us to determine fair values that are reasonable proxies for market exit values 
we are familiar with the major participants in the acquisition run off market and believe that the key assumptions we make in valuing acquired assets and liabilities are consistent with the kinds of assumptions made by such market participants 
furthermore  in our negotiation of purchase price with sellers  it is frequently clear to us that other bidders in the market are using models and assumptions similar in nature to ours during the competitive bid process 
the majority of acquisitions are completed following a public tender process whereby the seller invites market participants to provide bids for the target acquisition 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the acquirer record the assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
the fair values of each of the reinsurance assets and liabilities acquired are derived from probability weighted ranges of the associated projected cash flows  based on actuarially prepared information and management s run off strategy 
our run off strategy  as well as that of other run off market participants  is expected to be different from the seller s as generally sellers are not specialized in running off insurance and reinsurance liabilities whereas we and other market participants do specialize in such run offs 

table of contents the key assumptions used by us and  we believe  by other run off market participants in the fair valuation of acquired companies are i the projected payout  timing and amounts of claims liabilities  ii the related projected timing and amount of reinsurance collections  iii a risk free discount rate  which is applied to determine the present value of the future cash flows  iv the estimated unallocated loss adjustment expenses to be incurred over the life of the run off  v the impact of any accelerated run off strategy  and vi an appropriate risk margin 
the probability weighted projected cash flows of the acquired company are based on projected claims payouts provided by the seller predominantly in the form of the seller s most recent independent actuarial reserve report 
in the absence of the seller s actuarial reserve report  our independent actuaries will determine the estimated claims payout 
with respect to our uk  bermudian and australian insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  we are able to pursue strategies to achieve complete finality and conclude the run off of a company by promoting solvent schemes of arrangement 
solvent schemes of arrangement are a popular means of achieving financial certainty and finality for insurance and reinsurance companies incorporated or managed in the uk  bermuda and australia by making a one time full and final settlement of an insurance and reinsurance company s liabilities to policyholders 
on acquisition of a uk  bermudian or australian company  the claims payout projection is weighted according to management s estimated probability of being able to complete a solvent scheme of arrangement 
to the extent that solvent schemes of arrangement are not available to an acquired company  no weighting is applied to the projected claims payout 
on acquisition  we make a provision for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities 
this provision considers the adequacy of the provision maintained and recorded by the seller in light of our run off strategy and estimated unallocated loss adjustment expenses to be incurred over the life of the acquired run off as projected by the seller s actuaries or  in their absence  our actuaries 
to the extent that our estimate of the total unallocated loss adjustment expense provision is different from the seller s  an adjustment will be made 
while it is our objective to accelerate the run off by completing commutations of assumed and ceded business which would have the effect of shortening the life  and therefore the cost  of the run off  the success of this strategy is far from certain 
therefore  the estimates of unallocated loss adjustment expenses are based on running off the liabilities and assets over the actuarially projected life of the run off 
in those domiciles where solvent schemes of arrangement are available  management s estimates of the total unallocated loss adjustment expenses are probability weighted in accordance with the estimated time that a solvent scheme of arrangement could be completed  which has the effect of reducing the period of the run off and the related unallocated loss adjustment expenses 
for those acquisitions in domiciles where solvent schemes of arrangement are not available  the unallocated loss adjustment expenses are estimated over the projected life of the run off 
we believe that providing for unallocated loss adjustment expenses based on our run off strategy is appropriate in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition of a run off company 
we believe that other participants in the run off acquisition marketplace factor into the price to pay for an acquisition the estimated cost of running off the acquired company based on how that participant expects to manage the assets and liabilities 
the difference between the original carrying value of reinsurance liabilities and reinsurance assets acquired at the date of acquisition and the fair value is recorded as an intangible asset or other liability  which we refer to as the fair value adjustment  or fva 
the fva is amortized over the estimated payout period and adjusted for accelerations on commutation settlements or any other new information or subsequent change in circumstances after the date of acquisition 
to the extent the actual payout experience after the acquisition is materially faster or slower than anticipated at the time of the acquisition  there is an adjustment to the estimated ultimate loss reserves  or there are changes in bad debt provisions or in estimates of future run off costs following accelerated payouts  then the amortization of the fva is accelerated or decelerated  as the case may be  to reflect such changes 
the fva is tested annually for impairment 

table of contents loss and loss adjustment expenses our primary objective in running off the operations of acquired companies and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run off is to increase book value by settling loss reserves below their acquired fair value 
the earnings created in each acquired company or portfolio of insurance and reinsurance business  together with the related decrease in loss reserves  lead to a reduction in the capital required for each company  thereby providing the ability to distribute both earnings and excess capital to the parent company 
to the extent that the nature of the acquired loss reserves are conducive to commutation  our aim is to settle the majority of the acquired loss reserves within a timeframe of approximately five to seven years from the date of acquisition 
to the extent that acquired reserves are not conducive to commutation  we will instead adopt a disciplined claims management approach to pay only valid claims on a timely basis and endeavor to reduce the level of acquired loss adjustment expense provisions by withdrawing  where appropriate  from existing litigation and otherwise streamlining claims handling procedures 
by adopting either of the above run off strategies  we would expect that over the targeted life of the run off  acquired ultimate loss reserves would settle below their recorded fair value  resulting in reductions in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will successfully implement our strategy 
commutations of blocks of policies  along with disciplined claims management  have the potential to produce favorable claims development compared to established reserves 
for each newly acquired company  we determine a commutation strategy that broadly identifies commutation targets using the following criteria previous commutations completed by existing portfolio companies with policyholders of the newly acquired company  nature of liabilities  size of incurred loss reserves  recent loss development history  and targets for claims audits 
once commutation targets are identified  they are prioritized into target years of completion 
at the beginning of each year  the approach to commutation negotiations is determined by the commutation team  including claims and exposure analysis and broker account reconciliations 
on completion of this analysis  settlement parameters are set around incurred liabilities 
commutation discussions can take many months or even years to come to fruition 
commutation targets not completed in a particular year are re prioritized for the following year 
every commutation  irrespective of value  requires the approval of our chief financial officer or one of our two joint chief operating officers 
the impact of the commutation activity on the ibnr reserve is reflected as part of our annual actuarial reviews of reserves 
however  if a significant commutation is completed during the year  loss reserves will be adjusted in the corresponding quarter to reflect management s then best estimate of the impact on remaining ibnr reserves

the reserve for ibnr net of reinsurance balance recoverable accounted for  million  or  of our total net loss reserves at december  annual loss and loss adjustment reviews because a significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk  the occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance or reinsurance company and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event  the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based largely upon estimates 

table of contents our management must use considerable judgment in the process of developing these estimates 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty business includes amounts determined from loss reports on individual cases and amounts for ibnr reserves 
such reserves  including ibnr reserves  are estimated by management based upon loss reports received from ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of losses for which no ceding company loss reports have yet been received and the results of annual independent actuarial studies 
loss advices or reports from ceding companies are generally provided via the placing broker and comprise treaty statements  individual claims files  electronic messages and large loss advices or cash calls 
large loss advices and cash calls are provided to us as soon as practicable after an individual loss or claim is made or settled by the insured 
the remaining broker advices are issued monthly  quarterly or annually depending on the provisions of the individual policies or the ceding company s practice 
for certain direct insurance policies where the claims are managed by third party administrators tpa s and managing general agents mga s  loss bordereaux are received either monthly or quarterly depending on the arrangement with the tpa and mga 
where we provide reinsurance or retrocession reinsurance protection  the process of claim advice from the direct insurer to the reinsurers and or retrocessionaires naturally involves more levels of communication  which inevitably creates delays or lags in the receipt of loss advice by the reinsurers retrocessionaires relative to the date of first advice to the direct insurer 
certain types of exposure  typically latent health exposures such as asbestos related claims  have inherently long reporting delays  in some cases many years  from the date a loss occurred to the manifestation and reporting of a claim and ultimately until the final settlement of the claim 
for asbestos and environmental exposures  our actuaries apply explicit time lag assumptions in their reserving methodologies 
this time lag varies by portfolio from one to five years depending on the relative mix of domicile  percentages of product mix of insurance  reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance  primary insurance  excess reinsurance  reinsurance of direct and reinsurance of reinsurance within any given exposure category 
exposure portfolios written from a non us domicile are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios written from a us domicile 
portfolios with a larger proportion of reinsurance exposures are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios with a larger proportion of insurance exposures 
an industry wide weakness in cedant reporting affects the adequacy and accuracy of reserving for advised claims 
we attempt to mitigate this inherent weakness as follows we closely monitor cedant loss reporting and  for those cedants identified as providing inadequate  untimely or unusual reporting of losses  we conduct  in accordance with the provisions of the insurance and reinsurance contracts  detailed claims audits at the insured s or reinsured s premises 
such claims audits have the benefit of validating advised claims  determining whether the cedant s loss reserving practices and reporting are adequate and identifying potential loss reserving issues of which our actuaries need to be made aware 
any required adjustments to advised claims reserves reported by cedants identified during the claims audits will be recorded as an adjustment to the advised case reserve 
onsite claims audits are often supplemented by further reviews by our internal and external legal advisors to determine the reasonableness of advised case reserves and  if considered necessary  an adjustment to the reported case reserve will be recorded 
our actuaries project expected paid and incurred loss development for each class of business  which is monitored on a quarterly basis 
should actual paid and incurred development differ significantly from the expected paid and incurred development  we will investigate the cause and  in conjunction with our actuaries  consider whether any adjustment to ultimate loss reserves is required 
our actuaries consider the quality of ceding company data as part of their ongoing evaluation of the liability for ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses  and the methodologies they select for estimating ultimate losses inherently compensate for potential weaknesses in this data  including weaknesses in loss reports provided by cedants 

table of contents we strive to apply the highest standards of discipline and professionalism to our claims adjusting  processing and settlement and disputes with cedants are rare 
however  we are from time to time involved in various disputes and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our claims adjusting process 
the majority of the losses ceded to us are from the subscription insurance market where there are often many insurers and reinsurers underwriting each policy  and we often are involved in disputes commenced by other co insurers who act in unison with any litigation or dispute resolution controlled by the lead underwriter 
coverage disputes arise when the insured reinsured and insurer reinsurer cannot reach agreement as to the interpretation of the policy and or application of the policy to a claim 
most insurance and reinsurance policies contain dispute resolution clauses requiring arbitration or mediation 
in the absence of a contractual dispute resolution process  civil litigation would be commenced 
we aim to reach a commercially acceptable resolution to any dispute  using arbitration or litigation as a last resort 
we regularly monitor and provide internal reports on disputes involving arbitration and litigation and engage external legal counsel to provide professional advice and assist with case management 
in establishing reserves  management includes amounts for ibnr reserves using information from independent actuarial estimates of ultimate losses 
our independent actuaries use generally accepted actuarial methodologies to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses and those estimates are reviewed by our management 
nearly all of our unpaid claims liabilities are considered to have a long claims payout tail 
gross loss reserves relate primarily to casualty exposures  including latent claims  of which approximately relate to asbestos and environmental  or a e  exposures 
within the annual loss reserve studies produced by our independent actuaries  exposures for each subsidiary are separated into homogeneous reserving categories for the purpose of estimating ibnr 
each reserving category contains either direct insurance or assumed reinsurance reserves and groups relatively similar types of risks and exposures for example  asbestos  environmental  casualty  property and lines of business written for example  marine  aviation  non marine 
based on the exposure characteristics and the nature of available data for each individual reserving category  a number of methodologies are applied 
recorded reserves for each category are selected from the indications produced by the various methodologies after consideration of exposure characteristics  data limitations and strengths and weaknesses of each method applied 
this approach to estimating ibnr has been consistently adopted in the annual loss reserve studies for each period presented 
we review the external actuaries reports for consistency and appropriateness of methodology and assumptions  including assumptions of industry benchmarks  and discuss any concerns or changes with them 
our chief actuary and chief financial officer then consider the reasonableness of loss reserves recommended by our external actuaries  in light of actual loss development during the year  using the following reports produced internally on a quarterly basis for each of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries gross  ceded and net incurred loss report this report provides  for each reporting period  the total including commuted policies gross  ceded and net incurred loss development for each company and a commentary on each company s loss development prepared by our chief actuary 
the report highlights the causes of any unusual or significant loss development activity including commutations and includes commentary on quality and reliability of underlying data 
actual versus expected gross incurred loss development report this report provides a summary  and commentary thereon  of each company s excluding companies or portfolios of business acquired in the current year non commuted incurred gross losses compared to the estimate of the development of non commuted incurred gross losses provided by our external actuaries at the beginning of the year as part of the prior year s reserving process 
commutations summary schedule this schedule summarizes all commutations completed during the year for all companies  and identifies the policyholder with which we commuted  the incurred losses settled by the commutation comprising outstanding unpaid losses and case reserves and the amount of the commutation settlement 

table of contents analysis of paid  incurred and ultimate losses this analysis for each company  and in the aggregate  provides a summary of the gross  ceded and net paid and incurred losses and the impact of applying our external actuaries recommended loss reserves 
this report  reviewed in conjunction with the previous reports  provides an analytical tool to review each company s incurred loss or gain and reduction in ibnr reserves to assess whether the ultimate reduction in loss reserves appears reasonable in light of known developments within each company 
the above reports provide our chief actuary and chief financial officer with the relevant information to determine whether loss development including commutations during the year has  for each company  been sufficiently meaningful so as to warrant an adjustment to the reserves recommended by our external actuaries in the most recent actuarial study 
it is not possible to quantify how much of any reserve release specifically relates to commutations or favorable development of non commuted claims as the revised historical loss development used by the actuaries to estimate required reserves is a combination of both the elimination of historical loss development relating to commuted policies and non commuted loss development 
when establishing loss reserves we have an expectation that  in the absence of commutations and significant favorable or unfavorable non commuted loss development compared to expectations  loss reserves will not exceed the high  or be less than the low  end of the following ranges of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves implied by the various methodologies used by each of our insurance subsidiaries as of december  the ranges of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves implied by the various methodologies used by each of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries as of december  were low selected high in thousands of us dollars asbestos environmental all other general casualty workers compensation personal accident marine  aviation and transit construction defect other total all other unallocated loss adjustment expenses total latent claims our loss reserves are related largely to casualty exposures including latent exposures relating primarily to a e 
in establishing the reserves for unpaid claims  management considers facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation 
liabilities are recognized for known claims including the cost of related litigation when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy and management can reasonably estimate its liability 
in addition  reserves are established to cover loss development related to both known and unasserted claims 
the estimation of unpaid claim liabilities is subject to a high degree of uncertainty for a number of reasons 
first  unpaid claim liabilities for property and casualty exposures in general are impacted by changes in the legal environment  jury awards  medical cost trends and general inflation 
moreover  for latent exposures in particular  developed case law and adequate claim history do not exist 
there is significant coverage litigation related to 
table of contents these exposures  which creates further uncertainty in the estimation of the liabilities 
as a result  for these types of exposures  it is especially unclear whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using reserving techniques that extrapolate losses to an ultimate basis using loss development factors  and the uncertainties surrounding the estimation of unpaid claim liabilities are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
there can be no assurance that the reserves we establish will be adequate or will not be adversely affected by the development of other latent exposures 
our asbestos claims are primarily products liability claims submitted by a variety of insureds who operated in different parts of the asbestos distribution chain 
while most such claims arise from asbestos mining and primary asbestos manufacturers  we have also been receiving claims from tertiary defendants such as smaller manufacturers  and the industry has seen an emerging trend of non products claims arising from premises exposures 
unlike products claims  primary policies generally do not contain aggregate policy limits for premises claims  which  accordingly  remain at the primary layer and  thus  rarely impact excess insurance policies 
as the vast majority of our policies are excess policies  this trend has had only a marginal effect on our asbestos exposures thus far 
asbestos reform efforts have been underway at both the federal and state level to address the cost and scope of asbestos claims to the american economy 
while congressional efforts to create a federal trust fund that would replace the tort system for asbestos claims failed  several states  including texas and florida  have passed reforms based on medical criteria requiring certain levels of medically documented injury before a lawsuit can be filed  generally resulting in a drop of case filings in those states adopting this reform measure 
asbestos claims primarily fall into two general categories impaired and unimpaired bodily injury claims 
property damage claims represent only a small fraction of asbestos claims 
impaired claims primarily include individuals suffering from mesothelioma or a cancer such as lung cancer 
unimpaired claims include asbestosis and those whose lung regions contain pleural plaques 
unlike traditional property and casualty insurers that either have large numbers of individual claims arising from personal lines such as auto  or small numbers of high value claims as in medical malpractice insurance lines  our primary exposures arise from a e claims that do not follow a consistent pattern 
for instance  we may encounter a small insured with one large environmental claim due to significant groundwater contamination  while a fortune company may submit numerous claims for relatively small values 
moreover  there is no set pattern for the life of an environmental or asbestos claim 
some of these claims may resolve within two years whereas others have remained unresolved for nearly two decades 
therefore  our open and closed claims data do not follow any identifiable or discernible pattern 
furthermore  because of the reinsurance nature of the claims we manage  we focus on the activities at the reinsured level rather than at the individual claims level 
the counterparties with whom we typically interact are generally insurers or large industrial concerns and not individual claimants 
claims do not follow any consistent pattern 
they arise from many insureds or locations and in a broad range of circumstances 
an insured may present one large claim or hundreds or thousands of small claims 
plaintiffs counsel frequently aggregate thousands of claims within one lawsuit 
the deductibles to which claims are subject vary from policy to policy and year to year 
often claims data is only available to reinsurers  such as us  on an aggregated basis 
accordingly  we have not found claim count information or average reserve amounts to be reliable indicators of exposure for our reserve estimation process or for management of our liabilities 
we have found data accumulation and claims management more effective and meaningful at the reinsured level rather than at the underlying claim level 
as a result  we have designed our reserving methodologies to be independent of claim count information 
as the level of exposures to a reinsured can vary substantially  we focus on the aggregate exposures and pursue commutations and policy buy backs with the larger reinsureds 
as of december   we employed approximately full time equivalent employees  including attorneys  actuaries  and experienced claims handlers  to directly administer our a e liabilities 

table of contents our future environmental loss development may be influenced by other factors including existence of currently undiscovered polluted sites eligible for clean up under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act or cercla and related legislation 
costs imposed due to joint and several liability if not all potentially reliable parties or prps are capable of paying their share 
success of legal challenges to certain policy terms such as the absolute pollution exclusion 
potential future reforms and amendments to cercla  particularly as the resources of superfund the funding vehicle  established as part of cercla  to provide financing for cleanup of polluted sites where no prp can be identified become exhausted 
the influence of each of these factors is not easily quantifiable and  as with asbestos related exposures  our historical environmental loss development is of limited value in determining future environmental loss development using traditional actuarial reserving techniques 
there have been recent positive developments concerning lead paint liability  an area previously viewed as an emerging trend in latent claim activity with the potential to adversely affect reserves 
after a series of successful defense efforts by defendant lead pigment manufacturers in lead paint litigation  in  a rhode island trial court ruled in favor of the government in a nuisance claim against the defendant manufacturers 
since the rhode island decision  other government entities have employed the same theory for recovery against these manufacturers 
in  the rhode island supreme court reversed the sole legal liability loss experienced by lead pigment manufacturers in lead paint litigation 
the court rejected public nuisance as a viable theory of liability for use by the government against the defendants and thus invalidated the entire claim against the lead pigment manufacturers 
subsequent to the rhode island supreme court decision at least one other government entity  an ohio municipality  voluntarily dropped its lead paint suit 
thereafter  the state of ohio  voluntarily dismissed its pending action against lead pigment manufacturers 
other state supreme courts equally rejected the public nuisance theory of liability  whereas no highest state court has ever adopted this theory as an acceptable cause of action 
we believe that lead paint claims now pose a lower risk to adverse reserve adjustment than previously thought  as the only trial court decision against lead pigment manufacturers to date was reversed on the basis that public nuisance is an improper liability theory by which a plaintiff may seek recovery against the lead pigment manufacturers 
even if adverse rulings under alternative theories succeed or if other states ultimately permit recovery under a public nuisance theory  it is questionable whether insureds have coverage under their policies under which they seek indemnity 
insureds have yet to meet policy terms and conditions to establish coverage for lead paint public nuisance claims  as opposed to traditional bodily injury and property damage claims 
still  there is the potential for significant impact to excess insurers should plaintiffs prevail in successive nuisance claims pending in other jurisdictions and coverage is established 
our independent  external actuaries use industry benchmarking methodologies to estimate appropriate ibnr reserves for our a e exposures 
these methods are based on comparisons of our loss experience on a e exposures relative to industry loss experience on a e exposures 
estimates of ibnr are derived separately for each of our relevant subsidiaries and  for some subsidiaries  separately for distinct portfolios of exposure 
the discussion that follows describes  in greater detail  the primary actuarial methodologies used by our independent actuaries to estimate ibnr for a e exposures 
in addition to the specific considerations for each method described below  many general factors are considered in the application of the methods and the interpretation of results for each portfolio of exposures 
these factors include the mix of product types eg  primary insurance versus reinsurance of primary versus reinsurance of reinsurance  the average attachment point of coverages eg  first dollar primary versus umbrella over primary versus high excess  payment and reporting lags related to the international domicile of our 
table of contents subsidiaries  payment and reporting pattern acceleration due to large wholesale settlements eg  policy buy backs and commutations pursued by us  and lists of individual risks remaining and general trends within the legal and tort environments 
paid survival ratio method 
in this method  our expected annual average payment amount is multiplied by an expected future number of payment years to get an indicated reserve 
our historical calendar year payments are examined to determine an expected future annual average payment amount 
this amount is multiplied by an expected number of future payment years to estimate a reserve 
trends in calendar year payment activity are considered when selecting an expected future annual average payment amount 
accepted industry benchmarks are used in determining an expected number of future payment years 
each year  annual payments data is updated  trends in payments are re evaluated and changes to benchmark future payment years are reviewed 
advantages of this method are of ease of application and simplicity of assumptions 
a potential disadvantage of the method is that results could be misleading for portfolios of high excess exposures where significant payment activity has not yet begun 
paid market share method 
in this method  our estimated market share is applied to the industry estimated unpaid losses 
the ratio of our historical calendar year payments to industry historical calendar year payments is examined to estimate our market share 
this ratio is then applied to the estimate of industry unpaid losses 
each year  calendar year payment data is updated for both us and industry  estimates of industry unpaid losses are reviewed and the selection of our estimated market share is revisited 
this method has the advantage that trends in calendar year market share can be incorporated into the selection of company share of remaining market payments 
a potential disadvantage of this method is that it is particularly sensitive to assumptions regarding the time lag between industry payments and our payments 
reserve to paid method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry reserves to industry paid to date losses is multiplied by our paid to date losses to estimate our reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the completeness of our paid to date loss information  the potential acceleration or deceleration in our payments relative to the industry due to our claims handling practices  and the impact of large individual settlements 
each year  paid to date loss information is updated for both us and the industry and updates to industry estimated reserves are reviewed 
this method has the advantage of relying purely on paid loss data and so is not influenced by subjectivity of case reserve loss estimates 
a potential disadvantage is that the application to our portfolios that do not have complete inception to date paid loss history could produce misleading results 
to address this potential disadvantage  a variation of the method is also considered by multiplying the ratio of estimated industry reserves to industry losses paid during a recent period of time eg  years times our paid losses during that period 
ibnr case ratio method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry ibnr reserves to industry case reserves is multiplied by our case reserves to estimate our ibnr reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the presence of policies reserved at policy limits  changes in overall industry case reserve adequacy and recent loss reporting history 
each year  our case reserves are updated  industry reserves are updated and the applicability of the industry ibnr case ratio is reviewed 
this method has the advantage that it incorporates the most recent estimates of amounts needed to settle open cases included in current case reserves 
a potential disadvantage is that results could be misleading where our case reserve adequacy differs significantly from overall industry case reserve adequacy 
ultimate to incurred method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry ultimate losses to industry incurred to date losses is applied to our incurred to date losses to estimate our ibnr reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the completeness of our incurred to date loss information  the potential acceleration or deceleration in our incurred losses relative to the industry due to our claims handling practices and the impact of large individual settlements 
each year incurred to date loss information is updated for both us and the industry and updates to industry estimated ultimate losses are reviewed 
this method has the advantage that it incorporates both paid and case reserve information in projecting 
table of contents ultimate losses 
a potential disadvantage is that results could be misleading where cumulative paid loss data is incomplete or where our case reserve adequacy differs significantly from overall industry case reserve adequacy 
under the paid survival ratio method  the paid market share method and the reserve to paid method  we first determine the estimated total reserve and then deduct the reported outstanding case reserves to arrive at an estimated ibnr reserve 
the ibnr case ratio method first determines an estimated ibnr reserve which is then added to the advised outstanding case reserves to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve 
the ultimate to incurred method first determines an estimate of the ultimate losses to be paid and then deducts paid to date losses to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve and then deducts outstanding case reserves to arrive at the estimated ibnr reserve 
as of december   we had separate insurance and or reinsurance subsidiaries whose reserves are categorized into approximately reserve categories in total  including distinct asbestos reserving categories and distinct environmental reserving categories 
to the extent that data availability allows  the five methodologies described above are applied for each of the asbestos reserving categories and each of the environmental reserving categories 
as is common in actuarial practice  no one methodology is exclusively or consistently relied upon when selecting a recorded reserve 
consistent reliance on a single methodology to select a recorded reserve would be inappropriate in light of the dynamic nature of both the a e liabilities in general  and our actual exposure portfolios in particular 
in selecting a recorded reserve  management considers the range of results produced by the methods  and the strengths and weaknesses of the methods in relation to the data available and the specific characteristics of the portfolio under consideration 
trends in both our data and industry data are also considered in the reserve selection process 
recent trends or changes in the relevant tort and legal environments are also considered when assessing methodology results and selecting an appropriate recorded reserve amount for each portfolio 
the following key assumptions were used to estimate a e reserves at december  billion ultimate industry asbestos losses this level of industry wide losses and its comparison to industry wide paid  incurred and outstanding case reserves is the base benchmarking assumption applied to paid market share  reserve to paid  ibnr case ratio and the ultimate to incurred asbestos reserving methodologies 
billion ultimate industry environmental losses this level of industry wide losses and its comparison to industry wide paid  incurred and outstanding case reserves is the base benchmarking assumption applied to paid market share  reserve to paid  ibnr case ratio and the ultimate to incurred environmental reserving methodologies 
loss reporting lag our subsidiaries assumed a mix of insurance and reinsurance exposures generally through the london market 
as the available industry benchmark loss information  as supplied by our independent consulting actuaries  is compiled largely from us direct insurance company experience  our loss reporting is expected to lag relative to available industry benchmark information 
this time lag used by each of our insurance subsidiaries varies from to years depending on the relative mix of domicile  percentages of product mix of insurance  reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance  primary insurance  excess insurance  reinsurance of direct  and reinsurance of reinsurance within any given exposure category 
exposure portfolios written from a non us domicile are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios written from a us domicile 
portfolios with a larger proportion of reinsurance exposures are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios with a larger proportion of insurance exposures 
the assumptions above as to ultimate industry asbestos and environmental losses have not changed from the immediately preceding period 
for our company as a whole  the average selected lag for asbestos has 
table of contents increased slightly from years to years and the average selected lag for environmental has decreased slightly from years to years 
the changes to the selected lags arose largely as a result of the changes in the relative sizes of the various underlying asbestos and environmental portfolios during the following tables provide a summary of the impact of changes in industry ultimate losses  from the selected billion for asbestos and billion for environmental  and changes in the time lag  from the selected averages of years for asbestos and years for environmental  for us behind industry development that it is assumed relates to our insurance and reinsurance companies 
please note that the table below demonstrates sensitivity to changes to key assumptions using methodologies selected for determining loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses  or alae  at december  and differs from the table on page  which demonstrates the range of outcomes produced by the various methodologies

in the period from  industry publications generally indicated that the range of ultimate industry asbestos losses was estimated to be between approximately billion and billion 
in late  one commonly referenced benchmark increased its estimate of ultimate industry asbestos losses from billion to billion 
one of the reasons cited for this higher estimate was a shift of losses away from products liability claims to non products claims 
in considering the impact of this issue on our owned portfolios of asbestos exposures  it is important to understand how asbestos claims attach to policies issued by the insurance industry in general and to the policies issued by the companies owned by us in particular 
historically  asbestos claims have been presented as products liability claims brought against manufacturers and distributors of asbestos containing products 
for a given manufacturer  distributor  or other entity involved in asbestos litigation  multiple claims are filed by numerous individuals 
there is typically an allocation of the settlement costs for asbestos claims over time based on exposure to asbestos by the injured claimants 
many asbestos claims will aggregate within each individual policy period to exhaust the annual aggregate policy limits that exist within policies sold to cover products liability claims 
beginning in the mid s  a trend began to emerge whereby certain policyholders began to assert that their asbestos claims should not fall within the products liability section of their policies and  therefore  should 
table of contents not be subject to the aggregate limits of products liability claims 
instead  the policyholder would assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the premises operations section of their policies 
under such presentation  individual claim or occurrence limits apply separately to each claim and there is no aggregate limit for the amount of premises or non products claims within a particular policy 
our exposure to asbestos losses arises largely from direct excess policies and assumed reinsurance policies written through the london market 
with respect to direct excess policies  our companies typically participated on policies whereby liability would only attach in excess of primary and umbrella policy limits 
as non products asbestos losses are not aggregated and are generally confined to the limits of the primary and other lower layer insurance policies  we believe we have very little exposure to non products asbestos losses through direct insurance policies issued by our subsidiary companies 
to date  we have seen no material reporting of non products asbestos claims on direct insurance policies 
the trend of asbestos losses shifting from products to non products is not a new phenomenon 
as our insurance entities have not received any material reporting of non products claims to date and their direct insurance exposures are generally in excess of the layers of insurance impacted by non products asbestos losses  we do not expect any material future liability in respect of non products asbestos claims 
losses with respect to assumed reinsurance exposures to non products asbestos claims are unlikely to be aggregated and are generally confined to the limits of the primary and other lower layer insurance policies 
there is limited ability for such claims to exceed retained levels 
our assumed reinsurance portfolio with respect to asbestos exposures is largely excess of loss in nature and  therefore  not especially subject to non products asbestos liabilities 
to date  we have seen no material reporting of non products asbestos claims on assumed reinsurance policies 
as stated above  the trend of asbestos losses shifting from products to non products is not a new phenomenon 
as our assumed reinsurance entities have not received any material reporting of non products claims to date and their assumed reinsurance exposures generally cover layers of insurance not impacted by non products asbestos losses  management does not expect any material future liability in respect of non products asbestos claims 
other reasons cited for the increase in estimated industry ultimate asbestos losses include the ongoing uncertainty surrounding insurance coverage of asbestos claims and the ongoing reporting of significant numbers and values of malignant mesothelioma claims 
we do not view these issues as new information  and therefore  any impact has already been factored into our actuarial reserving methodologies and does not create a need for any change in our assumptions 
in late  one commonly referenced benchmark increased its estimate of ultimate industry asbestos losses from billion to billion 
little reasoning was given to explain the increase other than the fact that the industry has reported ultimate losses of billion as of year end  and that the industry has been increasing its estimate of ultimate losses by approximately billion per year over recent years 
based on the lack of reasoning presented  it is unclear to what extent the phenomena of asbestos losses presenting as non products has influenced the most recent increase 
it should be noted that our experience in recent years on its portfolio of asbestos exposures has not mirrored that of the industry 
over recent years  our ultimate loss estimates for asbestos have consistently decreased as a result of favourable commutation and policy buyback activity and a trend of favorable actual versus expected incurred loss emergence 
accordingly  we do not believe our recent loss development experience on our portfolio of asbestos exposures supports an increase to our loss reserve levels at this time 
one key measure of reserve strength for asbestos reserves is the three year average paid survival ratio 
this measure compares the asbestos carried reserve amount with the average of the most recent three calendar years of asbestos loss payment activity 
the most recent available information indicates that the insurance industry s 
table of contents asbestos reserve survival ratio at year end is using an ultimate loss estimate of billion as opposed to billion based on industry reserves carried at year end produces a survival ratio of our carried reserve survival ratio at year end is it should be noted that this is consistent with the industry three year survival ratio when lagged by years 
in summary  estimates of ultimate asbestos losses for the insurance industry have increased in recent years  however  our recent history of favorable settlements on commutations and policy buybacks and of lower incurred loss emergence relative to expectations does not support an increase to our asbestos loss reserve levels 
finally  our carried reserve level compares favorably with the industry carried reserve level even under an billion ultimate loss scenario using the well accepted three year average paid survival ratio 
as the basis for our environmental reserving  we had  for a number of years and based on advice supplied by our independent consulting actuaries  selected an estimate of billion ultimate industry environmental losses 
based on the most recent information available  industry reported incurred losses have now exceeded billion 
in addition  a notable industry publication has recently published a revised estimate of ultimate industry environmental losses of billion 
in light of these facts  in  we increased our estimate of ultimate environmental industry losses from billion to billion as the basis for our environmental loss reserving 
this change of assumption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to experience only moderate incurred loss development on our own portfolios of environmental exposures  and believe our carried reserve level for environmental exposures is appropriate based on the analysis conducted by both our internal and our external independent actuaries 
our current estimate of the time lag that relates to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries compared to the industry is considered reasonable given the analysis performed by our internal and external actuaries to date 
over time  additional information regarding such exposure characteristics may be developed for any given portfolio 
this additional information could cause a shift in the lag assumed 
all other non latent reserves for our all other non latent loss exposure  a range of traditional loss development extrapolation techniques is applied by our independent actuaries and us 
these methods assume that cohorts  or groups  of losses from similar exposures will increase over time in a predictable manner 
historical paid  incurred  and outstanding loss development experience is examined for earlier years to make inferences about how later years losses will develop 
the application and consideration of multiple methods is consistent with the actuarial standards of practice 
when determining which loss development extrapolation methods to apply to each company and each class of exposure within each company  we and our independent actuaries consider the nature of the exposure for each specific subsidiary and reserving segment and the available loss development data  as well as the limitations of that data 
in cases where company specific loss development information is not available or reliable  we and our independent actuaries select methods that do not rely on historical data such as incremental or run off methods and consider industry loss development information published by industry sources such as the reinsurance association of america 
in determining which methods to apply  we and our independent actuaries also consider cause of loss coding information when available 
a brief summary of the methods that are considered most frequently in analyzing non latent exposures is provided below 
this summary discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each method  as well as the data requirements for each method  all of which are considered when selecting which methods to apply for each reserve segment 
cumulative reported and paid loss development methods 
the cumulative reported case incurred loss development method relies on the assumption that  at any given state of maturity  ultimate losses can be 
table of contents predicted by multiplying cumulative reported losses paid losses plus case reserves by a cumulative development factor 
the validity of the results of this method depends on the stability of claim reporting and settlement rates  as well as the consistency of case reserve levels 
case reserves do not have to be adequately stated for this method to be effective  they only need to have a fairly consistent level of adequacy at all stages of maturity 
historical age to age loss development factors or ldfs are calculated to measure the relative development of an accident year from one maturity point to the next 
age to age ldfs are then selected based on these historical factors 
the selected age to age ldfs are used to project the ultimate losses 
the cumulative paid loss development method is mechanically identical to the cumulative reported loss development method described above  but the paid method does not rely on case reserves or claim reporting patterns in making projections 
the validity of the results from using a cumulative loss development approach can be affected by many conditions  such as internal claim department processing changes  a shift between single and multiple payments per claim  legal changes  or variations in a company s mix of business from year to year 
typically  the most appropriate circumstances in which to apply a cumulative loss development method are those in which the exposure is mature  full loss development data is available  and the historical observed loss development is relatively stable 
incremental reported and paid loss development methods 
incremental incurred and paid analyses are performed in cases where cumulative data is not available 
the concept of the incremental loss development methods is similar to the cumulative loss development methods described above  in that the pattern of historical paid or incurred losses is used to project the remaining future development 
the difference between the cumulative and incremental methods is that the incremental methods rely on only incremental incurred or paid loss data from a given point in time forward  and do not require full loss history 
these incremental loss development methods are therefore helpful when data limitations apply 
while this versatility in the incremental methods is a strength  the methods are sensitive to fluctuations in loss development  so care must be taken in applying them 
ibnr to case outstanding method 
this method requires the estimation of consistent cumulative paid and reported case incurred loss development patterns and age to ultimate ldfs  either from data that is specific to the segment being analyzed or from applicable benchmark or industry data 
these patterns imply a specific expected relationship between ibnr  including both development on known claims bulk reserve and losses on true late reported claims  and reported case incurred losses 
the ibnr to case outstanding method can be used in a variety of situations 
it is appropriate for loss development experience that is mature and possesses a very high ratio of paid losses to reported case incurred losses 
the method also permits an evaluation of the difference in maturity between the business being reviewed and benchmark development patterns 
depending on the relationship of paid to incurred losses  an estimate of the relative maturity of the business being reviewed can be made and a subsequent estimate of ultimate losses driven by the implied ibnr to case outstanding ratio at the appropriate maturity can be made 
this method is also useful where loss development data is incomplete and only the case outstanding amounts are determined to be reliable 
this method is less reliable in situations where relative case reserve adequacy has been changing over time 
bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection reported and paid methods 
the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on reported loss data relies on the assumption that remaining unreported losses are a function of the total expected losses rather than a function of currently reported losses 
the expected losses used in this analysis are based on initial selected ultimate loss ratios by year 
the expected losses are multiplied by the unreported percentage to produce expected unreported losses 
the unreported percentage is calculated as one minus the reciprocal of the selected cumulative incurred ldfs 
finally  the expected unreported losses are added to the current reported losses to produce ultimate losses 
the calculations underlying the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on paid loss data are similar to the bornhuetter ferguson calculations based on reported losses  with the exception that paid losses and unpaid percentages replace reported losses and unreported percentages 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is most useful as an alternative to other models for immature years 
for these immature years  the amounts reported or paid may be small and unstable and therefore not predictive of future development 
therefore  future development is 
table of contents assumed to follow an expected pattern that is supported by more stable historical data or by emerging trends 
this method is also useful when changing reporting patterns or payment patterns distort historical development of losses 
similar to the loss development methods  the bornhuetter ferguson method may be applied to loss and alae on a combined or separate basis 
the bornhuetter ferguson method may not be appropriate in circumstances where the liabilities being analyzed are very mature  as it is not sensitive to the remaining amount of case reserves outstanding  or the actual development to date 
reserve run off method 
this method first projects the future values of case reserves for all underwriting years to future ages of development 
this is done by selecting a run off pattern of case reserves 
the selected case run off ratios are chosen based on the observed run off ratios at each age of development 
once the ratios have been selected  they are used to project the future values of case reserves 
a paid on reserve factor is selected in a similar way 
the ratios of the observed amounts paid during each development period to the respective case reserves at the beginning of the periods are used to estimate how much will be paid on the case reserves during each development period 
these paid on reserve factors are then applied to the case reserve amounts that were projected during the first phase of this method 
a summation of the resulting paid amounts yields an estimate of the liability 
the reserve run off method works well when the historical run off patterns are reasonably stable and when case reserves ultimately show a decreasing trend 
another strength of this method is that it only requires case reserves at a given point in time and incremental paid and incurred losses after that point  meaning that it can be applied in cases where full loss history is not available 
in cases of volatile data where there is a persistent increasing trend in case reserves  this method will fail to produce a reasonable estimate 
in several cases  reliance upon this method was limited due to this weakness 
our independent actuaries select the appropriate loss development extrapolation methods to apply to each company and each class of exposure  and then apply these methods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses 
our management  which is responsible for the final estimate of ultimate losses  reviews the calculations of our independent actuaries  considers whether the appropriate method was applied  and adjusts the estimate of ultimate losses as it deems necessary 
historically  we have not deviated from the recommendations of our independent actuaries 
paid to date losses are then deducted from the estimate of ultimate losses to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve  and reported outstanding case reserves are then deducted from estimated total loss reserves to calculate the estimated ibnr reserve 
net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities the change in our estimated total loss reserves for both latent and all other exposures compared to that of the previous period  less net losses paid during the period  is recorded as a reduction in net ultimate losses on our statement of earnings for the period 
our estimated total loss reserve at december  was determined by estimating the ultimate losses and deducting paid to date losses 
the estimated ultimate losses  for both latent and all other non latent liabilities  were determined by the amount of advised case reserves and the application of the actuarial methodologies described above to estimate ibnr reserves 
future changes in our estimates of ultimate losses are likely to have a significant impact on future operating results 
our operating objective is to commute our loss exposures and manage non commuted loss development in a disciplined manner such that future incurred loss development will be less than expected 
a combination of future commutations and better than expected incurred loss development of non commuted exposures could improve the trend of loss development and  after the application of actuarial methodologies to the improved trend  reduce the december  estimates of ultimate losses with a positive impact on our future results 
however  it is not possible to project future commutation settlements or whether incurred loss development will be better than expected  and it is possible that ultimate loss reserves could increase based on the factors discussed herein 
quarterly reserve reviews in addition to an in depth annual review  we also perform quarterly reserve reviews 
this is done by examining quarterly paid and incurred loss development to determine whether it is consistent with reserves 
table of contents established during the preceding annual reserve review and with expected development 
loss development is reviewed separately for each major exposure type eg  asbestos  environmental  etc  for each of our relevant subsidiaries  and for large wholesale commutation settlements versus routine paid and advised losses 
this process is undertaken to determine whether loss development experience during a quarter warrants any change to held reserves 
loss development is examined separately by exposure type because different exposures develop differently over time 
for example  the expected reporting and payout of losses for a given amount of asbestos reserves can be expected to take place over a different time frame and in a different quarterly pattern from the same amount of environmental reserves 
in addition  loss development is examined separately for each of our relevant subsidiaries 
companies can differ in their exposure profile due to the mix of insurance versus reinsurance  the mix of primary versus excess insurance  the underwriting years of participation and other criteria 
these differing profiles lead to different expectations for quarterly and annual loss development by company 
our quarterly paid and incurred loss development is often driven by large  wholesale settlements such as commutations and policy buy backs which settle many individual claims in a single transaction 
this allows for monitoring of the potential profitability of large settlements  which  in turn  can provide information about the adequacy of reserves on remaining exposures that have not yet been settled 
for example  if it were found that large settlements were consistently leading to large negative  or favorable  incurred losses upon settlement  it might be an indication that reserves on remaining exposures are redundant 
conversely  if it were found that large settlements were consistently leading to large positive  or adverse  incurred losses upon settlement  it might be an indication particularly if the size of the losses were increasing that certain loss reserves on remaining exposures are deficient 
moreover  removing the loss development resulting from large settlements allows for a review of loss development related only to those contracts that remain exposed to losses 
were this not done  it is possible that savings on large wholesale settlements could mask significant underlying development on remaining exposures 
once the data has been analyzed as described above  an in depth review is performed on classes of exposure with significant loss development 
discussions are held with appropriate personnel  including individual company managers  claims handlers and attorneys  to better understand the causes 
if it were determined that development differs significantly from expectations  reserves would be adjusted 
quarterly loss development is expected to be fairly erratic for the types of exposure insured and reinsured by us 
several quarters of low incurred loss development can be followed by spikes of relatively large incurred losses 
this is characteristic of latent claims and other insurance losses that are reported and settled many years after the inception of the policy 
given the high degree of statistical uncertainty  and potential volatility  it would be unusual to adjust reserves on the basis of one  or even several  quarters of loss development activity 
as a result  unless the incurred loss activity in any one quarter is of such significance that management is able to quantify the impact on the ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses  reductions or increases in loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are carried out in the fourth quarter based on the annual reserve review described above 
as described above  our management regularly reviews and updates reserve estimates using the most current information available and employing various actuarial methods 
adjustments resulting from changes in our estimates are recorded in the period when such adjustments are determined 
the ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses is likely to differ from the original estimate due to a number of factors  primarily consisting of the overall claims activity occurring during any period  including the completion of commutations of assumed liabilities and ceded reinsurance receivables  policy buy backs and general incurred claims activity 

table of contents provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities are estimated by management by determining the future annual costs to be incurred by us  comprising staff costs  consultancy and professional fees and overheads  in managing the run off of claims liabilities for each of our insurance and reinsurance entities and is increased with outstanding losses and loss expenses 
the provision is reviewed quarterly and adjusted in accordance with the related costs incurred each period 
reinsurance balances recoverable our acquired reinsurance subsidiaries  prior to acquisition by us  used retrocessional agreements to reduce their exposure to the risk of insurance and reinsurance they assumed 
loss reserves represent total gross losses  and reinsurance receivables represent anticipated recoveries of a portion of those unpaid losses as well as amounts receivable from reinsurers with respect to claims that have already been paid 
while reinsurance arrangements are designed to limit losses and to permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses  reinsurance does not relieve us of our liabilities to our insureds or reinsureds 
therefore  we evaluate and monitor concentration of credit risk among our reinsurers  including companies that are insolvent  in run off or facing financial difficulties 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable  the reinsurance recoverable is first allocated to applicable reinsurers 
as part of this process  ceded ibnr is allocated by reinsurer 
we use a detailed analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance 
the primary components of the analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer and bad debt provisions applied to these balances to determine the portion of a reinsurer s balance deemed to be uncollectible 
these provisions require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer in order to determine its ability to settle the reinsurance balances as well as other key considerations and assumptions  such as claims and coverage issues 
valuation of investments we invest in a trading portfolio of fixed maturity investments and equities and an available for sale portfolio of fixed maturity investments 
we record both the trading and available for sale portfolios at fair value on our balance sheet 
for our trading portfolio  the unrealized gain or loss associated with the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of the investments is recorded in net earnings 
for our available for sale portfolio  the unrealized gain or loss other than credit losses is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
our other investments comprise investments in various private equity  fixed income  fixed income hedge  equity and real estate debt funds  all of which are recorded at fair value 
we measure fair value in accordance with accounting standards codification or asc  fair value measurements 
the guidance dictates a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level model derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 

table of contents when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
thus  a level fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable level and and unobservable level 
the use of valuation techniques may require a significant amount of judgment 
during periods of market disruption  including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable 
fixed maturity investments fixed maturity investments are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in interest rates  changes in issuer specific circumstances such as credit rating and changes in industry specific circumstances such as movements in credit spreads based on the market s perception of industry risks 
as a result of these potential fluctuations  it is possible to have significant unrealized gains or losses on a security 
at maturity  absent any credit loss  fixed maturity investments amortized cost will equal their fair value and no realized gain or loss will be recognized in income 
if  due to an unforeseen change in loss payment patterns  we need to sell any available for sale investments before maturity  we could realize significant gains or losses in any period  which could result in a meaningful effect on reported net income for such period 
we perform regular reviews of our available for sale fixed maturities portfolios and utilize a process that considers numerous indicators in order to identify investments that are showing signs of potential other than temporary impairment losses 
these indicators include the length of time and extent of the unrealized loss  any specific adverse conditions  historic and implied volatility of the security  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest payments  significant rating changes and recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
the consideration of these indicators and the estimation of credit losses involve significant management judgment 
any other than temporary impairment loss  or otti  related to a credit loss would be recognized in earnings  and the amount of the otti related to other factors eg interest rates  market conditions  etc 
is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
if no credit loss exists but either we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity investment or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity investment before its anticipated recovery  then the entire unrealized loss is recognized in earnings 
for the years ended december   and  we did not recognize any other than temporary impairment charges through earnings 
our fixed maturity portfolio is managed by our chief investment officer and outside investment advisors with oversight from our investment committee 
fair value prices for all investments in the fixed maturity portfolios are independently provided by the investment custodian  investment accounting service provider and investment managers  each of which utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services 
interactive data corporation is  however  the main pricing service utilized to estimate the fair value measurements for our fixed maturity investments 
we record the unadjusted price provided by the investment custodian  investment accounting service provider or the investment manager and validate this price through a process that includes  but is not limited to i comparison of prices against alternative pricing sources  ii quantitative analysis eg comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark  iii evaluation of methodologies used by external parties to estimate fair value  including a review of the inputs used for pricing  and iv comparing the price to our knowledge of the current investment market 
our internal price validation procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service 
the independent pricing services used by the investment custodian  investment accounting service provider and investment managers obtain actual transaction prices for investments that have quoted prices in active 
table of contents markets 
for determining the fair value of investments that are not actively traded  in general  pricing services use matrix pricing in which the independent pricing service uses observable market inputs including  but not limited to  reported trades  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates and such other inputs as are available from market sources to determine a reasonable fair value 
in addition  pricing services use valuation models  using observable data  such as an option adjusted spread model  to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the option adjusted spread model is commonly used to estimate fair value for investments such as mortgage backed and asset backed investments 
other investments our other investments are comprised of private equity  fixed income  fixed income hedge  equity and real estate debt funds 
investments in the funds are carried at their net asset values  which approximate fair value 
we believe the reported net asset value represents the fair value market participants would apply to an interest in the fund 
the fund managers value their underlying investments at fair value in accordance with policies established by each fund  as described in each of their financial statements and offering memoranda 
the change in fair value is included in net realized and unrealized gains on investments and recognized in net earnings 
these investments are stated at fair value  which ordinarily will be the most recently reported net asset value as advised by the fund manager or administrator 
we have ongoing due diligence processes with respect to funds in which we invest and their managers 
these processes are designed to assist us in assessing the quality of information provided by  or on behalf of  each fund and in determining whether such information continues to be reliable or whether further review is warranted 
certain funds do not provide full transparency of their underlying holdings  however  we obtain the audited financial statements for funds annually  and regularly review and discuss the fund performance with the fund managers to corroborate the reasonableness of the reported net asset values 
the use of net asset value as an estimate of the fair value for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value is a permitted practical expedient 
while reported net asset value is the primary input to the review  when the net asset value is deemed not to be indicative of fair value  we may incorporate adjustments to the reported net asset value and not use the permitted practical expedient on an investment by investment basis 
these adjustments may involve significant management judgment 
for our investments in private equity funds  we measure fair value by obtaining the most recently provided capital statement from the external fund manager or third party administrator 
the funds calculate net asset value on a fair value basis 
due to a lag in the valuations reported by the managers  we record changes in the investment value with up to a three month lag 
for all publicly traded companies within these funds  we adjust the reported net asset value based on the latest share price as of our reporting date 
we have classified our investments in private equity funds as level investments because they reflect our own judgment about the assumptions that market participants might use 
the fixed income funds and equity fund in which we invest have been classified as level investments because their fair value is estimated using the net asset value provided regularly and because the fixed income funds and equity fund are highly liquid 
for our investments in fixed income hedge funds  we measure fair value by obtaining the most recently published net asset value as advised by the external fund manager or third party administrator 
the investments in the funds are classified as level the real estate debt fund in which we invest has been classified as a level investment because its fair value is estimated using the most recent published net asset value 
our remaining other investments are valued based on the latest available capital statements and have been classified as level 
table of contents certain funds included in other investments are subject to a lock up period 
a lock up period refers to the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to invest before having the ability to redeem the investment 
funds that do provide for periodic redemptions may  depending on the funds governing documents  have the ability to deny or delay a redemption request  which is called a gate 
the fund may restrict redemptions because the aggregate amount of redemption requests as of a particular date exceeds a specified level 
the gate is a method for executing an orderly redemption process that allows for redemption requests to be executed in a timely manner to reduce the possibility of adversely affecting the remaining investors in the fund 
typically  the imposition of a gate delays a portion of the requested redemption  with the remaining portion to be settled in cash sometime after the redemption date 
certain funds included in other investments may be allowed to invest a portion of their assets in illiquid securities  such as private equity or convertible debt 
in such cases  a common mechanism used is a side pocket  whereby the illiquid security is assigned to a separate memorandum capital account or designated account 
typically  the investor loses its redemption rights in the designated account 
only when the illiquid security is sold  or is otherwise deemed liquid by the fund  may investors redeem their interest in the side pocket 
as at december   none of our funds included in other investments were subject to gates or had side pockets 
a review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis 
changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets and liabilities

comparison of years ended december  and we reported consolidated net earnings  before net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest  of approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in earnings of approximately million was attributable primarily to the following i an increase in net realized and unrealized gains of million due primarily to a mark to market changes in the market value of our equity securities  b increases in realized gains on our fixed maturities  and c increased returns from our other investments  ii a decrease in general and administrative expenses of million due principally to decreased legal fees and settlement costs related to certain litigation settled in  and iii an increase in net investment income of million primarily as a result of higher average cash and fixed maturities balances for as a result of the clarendon national insurance company acquisition  which was partially offset by a decrease in yields due to declining yields in the global fixed maturities markets  partially offset by iv a lower net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities of million  v an increase in income taxes of million due to increased tax liabilities recorded on the results of our taxable subsidiaries  vi a gain on bargain purchase of million in  which arose in relation to our acquisition of laguna life limited as compared to no gain on bargain purchase in  vii an increase in salaries and benefits costs of million due primarily to an increase in salary costs for our us operations along with an increase in our discretionary bonus plan as a result of an increase in net earnings for the year  and viii a decrease in consulting fee income of million due to lower revenue from incentive based fee arrangements 
noncontrolling interest in earnings decreased by million to million primarily as a result of lower earnings in those companies in which there are noncontrolling interests 
net earnings attributable to enstar group limited increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  comparison of years ended december  and we reported consolidated net earnings  before net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest  of approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in earnings of approximately million was attributable primarily to the following i a decrease in net investment income of million primarily as a result of a decrease  in  in net investment income due primarily to lower yields earned on our fixed maturity investments  
table of contents ii a decrease in net realized and unrealized gains of million due primarily to a decrease in our realized and unrealized gains on our other investments along with a decrease in net realized gains on our fixed maturities and equities as a result of conditions in the us equity markets  iii a lower net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities of million  iv a decrease in consulting fee income of million due to lower revenue from incentive based fee arrangements  v an increase in salaries and benefits costs of million due primarily to our increased overall headcount from at december  to at december   which was offset by a reduction in salary costs related to our discretionary bonus plan as a result of decreased net earnings for the year  vi an increase in general and administrative expenses of million due primarily to an increase in loan structure fees and letter of credit fees that were paid in  along with an overall increase in other professional fees due primarily to legal fees and settlement costs associated with certain litigation  and vii a decrease of million in our share of net earnings of our equity method investee  partially offset by viii a gain on bargain purchase of million in  which arose in relation to our acquisition of laguna life limited  ix a decrease in income taxes of million due to decreased tax liabilities recorded on the results of our taxable subsidiaries and an additional tax liability of million provided for in arising in our australian subsidiary from the formation of an australian tax consolidated group that did not recur in  and x a decrease in interest expense of million due primarily to lower interest rates on the loan facilities outstanding during we recorded noncontrolling interest in earnings of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the decrease in consulting fees of million related to the decrease in management fees earned from incentive based engagements 
consulting fee income as a percentage of net earnings has declined in recent periods  and we would expect it to remain at or around current levels in future periods  excluding the impact of any one time incentive based fees that we might receive 
while we intend to continue to provide management and consultancy services  claims inspection services and reinsurance collection services to third party clients in limited circumstances  our core focus continues to be acquiring and managing insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of business in run off

net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains years ended december  net investment income net realized and unrealized gains variance variance variance variance in thousands of us dollars total comparison of years ended december  and net investment income for the year ended december  increased by million to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of higher than average cash and fixed maturities for as a result of the acquisition of clarendon national insurance company  or clarendon 
in  we had a full year of net investment income from clarendon as opposed to net investment income for approximately six months in from the date of acquisition 
lower absolute yields obtained on cash and fixed maturities due to declining yields in global fixed maturities markets offset part of this increase 
net realized and unrealized gains for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to a combination of the following i an increase of million in net realized gains on our fixed maturities and short term investments mostly due to increased trading in those asset classes  ii an increase of million in unrealized gains on trading securities as a result of increases in the value of our investments in equities and fixed maturities in line with increases in the global markets  and iii an increase of million in returns from other investments due to increases in global equity and fixed income markets  combined with greater amounts invested in those asset classes in the average annualized return on the cash and fixed maturities inclusive of net realized and unrealized gains  but excluding net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains related to our other investments and equities for the year ended december  was as compared to the average return of for the year ended december  the average credit rating of our fixed maturities at december  and december  was aa

table of contents ii a decrease of million in our income from other investments  iii a decrease of million in our other income  and iv an increase of million in our investment expenses due to the hiring of additional third party investment managers in the average annualized return on the cash and fixed maturities inclusive of net realized and unrealized gains  but excluding net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains related to our other investments and equities for the year ended december  was as compared to the average return of for the year ended december  the average annualized return on our other investments inclusive of net realized and unrealized gains for the year ended december  was as compared to the average return of for the year ended december  net realized and unrealized gains for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a combination of the following i a decrease of million in realized and unrealized gains on our other investments  largely related to net losses recorded on our private equity investments in whereas net gains were recorded in ii a decrease of million in net realized gains on our fixed maturities and equities mostly related to lower realized gains from our equities as a result of conditions in the us equity markets  and iii a decrease of million in the change of net unrealized gains on our fixed maturities and equities as a result of the lower performance of the global markets in versus the average credit rating of our fixed maturities at december  was aa aa 
during  the rating agency standard poors downgraded the us sovereign debt from aaa to aa 
this  combined with the assets we acquired upon the acquisition of clarendon  which had a lower proportion of investments with aaa credit ratings  has resulted in us having a lower percentage of aaa rated investments than we had as at december  gain on bargain purchase years ended december  variance variance in thousands of us dollars total gain on bargain purchase of million was recorded for the year ended december  the gain on bargain purchase was earned in connection with our acquisition of laguna life limited  or laguna  and represents the excess of the cumulative fair value of net assets acquired of million over the cost of million 
this excess was  in accordance with the provisions of the business combinations topic of the fasb asc  recognized as income for the year ended december  the gain on bargain purchase arose mainly as a result of our reassessment  upon acquisition  of the total required estimated costs to manage the business to expiry 
our assessment of costs was lower than the acquired costs recorded by the vendor in the financial statements of laguna 

table of contents net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities the following table shows the components of the movement in the net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities for the years ended december   and years ended december  variance variance in thousands of us dollars net losses paid net reduction in case and lae reserves net reduction in ibnr reserves reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses reduction in provisions for bad debt reduction in provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities amortization of fair value adjustments net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities net reduction in case and lae reserves comprises the movement during the year in specific case reserve liabilities as a result of claims settlements or changes advised to us by our policyholders and attorneys  less changes in case reserves recoverable advised by us to our reinsurers as a result of the settlement or movement of assumed claims 
net reduction in ibnr reserves represents the change in our actuarial estimates of losses incurred but not reported  less amounts recoverable 
comparison of years ended december  and the net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities for the year ended december  of million was attributable to a reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses of million  a reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debt of million and a reduction in estimates of unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities of million  relating to run off activity  partially offset by the amortization  over the estimated payout period  of fair value adjustments relating to companies acquired amounting to million 
the reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses of million comprised net incurred loss development of million and reductions in net ibnr reserves of million 
during the three months ended december   one of our insurance entities  following an exposure based review of all advised claims  allocated million of net ibnr reserves to specific net case and lae reserves 
excluding this allocation  net incurred loss development for the year ended december  was a favorable million and reductions in net ibnr reserves amounted to million 
the decrease in the aggregate estimate of net ibnr reserves of million  excluding the allocation of million from net ibnr reserves to specific net case and lae reserves compared to million during the year ended december   was comprised of million relating to asbestos liabilities compared to million in  million relating to environmental liabilities compared to million in  million relating to general casualty liabilities compared to million in and million relating to all other remaining liabilities compared to million in 

table of contents the aggregate reduction in net ibnr reserves of million was a result of the application  on a basis consistent with the assumptions applied in the prior period  of our actuarial methodologies to revised historical loss development data  following commutations  to estimate loss reserves required to cover liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to non commuted exposures 
the prior period estimate of aggregate net ibnr reserves was reduced as a result of the combined impact on all classes of business of loss development activity during  including commutations and the favorable trend of loss development related to non commuted policies compared to prior forecasts 
the net incurred favorable loss development  excluding the allocation of million from net ibnr reserves to specific net case and lae reserves  of million  resulting from settlement of net advised case and lae reserves of million for net paid losses of million  related to the settlement of non commuted losses in the year and commutations of assumed and ceded exposures 
net incurred liabilities settled by way of commutation during the year ended december  amounted to million comprising million of assumed incurred liabilities partially offset by million of ceded incurred reinsurance recoverables compared to the net aggregate reduction in advised case reserves during the same period of million excluding the allocation of million from net ibnr reserves to specific net case and lae reserves 
commutations provide an opportunity for us to exit exposures to entire policies with insureds and reinsureds at a discount to the previous estimated ultimate liability 
as a result of exiting all exposures to such policies  all advised case reserves and net ibnr reserves relating to that insured or reinsured are eliminated 
this often results in a net gain irrespective of whether the settlement exceeds the advised case reserves 
we adopt a disciplined approach to the review and settlement of non commuted claims through claims adjusting and the inspection of underlying policyholder records such that settlements of assumed exposures may often be achieved below the level of the originally advised loss  and settlements of ceded receivables may often be achieved at levels above carried balances 
of the commutations completed  three related to our top ten insured and or reinsured exposures  and one related to our top ten ceded reinsurance assets  all four of which commutations were completed in the three months ended june  the remaining commutations  of which approximately were completed during the three months ended december   were of a smaller size  consistent with our approach of targeting significant numbers of cedant and reinsurer relationships  as well as targeting significant individual cedant and reinsurer relationships 
the combination of the claims settlement activity in  including commutations  and the actuarial estimation of net ibnr reserves required for the remaining non commuted exposures which took into account the favorable trend of loss development in related to such exposures compared to prior forecasts  resulted in our management concluding that the loss development activity that occurred subsequent to the prior reporting period provided sufficient new information to warrant a reduction in net ibnr reserves of million excluding the allocation of million from net ibnr reserves to specific net case and lae reserves in the reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debt of million was a result of the collection of certain reinsurance recoverables against which bad debt provisions had been provided in earlier periods

the prior period estimate of aggregate net ibnr reserves was reduced as a result of the combined impact on all classes of business of loss development activity during  including commutations and the favorable trend of loss development related to non commuted policies compared to prior forecasts 
the lower reduction in asbestos ibnr reserves during was primarily due to reduced commutations of asbestos related exposures compared to the prior year 
total net loss reserves acquired from january  to december  amounted to  million  of which  million  or  related to all other losses 
this increase in all other loss reserves provided the basis for a greater reduction in all other ibnr reserves 
the net incurred favorable loss development of million  resulting from settlement of net advised case and lae reserves of million for net paid losses of million  related to the settlement of non commuted losses in the year and approximately commutations of assumed and ceded exposures  excluding the three commutations completed subsequent to december  net incurred liabilities settled by way of commutation during the year ended december  excluding the three commutations completed subsequent to december  amounted to million compared to the net reduction in advised case reserves during the same period of million 
of the commutations completed during  nine related to our top ten insured and or reinsured exposures and two related to our top ten ceded reinsurance assets  including three commutations completed shortly after december  whereby the related reduction in net ibnr reserves was recorded in the reduction in net ultimate losses for the year 
the remaining commutations  of which approximately were completed during the three months ended december   were of a smaller size  consistent with our approach of targeting significant numbers of cedant and reinsurer relationships  as well as targeting significant individual cedant and reinsurer relationships 
the combination of the claims settlement activity in  including commutations  and the actuarial estimation of net ibnr reserves required for the remaining non commuted exposures which took into account the favorable trend of loss development in related to such exposures compared to prior forecasts  resulted in our management concluding that the loss development activity that occurred subsequent to the prior reporting period provided sufficient new information to warrant a reduction in net ibnr reserves of million in the reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debt of million was a result of the collection  primarily during the three months ended december   of certain reinsurance receivables against which bad debt provisions had been provided in earlier periods

the increase of million for the year ended december  was due primarily to the increase in earnings for those companies where there exists a noncontrolling interest 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our capital management strategy is to preserve sufficient capital to enable us to make future acquisitions while maintaining a conservative investment strategy 
as we are a holding company and have no substantial operations of our own  our assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries 
the potential sources of the cash flows to enstar as a holding company consist of dividends  advances and loans from our subsidiary companies 
our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries 
the ability to pay dividends and make other distributions is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate  including bermuda  the united kingdom  the united states  australia and europe  which subject these subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  certain of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital resources requirements and limit the amount of dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us  which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
for more information on these laws and regulations  see business regulation beginning on page as of december  and  all of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries capital resources levels were in excess of the minimum levels required  with the exception of one of our us insurance companies that was acquired whilst under supervision and is not in compliance with its minimum risk based capital level 
we do not believe this company s non compliance will have an impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
in addition  our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and make other forms of distributions may be further limited by repayment obligations in certain of our outstanding loan facility agreements 
we believe that restrictions on liquidity resulting from restrictions on the payments of dividends by our subsidiary companies will not have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
retained earnings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are not currently restricted as minimum capital solvency margins are covered by share capital and additional paid in capital 
our sources of funds primarily consist of the cash and investment portfolios acquired on the completion of the acquisition of an insurance or reinsurance company in run off 
these acquired cash and investment balances are classified as cash provided by investing activities 
we expect to use these funds acquired  together with collections from reinsurance debtors  consulting income  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments  to meet expected claims payments and operational expenses with the remainder used for acquisitions and additional investments 
we expect a net use of cash from operations as total net claim payments and operating expenses will generally be in excess of investment income earned 
we expect our operating cash flows  together with our existing capital base and cash and investments acquired on the acquisition of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  to be sufficient to meet cash requirements and to operate our business 
we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments of billion  compared to billion at december  our cash and cash equivalent portfolio is comprised mainly of cash  high grade fixed deposits  commercial paper with maturities of less than three months and money market funds 
reinsurance recoverables our acquired insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  prior to acquisition by us  used retrocessional agreements to reduce their exposure to the risk of reinsurance assumed 
we remain liable to the extent that retrocessionaires do not meet their obligations under these agreements  and therefore  we evaluate and monitor concentration of credit risk 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 

table of contents as of december  and  we had total reinsurance balances recoverable of billion and billion  respectively 
the decrease of million in total reinsurance balances recoverable was primarily a result of commutations  cash collections and a reduction in estimated ultimate losses in the year ended december  at december  and  the provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable relating to total reinsurance balances recoverable was million and million  respectively 
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable  the reinsurance balances recoverable are first allocated to applicable reinsurers 
as part of this process  ceded ibnr reserves are allocated by reinsurer 
the ratio of the provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable to total reinsurance balances recoverable excluding provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable as of december  increased to as compared to as of december  this was primarily as a result of commutations and the collection of reinsurance balances recoverable against which there were minimal provisions for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable 
cash flows we primarily generate our cash from the acquisitions we complete 
these acquired cash and investment balances are classified as cash provided by investing activities 
we expect the net operating cash flows for us  to expiry  to be negative as we pay out cash in claims payments and operational expenses in excess of cash generated via investment income and consulting fees
