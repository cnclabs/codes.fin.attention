during  we made payments of million and million for operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations  respectively 
we fund our defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus additional voluntary contribution amounts we deem appropriate 
estimated future funding requirements are highly dependent on factors that are not readily determinable 
these include changes in legislation  returns earned on pension investments  labor negotiations and other factors related to assumptions regarding future liabilities 
in  we made contributions of million to our domestic and international pension plans and million to our post retirement benefit plans including payments made by us directly to plan participants 
see critical accounting estimates below for details regarding current pension assumptions 
to the extent that current assumptions are not realized  actual funding requirements may be significantly different from those described below 
the following table summarizes the estimated future funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans under current assumptions funding requirements by period in millions qualified domestic pension plans a international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans a the future funding requirements for the our qualified domestic pension plans exclude estimated amounts related to the net pension liability included in liabilities of discontinued operations that

the actuarial valuation of those net pension liabilities will be updated prior to the closing of the transaction and could result in an increase or decrease in the net liability transferred and thereby the estimated future funding requirement 
on may   one of our uk subsidiaries entered into definitive agreements with the trustees of the great lakes uk limited pension plan uk pension plan over the terms of a recovery plan which provided for a series of additional cash contributions to be made to reduce the underfunding over time 
the agreements provided  among other things  for our uk subsidiary to make cash contributions of million approximately million in just over a three year period  with the initial contribution of million million made in the second quarter of and the second contribution of million million made in the second quarter of the next contribution of million million is expected to be made in the second quarter of the agreements also provided for the granting of both a security interest and a guarantee to support certain of the liabilities under the uk pension plan 
there is also an evaluation being undertaken as to whether additional benefit obligations exist in connection with the equalization of certain benefits under the uk pension plan that occurred in the early s 
based on the results of the evaluation to date  million of expense was recorded in the fourth quarter of  which may be subject to adjustment as further information is gathered as part of the evaluation 
upon completion of the evaluation and the finalization of the liability with respect to additional benefit obligations  additional cash contributions to the uk pension plan may be required starting in there were no changes to the evaluation during we have substantial us net operating losses nols as described in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
while our utilization of these nols is subject to annual federal nol limitations under internal revenue code irc section  we expect they will substantially reduce the amount of us cash tax payments we are required to make in the foreseeable future 
other sources and uses of cash we expect to finance our continuing operations and capital spending requirements for with cash flows provided by operating activities  available cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our abl facility and term loan  the antioxidant sale and other sources 
cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations as of december  were million  of which million was held by chemtura and our us subsidiaries and million was held by our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures 
the cash and cash equivalents of our foreign subsidiaries are used to fund seasonal working capital requirements  make cash contributions to various pension plans  fund capital expenditures  and make cash contributions to our foreign joint ventures  as warranted 
in light of these cash requirements  we consider undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations 
as a result of our emergence from chapter bankruptcy protection in  and the associated significant reduction in debt that occurred  we have determined that we will no longer need to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to fund our us operations 
as of december   such undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries totaled million 
repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to adverse tax consequences given the potentially higher us effective tax rates and withholding tax requirements in the source country 
estimating the range of tax liabilities that could arise from the repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is not practicable at this time 

table of contents strategic initiatives we continually review each of our businesses  individually and as part of our portfolio to determine whether to continue in  consolidate  reorganize  exit or expand our businesses  operations and product lines 
in each case  we examine whether  on a short term or long term basis  the business  operation or product line constitutes a strategic fit with our products  contributed to our financial health and will achieve our business objectives 
if it does not  we will implement initiatives which may include  among other things  limiting or exiting the business  operation or product line  consolidating operations or facilities or selling or otherwise disposing of the business or asset 
our review process also involves expanding businesses  investing in innovation and regional growth  expanding existing product lines and bringing new products to market or changing the way do business

we incurred substantial expenses resulting from our chapter cases 
such amounts are presented as reorganization items  in our consolidated statements of operations and represent the direct and incremental costs related to our chapter cases such as professional fees  net  impacts related to the resolution of claims in the chapter cases and rejections or terminations of executory contracts and real property leases

the letters of credit and guarantees were primarily related to insurance obligations  environmental obligations  banking credit facilities  vendor deposits and european value added tax vat obligations 
we also had million and million of third party guarantees at december  and  respectively  for which we have reserved less than million and million at december  and  respectively  which representing the probability weighted fair value of these guarantees 
in addition  we have a financing agreement with a bank in brazil for certain customers under which we receive funds from the bank at invoice date  and in turn  the customer agrees to pay the bank on the due date 
we provide a full recourse guarantee to the bank in the event of customer non payment 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
accounting estimates and assumptions described in this section are those we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
for all of these estimates  we note that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following discussion summarizes our critical accounting estimates 
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets we have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment procedures for all of our reporting units in accordance with asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other goodwill asc as of july  or sooner  if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units utilizing income and market approaches through the application of discounted cash flow and market comparable methods level inputs as described in note financial instruments and fair value measurements 
the assessment is required to be performed in two steps step one to test for a potential impairment of goodwill and  if potential impairments are identified  step two to measure the impairment loss through a full fair value allocation of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit utilizing the acquisition method of accounting 
we continually monitor and evaluate business and competitive conditions that affect our operations and reflect the impact of these factors in our financial projections 
if permanent or sustained changes in business or competitive conditions occur  they can lead to revised projections that could potentially give rise to impairment charges 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively  to loss earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax and million and million in and  respectively  to impairment charges in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note restructuring and asset impairment activities in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we are involved in environmental matters of various types in a number of jurisdictions 
a number of such matters involve claims for material amounts of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities  including cleanup costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites and natural resource damages 
as part of the chapter cases  under the plan  the debtors retained responsibility for environmental cleanup liabilities relating to currently owned or operated sites ie sites that were part of the debtors estates and  with certain exceptions  discharged or settled liabilities relating to formerly owned or operated sites ie sites that were no longer part of the debtors estates and third party sites ie sites that never were part of the debtors estates 
each quarter  we evaluate and review estimates for future remediation  operation and management costs directly related to remediation  to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site where the cost of remediation is probable and reasonably estimable  we determine the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by us and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
at sites where we expect to incur ongoing operation and maintenance expenditures  we accrue on an undiscounted basis for a period of generally years  those costs which are probable and reasonably estimable 
as of december   our reserve for ongoing environmental remediation activities totaled million 
we estimate that ongoing environmental liabilities could range up to million at december  our ongoing reserves include estimates for determinable clean up costs 
at a number of these sites  the extent of contamination has not yet been fully investigated or the final scope of remediation is not yet determinable 
in addition  it is possible that our estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken  current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted 

table of contents we intend to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
the resolution of environmental matters asserted against us could require us to pay remedial costs or damages  which are not currently determinable  that could exceed our present estimates  and as a result could have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
pension and other post retirement benefits expense as part of our financial restructuring under chapter  on november   the bankruptcy court entered an order the opeb order approving  in part  our motion the opeb motion requesting authorization to modify certain post retirement welfare benefits the opeb benefits under our post retirement welfare benefit plans the opeb plans  including the opeb benefits of certain uniroyal salaried retirees the uniroyal salaried retirees 
in november  we reached an agreement in principle with a steering committee of the uniroyal salaried retirees resolving all disputes concerning the opeb motion and effectuating a partial grant of the relief requested in the opeb motion with respect to the uniroyal salaried retirees  which was approved by the bankruptcy court at a hearing held on march  for more information about the proposed settlement  see note pension and other post retirement plans in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our calculation of pension and other post retirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  mortality rates  expected salary and wage increases  and other relevant factors 
components of pension and other post retirement benefits expense include interest and service costs on the pension and other post retirement benefit plans  expected return on plan assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations 
actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other post retirement benefits costs and obligations 
pension plans pension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis and the assumed discount rate is a significant assumption 
at each measurement date  the discount rate is based on interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities 
at december   we utilized a discount rate of for our domestic qualified pension plan compared to at december  for the international and non qualified plans  a weighted average discount rate of was used at december   compared to used at december  as a sensitivity measure  a basis point reduction in the discount rate for all plans would result in less than a million decrease in pre tax earnings for domestic discount rates adopted at december  utilized an interest rate yield curve to determine the discount rate pursuant to guidance codified under asc topic  defined benefit plans asc 
the yield curve is comprised of aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
we discounted the annual cash flows of our domestic pension plans using this yield curve and developed a single point discount rate matching the respective plan payout structure 
a similar approach was used to determine the appropriate discount rates for the international plans 
the actual method used varies from country to country depending on the amount of available information on bond yields to be able to estimate a single point discount rate to match the respective plan benefit disbursements 

table of contents our weighted average estimated rate of compensation increase was for applicable domestic and international pension plans combined at december  as a sensitivity measure  an increase of basis points in the estimated rate of compensation increase would decrease pre tax earnings for by an immaterial amount 
the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our investment strategy  historical experience  and expectations for long term rates of return 
we determine the expected rate of return on plan assets for the domestic and international pension plans by applying the expected returns on various asset classes to our target asset allocation 
we utilized a weighted average expected long term rate of return of on all domestic plan assets and a weighted average rate of for the international plan assets for the year ended december  historical returns are evaluated based on an arithmetic average of annual returns derived from recognized passive indices  such as the s p  for the major asset classes 
we looked at the arithmetic averages of annual investment returns from passive indices  assuming a portfolio of investments that follow the current target asset allocation for the domestic plans over several business cycles  to obtain an indication of the long term historical market performance 
the arithmetic average return over the past years was  and over the past years it was 
both of these values exceeded the domestic expected return on assets for the actual annualized return on plan assets for the domestic plans for the months ended december  was approximately net of investment expenses  which was above the expected return on asset assumption for the year 
the international plans realized a weighted average return of approximately in local currency terms and approximately in us dollar terms 
changes in exchange rates resulted in currency gains of approximately million on plan assets  which were partially offset by currency losses of approximately million on benefit obligations for the international pension arrangements 
our target asset allocation for the domestic pension plans is based on investing of plan assets in equity instruments  of plan assets in fixed income investments and in all other types of investments 
at december   of the portfolio was invested in equities  in fixed income investments and in real estate and other investments 
we have unrecognized actuarial losses relating to our pension plans which have been included in our consolidated balance sheet  but not in our consolidated statements of operations 
the extent to which these unrecognized actuarial losses will impact future pre tax earnings depends on whether the unrecognized actuarial losses are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism the market related value as defined by asc topic  defined benefit plans pensions asc  or through amortization in pre tax earnings to the extent that they exceed a amortization corridor  as defined by asc  which provides for amortization over the average remaining participant career or life 
the amortization of unrecognized net losses existing as of december  will result in a million decrease to pre tax earnings for million for the qualified domestic plans and million for the international and non qualified plans 
since future gains and losses beyond are a result of various factors described herein  it is not possible to predict with certainty to what extent the combination of current and future losses may exceed the percent amortization corridor and thereby be subject to further amortization 
at the end of  unrecognized net losses amounted to million for the qualified domestic plans and million for the international and non qualified plans 
of these amounts  million of unrecognized gains for the domestic plans and million of unrecognized losses for the international plans are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism as required by asc 
table of contents the pre tax pension expense for all pension plans was million in  which included million related to loss from discontinued operations 
pension income expense is calculated based upon certain assumptions including discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and expected salary and wage increases 
actual results that differ from the current assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and will affect pension expense in future periods 
the following table estimates the future pension expense  based upon current assumptions pension expense income by year in millions qualified domestic pension plans a international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans a the future pension expense income for the our qualified domestic pension plans exclude estimated amounts related to the net pension liability included in liabilities of discontinued operations that will be transferred to addivant upon closing of the sale of our antioxidants business 
the actuarial valuation of those net pension liabilities will be updated prior to the closing of the transaction and could result in an increase or decrease in the net liability transferred and thereby the estimated future pension expense 
the following tables show the impact of a basis point change in the actual return on assets on the pension income expense

the discount rates we adopted for the valuation of the post retirement health care plans were determined using the same methodology as for the pension plans 
at december   we utilized a weighted average discount rate of for post retirement health care plans  compared to at december  as a sensitivity measure  a basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in an immaterial change in pre tax earnings for assumed health care cost trend rates are based on past and current health care cost trends  considering such factors as health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and the overall health of plan participants 
we use health care trend cost rates

the pre tax post retirement healthcare expense was million in the following table summarizes projected post retirement benefit expense based upon the various assumptions discussed above 
pre tax expense by year in millions domestic and international post retirement benefit plans income taxes income taxes payable reflect our current tax provision and management best estimate of the current tax liability relating to the outcome of uncertain tax positions 
if the actual outcome of uncertain tax positions differs from our best estimates  an adjustment to income taxes payable could be required  which may result in additional income tax expense or benefit 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
we also record deferred tax assets for the expected future tax benefits of net operating losses and income tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
thus  changes in future results of operations could result in adjustments to our valuation allowances 
we anticipate that we will repatriate the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
for the year ended december   we increased by million the amount of the net deferred tax liability we provide for the us tax consequences of these repatriations 
in  this increase has been offset by an equal reduction in the valuation allowance related to us deferred tax assets  and  as such  had no net effect on tax expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
we consider undistributed earnings of all other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations 
at december   such undistributed earnings deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations amounted to million 
repatriation of undistributed earnings  currently deemed indefinitely reinvested  would require us to accrue and pay taxes in the future 
estimating the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable at this time 
we file income tax returns in the u 
s including federal and state and foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax returns for our entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment 
we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
the economic benefit associated with a tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position ultimately will be sustained 
we adjust these liabilities  if necessary  upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 
we have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily related to settlements of tax audits in various foreign jurisdictions

outlook was a year of significant progress towards our objective of creating a focused portfolio of global specialty chemical businesses that provide sustainable competitive advantage and continued growth opportunities through superior innovation  reliability  and applied science  making chemtura indispensable to our stakeholders 
performance improvement was led by our chemtura agrosolutions segment 
with the benefit of investment in new product  registrations and distribution channels combined with cost rationalization initiatives  segment operating income more than doubled 
the segment is now approaching its former levels of performance with the ability to now surpass them 
our industrial segments faced weaker demand as progressed  but were able to offset much of the impact through the introduction of innovative new products and applications and careful margin management 
we made a major step in our portfolio management through entering into the agreement to sell our antioxidant business and captured an important source of the additional bromine we will need to serve growing customer demand through entering into the agreement to purchase solaris chemtech bromine assets in india 
in  we intend to make further progress 
we already have plans in place to promptly eliminate the stranded functional costs due to the divestiture of our antioxidant business  preserving the pre divestiture margins of our segments 
we then plan to drive margins higher by continuing to invest in innovation  bringing products with improved performance to existing customers and capturing new applications and customers 
we will sustain close attention to margin management that has expanded percentage operating margins in continuing to explore portfolio transformation opportunities will remain a priority in our chemtura agrosolutions and consumer products segments are poised to deliver year over year improvement over the strong base they built in the global agrochemical economy remains robust and we anticipate gaining additional benefits in from new product offerings and registrations and expansion into faster growing regions like latin american 
consumer products continues to introduce new products and explore different marketing strategies 
our industrial segments enter with many industrial markets still facing the weaker demand conditions they experienced in we anticipate that we will see some level of recovery build as the year progresses  particularly in the asia pacific region  however  we wait to see how such recovery may evolve 
conditions in the first quarter remain at comparable levels to the fourth quarter  giving a challenging start to the year 
the continued development and introduction of new products and applications combined with careful margin management can contribute as it did in the investments in production capacity last year for new products already commercialized will also contribute to industrial segment performance improvement 
through our portfolio improvement strategies  in chemtura will be smaller  but will improve operating margins and have a portfolio of strongly differentiated product lines based on proprietary chemical technologies  that offer superior organic revenue growth positioned to exploit secular industry growth trends in all regions of the globe

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our activities expose our earnings  cash flows and financial condition to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy prices 
we have short term exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from transactions entered into by us and our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currency primarily trade payables and receivables 
we are also exposed to currency risk on intercompany transactions including intercompany loans 
the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro  canadian dollar  british pound sterling  taiwanese dollar  japanese yen  swiss franc  brazilian real and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations 
in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 
we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts 
the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with global operating activities 
the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by these counterparties 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges  in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across carious subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures 
in the event a natural hedge is not available  we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure  generally expiring within one year 
while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying 
table of contents exposures being hedged 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
our financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of two forward currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of million  equally due in april of and these contracts limit our risk to changes in the euro over those periods and represent a net asset position of less than million at december  we conducted sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous change in the euro from its value as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a increase in the euro against the us dollar would result in an increase of million in the fair value of these contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of these contracts represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the underlying monetary exposures the portfolio is hedging 
the effect of exchange movements on those anticipated transactions would be expected to mitigate the impacts implied by our sensitivity analysis 
we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  or the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by stated maturity date for our debt 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on the applicable floating rate index as of december  interest rate sensitivity in millions and thereafter total fair value at total debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate a a average interest rate is based on rates in effect at december
