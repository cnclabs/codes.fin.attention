table of contents sources of funds general 
our sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  payment of principal and interest on loans  interest earned on or maturation of other investment securities and funds provided from operations 
deposits 
we offer a variety of deposit accounts to both consumers and businesses having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
our deposits consist of savings and checking accounts  money market deposit accounts  now accounts  demand accounts  and certificates of deposit 
we solicit deposits primarily in our market areas and rely on competitive pricing policies  marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in addition  we solicit brokered deposits when terms and rates are more favorable than those in the markets we serve 
at december   we had million in brokered deposits  of which million were one way purchases of certificate of deposit account registry service or cdars  and million were customer balances placed in the reciprocal cdars product 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates and competition 
the variety of deposit accounts we offer has allowed us to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand 
we have become more susceptible to short term fluctuations in deposit flows  as customers have become more interest rate conscious 
we try to manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset and liability management  liquidity and profitability objectives  subject to competitive factors 
based on our experience  we believe that our deposits are relatively stable sources of funds 
despite this stability  our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions 
under regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb  we are required to maintain noninterest bearing reserves at specified levels against our transaction accounts  primarily checking and now accounts 
at december   we were in compliance with these federal requirements and  as a result  would have been deemed to be in compliance with a similar reserve requirement under georgia law

although deposits are our primary source of funds  we may utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds  when we desire additional capacity to fund loan demand  or when they meet our asset liability management goals 
our borrowings consist of advances from the fhlb  federal funds purchased  and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
see item notes and note to the consolidated financial statements 
advances from the fhlb require borrowing capacity supported by the pledging of certain loans or securities 
these advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate  range of maturities  and call features 
at december   we had million in fhlb advances outstanding and the ability to borrow an additional million 
we have the ability to borrow from securities broker dealers and customers by pledging investments 
these arrangements are known as securities sold under repurchase agreements 
these borrowings can be done on an overnight  short term or long term basis 
as of december   we had million borrowed under long term agreements with broker dealers and million borrowed under overnight agreements with customers 
we also have the ability to borrow up to million from correspondent banks  pursuant to renewable lines of credit 
in addition  we also borrow from chattahoochee bank of georgia on an overnight basis  depending on their liquidity needs 
at december   we had approximately  in federal funds purchased from that bank compared with million at december  we are authorized to borrow from the federal reserve bank of atlanta discount window after we have exhausted other reasonable alternative sources of funds  including fhlb advances

how we are regulated set forth below is a brief description of material information regarding certain laws and regulations that are and will be applicable to heritage and heritagebank 
heritage is a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the frb 
the frb requires that heritage serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for heritagebank  particularly when heritagebank is in financial distress 
heritagebank is a georgia savings bank subject to regulation and supervision by the gdfb and the fdic  which also insures our deposits 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb that has authority to promulgate regulations intended to protect consumers with respect to financial products and services  including those provided by heritagebank  and to restrict unfair  deceptive or abusive conduct by providers of consumer financial products and services 
these regulations had previously been enacted by heritagebank s primary federal regulator 
as a public company  heritage is subject to the regulation and reporting requirements of the sec 
legislation is introduced from time to time in the united states congress and georgia general assembly that may affect our operations 
in addition  the regulations governing heritage and heritagebank may be amended from time to time by the gdbf  the fdic  the frb  the cfpb or the sec  as appropriate 
any legislative or regulatory changes  including those resulting from the dodd frank act  in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
this includes the authority from the dodd frank act effective july   for financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposits  which could increase our interest expense 
see the dodd frank act below for additional information on its provisions 
the gdbf  the fdic and the frb  as appropriate  have extensive enforcement authority over heritage and heritagebank

in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action  including misleading or untimely reports filed with the fdic 
except under certain circumstances  public disclosure of formal enforcement actions by the fdic and frb is required by law 

table of contents heritagebank of the south heritagebank  as a georgia savings bank  is subject to regulation and periodic examination by the gdbf and the fdic 
this regulation extends to all aspects of its operations 
heritagebank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on the payment of dividends to heritage 
see regulatory capital requirements for heritagebank and limitations on dividends and other capital distributions below 
state and federal laws and regulations prescribe the investment and lending authority and activities of georgia savings banks 
the fdic also insures the deposits of heritagebank to the maximum extent permitted by law 
this regulation of heritagebank is generally intended for the protection of depositors and the insurance of accounts fund and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders 
georgia regulation 
heritagebank is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the gdbf 
the gdbf regularly examines heritagebank  often jointly with the fdic 
as a georgia savings bank  heritagebank is required to have no more than of its assets in commercial real estate and business loans 
heritagebank is in compliance with this requirement 
our lending and investment authority and other activities are governed by georgia law and regulations and policies of the gdbf 
we are subject to a statutory lending limit for aggregate loans to one person or a group of persons combined because of certain common interests 
that limit is of our statutory capital base  except for loans fully secured by good collateral or ample security  which includes real estate with an independent appraisal  in which case that limit is increased to 
our statutory capital base consists of our stock  paid in capital and surplus  capital debt and appropriated retained earnings  which is that portion of our retained earnings designated by the board of directors as not available for dividends  reduced by intangible assets 
we have not appropriated any retained earnings 
georgia law limits our ability to invest in real estate  including a limit on fixed assets of of our statutory capital base  except for temporary grants of authority to exceed that limit granted by the gdbf 
we are in compliance with limitations on our fixed assets as of december  insurance of accounts and regulation by the fdic 
the fdic regularly examines heritagebank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any deficiencies that it may find in operations 
heritagebank generally must notify or obtain the approval of the fdic if it or any of its subsidiaries intend to engage in activities not authorized for national banks 
during examinations  the fdic may require the bank to establish additional reserves for loan losses  which decreases the company s net income 
the fdic has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation  asset quality  earnings standards  internal controls and audit systems  interest rate risk exposure  and compensation and other employee benefits 
any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan 
heritagebank s deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the fdic  and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
the basic deposit insurance is  per each separately insured depositor  as defined in fdic regulations 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by insured institutions 
our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended december  were approximately  those premiums have increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future 
also  if the bank experiences financial distress or operates in an unsafe or unsound manner  these deposit premiums will increase based on the formula established by the fdic 
on february   pursuant to the dodd frank act  the fdic adopted new regulations  which became effective april   that redefined the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments 
unlike the previous system  in which the assessment base was calculated by using an insured depository institution s domestic deposits less a few allowable exclusions  the new assessment base is calculated using the average consolidated total assets of an insured depository institution less the average tangible equity tier capital of such institution 
the fdic continues to utilize a risk based assessment system in which institutions will be subject to assessment rates ranging from to basis points  subject to adjustments for unsecured debt and  in certain cases  brokered deposits 
the new rules eliminated adjustments for secured liabilities 

table of contents the new rules retain the fdic s flexibility to  without further notice and comment rulemaking  adopt rates that are higher or lower than the stated base assessment rates  provided that the fdic cannot i increase or decrease the total rates from one quarter to the next by more than two basis points  or ii deviate by more than two basis points from the stated base assessment rates 
although the dodd frank act makes the fdic s payment of a dividend to depository institutions discretionary  as opposed to mandatory  when the reserve ratio exceeds a certain threshold  the fdic s new rule establishes a decreasing schedule of assessment rates that would take effect when the dif reserve ratio first meets or exceeds 
if the dif reserve ratio meets or exceeds  base assessment rates would range from to basis points  if the dif reserve ratio meets or exceeds  base assessment rates would range from to basis points  and if the dif reserve ratio meets or exceeds  base assessment rates would range from to basis points 
all base assessment rates would continue to be subject to adjustments for unsecured debt and brokered deposits 
the fdic also collects a deposit based assessment from insured financial institutions on behalf of the financing corporation fico 
the funds from these assessments are used to service debt issued by fico in its capacity as a financial vehicle for the federal savings loan insurance corporation 
the fico assessment rate is set quarterly and in it averaged cents per of average total assets less average tangible equity 
these assessments will continue until the debt matures between and the fdic also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity that it determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the deposit insurance fund and may terminate our deposit insurance if it determines we have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or are in an unsafe or unsound condition 
heritage as the holding company of a georgia savings bank  heritage is subject to regulation and periodic examination by the gdbf and the frb 
this regulation extends to all aspects of its operations 
our federal and state regulators impose minimum capital requirements on us and the other holding companies and financial institutions they regulate 
they also may impose higher capital requirements on an individualized basis if they believe the financial institution or holding company is subject to excessive risk 
see regulatory capital requirements for heritagebank and limitations on dividends and other capital distributions below 
heritage is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the frb 
applicable federal law and regulations limit the activities of heritage and require the approval of the frb for any acquisition or divestiture of a subsidiary  including another financial institution or holding company thereof 
the bank is required to file reports with the frb and is subject to regulation and examination by the frb  including regulations requiring that the company serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for the bank  particularly when the bank is in financial distress 
under federal law  if heritagebank fails the qualified thrift lender test  heritage must obtain the approval of the frb prior to continuing  directly or through other subsidiaries  any business activity other than those approved for multiple savings association holding companies or their subsidiaries 
in addition  within one year of such failure  heritage must register as  and will become subject to  the restrictions applicable to bank holding companies 
the qualified thrift lender test requires a savings institution to have at least of its portfolio assets  as defined by regulation  in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every months on a rolling basis 
as an alternative  the savings institution may maintain of its assets in those assets specified in section a of the internal revenue code 
under either test  such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments 
at december   heritagebank met the test 
the gdbf also has supervisory and examination authority over heritage 
under this authority  there are limits on the amount of debt that can be incurred by heritage  and heritage must file periodic reports and annual registration forms 

table of contents regulatory capital requirements for heritagebank 
heritagebank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital under regulations of the fdic and polices of the gdbf 
these regulations established two capital standards  a leverage capital requirement and a risk based capital requirement 
the fdic also may impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case by case basis based on the particular circumstances or risk profile of the institution 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation capital resources for information on the bank s compliance with these capital requirements 
the capital standards generally require tier capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  deducting most intangibles 
the fdic also requires heritagebank to have tier capital of at least of risk weighted assets and total capital of at least of risk weighted assets 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet items  will be multiplied by a risk weight  ranging from to  based on the risk inherent in the type of asset 
total capital consists of tier capital  as defined above  and tier capital  which consists of certain permanent and maturing capital instruments that do not qualify as tier capital and of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
tier capital may be used to satisfy these risk based requirements only to the extent of tier capital 
the fdic is authorized to require heritagebank to maintain an additional amount of total capital to account for concentration of credit risk  level of interest rate risk  equity investments in non financial companies and the risk of non traditional activities 
the fdic is authorized and  under certain circumstances  required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements 
the fdic is generally required to take action to restrict the activities of an undercapitalized institution  which is an institution with less than either a leverage capital ratio  a tier risked based capital ratio or an total risk based capital ratio 
any such institution must submit a capital restoration plan and until such plan is approved by the fdic may not increase its assets  acquire another institution  establish a branch or engage in any new activities  and generally may not make capital distributions 
the fdic is authorized to impose the additional restrictions 
any institution that fails to comply with its capital plan or has tier risk based or leverage capital ratios of less than or a total risk based capital ratio of less than is considered significantly undercapitalized and must be made subject to one or more additional specified actions and operating restrictions that may cover all aspects of its operations and may include a forced merger or acquisition of the institution 
an institution with tangible equity to total assets of less than is critically undercapitalized and becomes subject to further mandatory restrictions on it 
the fdic generally is authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose the restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition 
the imposition by the fdic of any of these measures on heritagebank may have a substantial adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
georgia imposes a capital requirement based on the leverage capital requirement of the fdic 
a georgia savings bank must have at least a leverage capital ratio  though the gdbf can impose a higher requirement for the specific circumstances and risks of the institution 
many banks are required to have a ratio to address these specific circumstances and risks  and any bank with a less than leverage capital ratio must submit a two year capital plan with the gdbf 

table of contents regulatory capital requirements for heritage 
heritage is required to maintain a certain level of capital under a policy of the gdbf that imposes a tier capital to total assets capital ratio of  or higher for holding companies engaged in more risky  non financial businesses 
this level is based on the capital requirement imposed on bank holding companies by the frb and is similar to the tier leverage ratio imposed on heritagebank 
if heritage fails to meet this requirement  it must file a capital plan and focus on reducing its more risky operations  and it may be subject to an enforcement action  including a capital directive 
limitations on dividends and other capital distributions the ability of the bank to pay dividends depends on its earnings and capital levels and may be limited by fdic or gdbf directives or orders 
unless it meets certain financial criteria  heritagebank must obtain the prior written approval of the gdbf before paying any dividend to heritage 
those financial criteria are having classified assets of no more than of tier capital plus an allowance for loan losses at the time of its last examination  paid no more than of last calendar year net income in dividends in the current calendar year  and a tier leverage capital ratio of at least 
georgia law prohibits heritagebank from paying a dividend if its debt to equity ratio is or more or if it is not meeting its capital requirement 
heritagebank paid million in dividends in and no dividends in as a subsidiary financial institution of a savings association holding company  any distributions of capital by heritage  including dividends and stock redemptions or repurchases  are subject to regulation by the frb 
heritage must file a notice with the frb before declaring any dividend 
the frb will consult the fdic about the appropriateness of the proposed dividend  and the frb may object to any proposed dividend 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates heritage and heritagebank are subject to the provisions of section a of the federal reserve act 
section a places limits on the amount of a bank s loans or extensions of credit to affiliates  a bank s investment in affiliates  assets a bank may purchase from affiliates  except for real and personal property exempted by the frb  loans or extensions of credit made by a bank to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates  and a bank s guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate 
the total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount  as to any one affiliate  to of a bank s capital and surplus and  as to all affiliates combined  to of a bank s capital and surplus 
in addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions  each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements 
heritagebank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid taking low quality assets 
heritage and heritagebank are also subject to the provisions of section b of the federal reserve act  which  among other things  prohibit an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
the dodd frank act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under section a and b  including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained 
heritagebank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers  directors  principal shareholders and their related interests 
these extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
effective july   an insured depository institution is prohibited from engaging in asset purchases or sales transactions with its officers  directors or principal shareholders unless on market terms and  if the transaction represents greater than of the capital and surplus of the bank  it has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors 

table of contents the dodd frank act the dodd frank act  which was enacted in july  has had a broad impact on the financial services industry 
its provisions include significant regulatory and compliance changes that are designed to improve the supervision  oversight  safety and soundness of the financial services sector 
additionally  the dodd frank act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies  including the financial stability oversight council  the frb  the office of the comptroller of the currency and the fdic 
some of the dodd frank act s most far reaching provisions  such as those regulating derivatives and proprietary trading activity and hedge funds  providing for enhanced supervision of systemically significant institutions  and phasing out tier capital treatment for trust preferred securities  apply only to institutions with over billion in assets or to business lines in which we do not engage 
certain provisions do  however  apply to or affect us  including provisions that change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from a deposit based to an asset based calculation as described in insurance of accounts and regulation by the fdic above  make permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance  repeal the federal prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits  impose new mortgage lending requirements  including minimum underwriting standards  originator compensation restrictions  consumer protections for certain types of loans  and disclosure to borrowers  apply to bank holding companies the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions  permit de novo and interstate branching  and impose new limits on affiliate transactions as described in restrictions on transactions with affiliates above 
basel iii in june  federal regulators issued proposed rules to implement the capital adequacy recommendations of the basel committee on banking supervision first proposed in december the proposed rules  known as basel iii  propose significant changes to the minimum capital levels and asset risk weights for all depository institutions and depository institution holding companies collectively  banking organizations with total consolidated assets of million or more 
among the many changes in these proposed rules  banking organizations would be required to hold higher levels of capital  a significantly higher portion of which would be required to be tier capital 
further  beginning in  the ability of banking organizations to declare and pay dividends or pay discretionary bonuses to certain executive officers would become limited should the banking organization fail to maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of tier common equity that is greater than applicable minimum capital requirements 
the proposed basel iii rules would also impose significant changes on the risk weighting of many assets  including home mortgages with high loan to value ratios  certain acquisition  development and construction loans  and certain past due assets 
finally  the proposed rules would also prevent trust preferred securities from counting as tier capital for the issuer following a ten year phase out ending in the final rule was expected to become effective on january   however  due to the volume and content of public comments received  the federal regulators announced on november  that the final rule would not be in effect on january  
table of contents federal taxation heritage and heritagebank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations  with some exceptions discussed below 
the following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to heritage or heritagebank 
heritage will file a consolidated federal income tax return with heritagebank 
accordingly  it is anticipated that any cash distributions made by heritage to its stockholders would be considered to be taxable dividends and not as a nontaxable return of capital to stockholders for federal and state tax purposes 
method of accounting 
for federal income tax purposes  heritagebank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on december for filing its federal income tax return 
minimum tax 
the internal revenue code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences  called alternative minimum taxable income 
the alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount 
net operating losses can offset no more than of alternative minimum taxable income 
certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years 
net operating loss carryforwards 
a financial institution may carryback net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding taxable years 
this provision applies to losses incurred in taxable years beginning after august  at december   heritage had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
corporate dividends received deduction 
because it files a consolidated return with its wholly owned subsidiary  heritagebank  dividends from heritagebank are not included as income to heritage 
the corporate dividends received deduction is  or in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return  depending on the level of stock ownership of the payor of the dividend 
corporations that own less than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct of dividends received or accrued on their behalf

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following are certain risk factors that could impact our business  financial results  and results of operations 
investing in our common stock involves risks  including those described below 
these risk factors should be considered by prospective and current investors in our common stock when evaluating the disclosures in this annual report on form k particularly the forward looking statements 
these risk factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
if any of the events in the following risks actually occur  or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe are immaterial do materialize  then our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks 
the united states economy has been gradually improving but unemployment is still elevated  and another economic downturn impacting our geographic market areas would adversely affect our business and financial results 
the united states experienced a severe economic recession beginning in and many of the effects of that recession are expected to continue in while economic growth has resumed recently  the rate of growth has been slow and unemployment remains at very high levels and is not expected to improve greatly in the near future 
furthermore  our primary market areas in southern georgia and northern and central florida have experienced unemployment rates higher than the national average 
loan portfolio quality has deteriorated at many financial institutions reflecting  in part  the weak us economy and high unemployment 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline 
the continuing real estate downturn also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing and increased delinquencies in construction  residential and commercial mortgage loans for many lenders 
stock prices for financial institutions and their holding companies have declined substantially  and it is significantly more difficult for those entities to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets 
continued negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the market for and value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
moreover  continued declines in the stock market in general  or in stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically  could adversely affect our stock performance 
our expansion efforts  particularly through new and acquired branches  may not be successful if we fail to manage our growth effectively 
a key component of our strategy to grow and improve profitability is to expand our branch network into communities within or adjacent to georgia  florida and alabama markets in which we currently conduct business 
in june  we acquired a branch in auburn  alabama from ab t national bank 
we intend to continue to pursue a growth strategy for our business 
operating branches outside of our original southwest georgia market and beyond our current market areas may subject us to additional risk  including the local risks related to the new market areas  management of employees from a distance  additional credit risks  logistical operational issues and management time constraints 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities  and  if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we expect to engage in selected acquisitions of financial institutions in the future  including fdic assisted transactions  branch acquisitions  or other business growth initiatives or undertakings 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities  that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities  if undertaken  will be successful 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage the costs and implementation risks associated with this strategy so that expansion of our branch network will be profitable 
in addition  if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired  that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us  which would adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we have engaged in three fdic assisted transactions with two subject to loss sharing agreements and may engage in more such transactions in the future  which could present additional risks to our financial condition and earnings 
we have engaged in three fdic assisted acquisitions with two subject to loss sharing agreements 
these acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks  even though the fdic might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks  such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution 
as is typical in the acquisition of a failed financial institution  many of the loans acquired in these acquisitions were non performing and had poor documentation  including a lack of current financial information on borrowers and of current evidence of collateral value 
in december  we acquired a failed bank in southeast georgia in an fdic assisted transaction  including million in loans 
this fdic assisted transaction did not involve a loss share agreement pursuant to which the fdic covers portions of the losses incurred or the assets acquired 
we did  however  receive a million purchase discount paid by the fdic 
these loans are carried on our books at fair value  based on an estimate of future cash flows  which we review and evaluate quarterly and  under gaap 
because of the condition and terms of these loans  the actual amount recognized by us on these assets could differ materially from this fair value  and we also anticipate incurring foreclosure and collection expenses on certain of these loans over the next five years  which will increase our non interest expense 
therefore  we may incur losses on this acquired loan portfolio 
in february  we acquired a failed bank in east georgia with million in loans  and in august  we acquired a failed bank in southeast georgia with million in loans 
in each of these transactions  we entered into a loss share agreement under which the fdic will reimburse us for of the losses on covered loans and other real estate owned 
these loss share agreements require us to follow specific servicing and reporting procedures 
failure to properly follow these procedures or other breach of the loss share agreements by us could result in the loss of the fdic reimbursement of losses on covered loans and other real estate owned  which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had an fdic loss share receivable of million associated with our loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
this receivable is periodically adjusted to reflect the present value of our expected losses related to fdic assisted acquisitions plus reimbursable expenses less recoveries 
the receivable is adjusted for improvements in cash flow by reducing the receivable through negative accretion 
conversely  if losses are greater than anticipated  the receivable would be increased 
in the current economic environment  we expect to be presented with more opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks through fdic assisted transactions 
however  these acquisitions are structured in a manner that does not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition  including preparing for integration of an acquired institution 
therefore  we may face additional risks  including the loss of customers  strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability 
moreover  even though we are inclined to participate in an fdic assisted transaction  we can offer no assurances that we would be successful in acquiring the financial institution or assets that we are seeking 
changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher than anticipated loan charge offs on assets acquired in fdic assisted transactions 
the fluctuations in national  regional and local economic conditions  including those related to local residential  commercial real estate and construction markets  may increase the level of charge offs that we make to our loan portfolio  and  consequently  reduce our net income  and may also increase the level of charge offs on the loan portfolios that we have acquired in fdic assisted acquisitions and correspondingly reduce our net income 
these fluctuations are not predictable  cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur 

table of contents although we have entered into two loss share agreements with the fdic providing a significant portion of losses related to specified loan portfolios that we acquired in connection with our two fdic assisted transactions will be borne by the fdic  we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios 
additionally  the loss share agreements have limited terms  therefore  any charge off of related losses that we experience after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursable by the fdic and will negatively impact our net income 
our business may be affected adversely by credit risk associated with residential real estate 
as of december   residential real estate  including home equity loans and lines of credit  totaled million  or  of total loans 
this type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that may significantly affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations  making loss levels difficult to predict 
the decline in residential real estate values resulting from the downturn in local housing markets has reduced the value of the real estate collateral securing the majority of our loans and has increased the risk that we would incur losses if borrowers default on their loans 
in addition  borrowers seeking to sell their homes may find that they cannot sell their properties for an amount equal to or greater than the unpaid principal balance of their loans 
continued declines in both the volume of real estate sales and sales prices  coupled with high levels of unemployment  may result in higher loan delinquencies or problem assets  a decline in demand for our products and services or a decrease in our deposits 
these potential negative events may cause us to incur losses  which would adversely affect our capital and liquidity and could damage our financial condition and business operations 
these declines may have a greater impact on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions that have more diversified loan portfolios 
we are subject to credit risks in connection with the concentration of adjustable rate loans in our portfolio 
adjustable rate loans totaled million  or  of our loan portfolio at december  borrowers with adjustable rate loans are exposed to increased monthly payments when the related interest rate adjusts upward under the terms of the loan to the rate computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin 
any rise in prevailing market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable rate loans  increasing the possibility of default 
borrowers seeking to avoid these increased monthly payments by refinancing their loans may no longer be able to find available replacement loans at comparably lower interest rates 
in addition  declining housing prices may prevent refinancing or a sale of the home because borrowers may then have insufficient equity in their homes 
these events  alone or in combination  may contribute to higher delinquency rates and negatively impact our earnings 
if our nonperforming assets increase  our earnings will be negatively impacted 
at december   our nonperforming assets which consist of non accrual loans  loans days or more delinquent  nonperforming troubled debt restructurings and foreclosed real estate assets totaled million  which was an increase of million or over nonperforming assets at december  our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways 
we do not record interest income on non accrual loans or real estate owned 
we must reserve for estimated credit losses  which are established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses  and from time to time  if appropriate  we must write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values 
additionally  there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs including taxes  insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned 
further  the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management  potentially distracting them from the overall supervision of our operations and other income producing activities 

table of contents if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios  new loan products  and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses  resulting in additions to our allowance 
additions to our allowance decrease our net income 
our allowance for loan losses  excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted acquisitions  was of gross loans  excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted acquisitions  and of non performing loans at december   compared to of gross loans  excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted acquisitions  and of nonperforming loans at december  our emphasis on originating commercial and residential real estate and commercial and industrial loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating the allowance for loan losses 
as we continue to increase our originations of these loans  increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary  resulting in decreased earnings 
our regulators and external auditor periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their review 
these increases in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if our investments in real estate are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses  or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves  our earnings could be reduced 
we obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as other real estate owned oreo  and at certain other times during the asset s holding period 
our net book value nbv in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs fair value 
a charge off is recorded for any excess in the asset s nbv over its fair value 
if our valuation process is incorrect  the fair value of our investments in real estate may not be sufficient to recover our nbv in such assets  resulting in the need for additional charge offs 
additional material charge offs to our investments in real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our bank regulator periodically reviews our reo and may require us to recognize further charge offs 
any increase in our charge offs  as required by our regulator  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates  which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
our securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value  potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and or earnings 
fluctuations in market value may be caused by decreases in interest rates  lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand 
our securities portfolio is evaluated for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis 
if this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities  a potential loss to earnings may occur 
changes in interest rates can have an adverse effect on our financial condition  as our available for sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value  and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
we increase or decrease our stockholders equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available for sale securities  net of taxes 
at december   the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale was million compared to a net unrealized gain of million at december  changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected significantly by changes in interest rates 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
because interest bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income 

table of contents changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
also  increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed rate assets  which would limit the funds we have available to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives  and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher interest rates 
changes in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest earning securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates 
at december   the fair value of our portfolio of available for sale securities totaled million 
gross unrealized gains on these securities totaled million  while gross unrealized losses on these securities totaled  resulting in a net unrealized gain of million at december  at december   the company s internal simulation model indicated that our net portfolio value would decrease by if there was an instantaneous parallel basis point increase in market interest rates 
see the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset and liability management and market risk 
our strategies to modify our interest rate risk profile may be difficult to implement 
our asset liability management strategies are designed to decrease our interest rate risk sensitivity 
one such strategy is increasing the amount of adjustable rate and or short term assets 
we offer adjustable rate loan products as a means to achieve this strategy 
the availability of lower rates on fixed rate loans would generally create a decrease in borrower demand for adjustable rate assets 
additionally  these adjustable rate assets may prepay 
at december   of our loan portfolio consisted of adjustable rate loans  compared to at december  we also are managing our liabilities to moderate our interest rate risk sensitivity 
customer demand is primarily for short term certificates of deposit 
using short term liabilities to fund long term  fixed rate assets will increase the interest rate sensitivity of any financial institution 
we are utilizing fhlb advances and repurchase agreements to mitigate the impact of customer demand by lengthening the maturities of these advances or entering into longer term repurchase agreements  depending on liquidity or investment opportunities 
fhlb advances and repurchase agreements are entered into as liquidity is needed or to fund assets that provide for a spread considered sufficient by management 
if we are unable to originate adjustable rate assets at favorable rates or fund loan originations or securities purchases with long term advances or structured borrowings  we may have difficulty executing this asset liability management strategy and or it may result in a reduction in profitability 
we face risks related to covenants in our loan sales to investors and secondary mortgage market conditions 
our agreements with investors to sell our loans generally contain covenants that require us to repurchase loans under certain circumstances  including some delinquencies  or to return premiums paid by those investors if the loans are paid off early 
if we are required to repurchase sold loans under these covenants  they may be deemed troubled loans  with the potential for charge offs and or loss provision changes  which could impact our earnings and asset quality ratios adversely 
we did not incur any losses in conjunction with these agreements in our ability to sell loans on the secondary mortgage market is impacted by interest rate changes and investor demand or expected return 
if this market becomes less liquid  we may not be able to rely as much on loan sales to reduce our interest rate and credit risk 
we face significant operational risks 
we operate in many different financial service businesses and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a significant number of transactions 
operational risk is the risk of loss from operations  including fraud by employees or outside persons  employees execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions  data processing and technology errors or hacking and breaches of internal control systems 

table of contents a tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
a tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may affect asset growth  our earnings capability and capital levels negatively 
we rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands 
our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts  including brokered deposits  as well as cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio 
the expiration of unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts on december  may result in a run off in such accounts to the extent that such accounts contain in excess of the  per depositor insurance coverage limit 
borrowings  especially from the fhlb and repurchase agreements  also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans  and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically  or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include adverse regulatory action against us or a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated 
our ability to borrow also could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets  negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations  or continued deterioration in credit markets 
we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
should we be required by regulatory authorities to raise additional capital  we may seek to do so through the issuance of  among other things  our common stock or preferred stock 
the issuance of additional shares of common stock or convertible securities to new stockholders would be dilutive to our current stockholders 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions  our financial performance  and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
there may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities 
the market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur 
our board of directors is authorized to issue additional common stock  as well as classes or series of preferred stock  generally without any action on the part of the stockholders 
in addition  the board has the power  generally without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights  and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation  dissolution  or winding up of our business and other terms 
if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market value of the common stock could be adversely affected 

table of contents anti takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders 
provisions in our charter and bylaws  the corporate law of the state of maryland and federal regulations could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  or otherwise adversely affect the market price of any class of our equity securities  including our common stock 
these provisions include a prohibition on voting shares of common stock beneficially owned in excess of of total shares outstanding  supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations with any person who beneficially owns more than of our outstanding common stock  the election of directors to staggered terms of three years  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors  and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings  a requirement that only directors may fill a vacancy in our board of directors  supermajority voting requirements to remove any of our directors and the other provisions of our charter 
our charter also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock  and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal 
in addition  pursuant to federal and state laws and regulations  as a general matter  no person or company  acting individually or in concert with others  may acquire more than of our common stock without prior approval from our regulators 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 
the voting limitation provision in our charter could limit your voting rights as a holder of our common stock 
our charter provides that any person or group who acquires beneficial ownership of our common stock in excess of of the outstanding shares may not vote the excess shares 
accordingly  if you acquire beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  your voting rights with respect to the common stock will not be commensurate with your economic interest in our company 
we currently hold a significant amount of bank owned life insurance 
at december   we held million of bank owned life insurance boli on key employees and executives  with a cash surrender value of million 
the policies are maintained to fund amounts owed under executive supplemental retirement plans 
the eventual repayment of the cash surrender value is subject to the ability of the various insurance companies to pay death benefits or to return the cash surrender value to us if needed for liquidity purposes 
we continually monitor the financial strength of the various companies with whom we carry these policies 
however  any one of these companies could experience a decline in financial strength  which could impair its ability to pay benefits or return our cash surrender value 
if we need to liquidate these policies for liquidity purposes  we would be subject to taxation on the increase in cash surrender value and penalties for early termination  both of which would adversely impact earnings 
if our investment in the fhlb becomes impaired  our earnings and stockholders equity could decrease 
at december   we owned million in fhlb stock 
we are required to own this stock to be a member of and to obtain advances from our fhlb 
this stock is not marketable and can only be redeemed by our fhlb 
our fhlb s financial condition is linked  in part  to the eleven other members of the fhlb system and to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their capital  which would cause our fhlb stock to be deemed impaired  resulting in a decrease in our earnings and assets 

table of contents changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income 
the bank and the company are subject to extensive regulation  supervision  and examination by federal and state regulators  which have extensive discretion in connection with its supervisory and enforcement activities  including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank s operations  reclassify assets  determine the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change 
any change in these regulations and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  new regulations  or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations 
in response to the recent financial crisis  congress took actions that are intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in financial institutions  and the fdic has taken actions to increase insurance coverage on deposit accounts 
the recently enacted dodd frank act provides for the creation of the cfpb  which has broad authority to issue regulations governing the services and products we provide consumers 
this additional regulation could increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely impact our operations 
that legislation also contains provisions that  over time  could result in higher regulatory capital requirements and loan loss provisions for the company and the bank and may increase interest expense due to the ability to pay interest on all demand deposits 
the potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations  or changes in policy  affecting lending and funding practices and liquidity standards 
see how we are regulated 
in this recent economic downturn  federal and state banking regulators have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements 
the fdic and gdbf govern the activities in which the bank may engage  primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection or benefit of stockholders 
in addition  new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect our operations 
new laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the markets for and value of our loans and investments  the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations  costs  and profitability 
increases in deposit insurance premiums and special fdic assessments could negatively impact our earnings 
our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain deposit insurance 
as an fdic insured institution  we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the fdic 
although we cannot predict what the insurance assessment rates will be in the future  either deterioration in our risk based capital ratios or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
see how we are regulated and heritagebank of the south insurance of accounts and regulation by the fdic 
strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
we compete with numerous commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  securities brokers  and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have  have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business  and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area 
the greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our core deposits and interest earning assets 
our accounting policies and methods impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
application of these policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives  any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative 
these accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations 
they may require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain 
materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

table of contents our controls and procedures may be ineffective 
we regularly review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls  and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures 
as a result  we may incur increased costs to maintain and improve our controls and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls or procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
system failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  or a similar catastrophic event  as well as from security breaches  denial of service attacks  viruses  worms  and other disruptive problems caused by hackers 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
computer break ins  phishing and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us 
although we  with the help of third party service providers  intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage  there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful 
in addition  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data 
a failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure 
our business operations rely on third party vendors  which provide services such as data processing  recording and monitoring transactions  online banking interfaces and services  internet connections and network access 
while we have selected these third party vendors carefully  we do not control their actions 
any problems caused by these third parties  including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor  failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes  cyber attacks and security breaches at a vendor  failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business 
financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor ability to serve us 
furthermore  our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us  including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints 
replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense 
accordingly  use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations 
implementation of our stock based incentive plan may dilute stockholders ownership interests 
as of december   there were approximately  restricted shares and  stock options reserved for future awards under our two equity incentive plans 
these stock based incentive plans may be funded either through open market purchases or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of heritage common stock 
while our intention is to fund this plan through open market purchases  stockholders would experience approximately a reduction in ownership interest in the event  newly issued shares of our common stock are issued upon exercise of stock options or issued as restricted stock under these plans 

table of contents additional compensation and benefit expenses associated with the implementation of our stock based incentive benefit plans will affect our profitability adversely 
as awards are granted under our two equity incentive plans  our non interest expenses are likely to increase as we will recognize additional annual employee compensation and benefit expenses related to the shares granted to employees  executives and directors under these plans 
we cannot predict the actual amount of these new stock related compensation and benefit expenses because applicable accounting practices require that expenses be based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock at specific points in the future  however  we expect them to be material 
in addition  we will recognize expense for our employee stock ownership plan when shares are committed to be released to participants accounts ie  as the loan used to acquire these shares is repaid  and we will recognize expense for restricted stock awards and stock options over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 
our common stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market 
however  the average daily trading volume in our common stock is less than that of many larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired depth  liquidity  and orderliness depends on the presence of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers for our common stock at any given time 
this presence is impacted by general economic and market conditions and investors views of our company 
because our trading volume is limited  any significant sale of our shares is subject to significant volatility in the price of our common stock 
the ownership interest of management and employees could enable insiders to prevent a merger that may provide stockholders a premium for their shares 
our directors and executive officers own  shares  or  of the company s common stock and options for an additional  shares 
in addition  our employee stock ownership plan owns of the outstanding shares of heritage common stock 
this may result in management  directors  and employees controlling a significant percentage of shares of heritage common stock 
if these individuals were to act together  they could have significant influence over the outcome of any stockholder vote 
this voting power may discourage a potential sale of heritage that its public stockholders may desire 
various factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  federal regulations  georgia and maryland law  and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of heritage without the consent of our board of directors 
stockholders may want a takeover attempt to succeed because  for example  a potential acquiror could offer a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
we may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by heritage cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to heritage 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

part ii item market for registrant common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities the company s common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market under the symbol hbos 
the shares began trading on november  prior to that date  the shares of common stock of the predecessor also traded on that market under the same symbol 
as of december   the company estimates that it had approximately  stockholders  including approximately  beneficial owners holding shares in nominee or street name 
the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of the shares of common stock of the company and cash dividends paid to public stockholders 
high low dividends paid per share fourth quarter through third quarter through second quarter through first quarter through fourth quarter through third quarter through second quarter through first quarter through 
table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the company paid a special one time dividend of in lieu of regular quarterly dividends that would have been anticipated to be paid in the company intends to resume paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the continued payment of dividends also will depend on a number of factors  including our capital requirements  our financial condition and results of operations  tax considerations  statutory and regulatory limitations  and general economic conditions 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay dividends or that they will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 
the company s ability to pay dividends depends on the company s unconsolidated available funds and earnings thereon  as well as dividends from heritagebank 
under the rules of the frb  the company is not permitted to pay dividends on its common stock if its stockholders equity would be reduced below the amount of the liquidation account established in connection with the conversion 
similarly  heritagebank will not be permitted to pay dividends to the company  its sole stockholder  if heritagebank s stockholder s equity would be reduced below the amount of the liquidation account established in connection with the conversion 
in addition  heritagebank will not be permitted to make a capital distribution if  after making such distribution  capital would be below regulatory capital guidelines or if it does not receive frb authorization to pay the dividend 
georgia law and regulations imposes limits on dividend payments by heritagebank and certain levels of dividends require the prior approval of the gdbf 
see item business limitations on dividends and other capital distributions 
maryland law generally limits dividends by heritage to an amount equal to the excess of our capital surplus over payments that would be owed upon dissolution to stockholders whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior to those receiving the dividend  and to an amount that would not make us insolvent 
finally  pursuant to frb regulations  during the three year period following the second step conversion  which closed on november   we may not take any action to declare an extraordinary dividend to stockholders that would be treated by recipients as a tax free return of capital for federal income tax purposes 
the company has two equity incentive plans providing for the issuance of stock options  restricted stock  restricted share units and stock appreciation rights

expansion efforts 
a key element of our business strategy is increasing our presence and growing the heritage brand in the markets we currently serve and expanding our operations beyond our original southwest georgia market by entering new markets in other parts of southern georgia  north central florida  eastern alabama and other adjacent communities that present attractive opportunities for expansion consistent with our capital availability 
this expansion of our market beyond southwest georgia began in  when we commenced operating a branch in ocala  florida 
we have pursued this expansion program through both prudent  disciplined internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
many troubled financial institutions throughout our market footprint have closed or curtailed their lending activities  decreased their assets or sold branches to improve their capital which has given us the opportunity to expand through organic loan demand and attractive branch acquisitions 
we have also hired highly regarded and experienced lending officers and commercial bankers and expanded into new market areas that are contiguous to our existing market areas 
these recent activities reflect our ability to take advantage of these expansion opportunities 

table of contents marked a milestone in our expansion activity with the purchase and assumption of two fdic assisted acquisitions near savannah  georgia and in statesboro  georgia 
in april  we opened a commercial banking office in macon  georgia  and in june  we completed the purchase of a single branch in auburn  alabama 
the auburn  alabama branch purchase resulted in the transfer of million in loans and million in deposits 
in august  we hired a new management team to operate our mortgage division which is expected to lead significant growth in our mortgage business  particularly in the atlanta  georgia market 
in march  we completed the fdic assisted whole bank purchase of frontier bank  a nine branch full service bank based in lagrange  georgia with approximately million in loans and million in deposits 
critical accounting policies we have established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in item notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which has a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by us represent critical accounting policies 
for more information on our accounting policies  see item note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition accounting 
gaap require the use of fair value accounting in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations and accordingly we recorded assets purchased and liabilities assumed in our fdic assisted acquisitions at their fair values 
the fair value of the loan portfolios acquired in these transactions was recorded and is being accounted for under the principles prescribed by asc on the date of acquisition all loans acquired are assigned a fair value based on the present value of projected future cash flows 
an accretable discount is determined based on the timing of the projected cash flows and is taken into income over the projected life of the loans 
such accretion is included in interest income 
expected cash flows are re estimated at each reporting date 
subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses 
subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted the accretable discount  which will have a positive effect on interest income 
because we record loans acquired in connection with fdic assisted acquisitions at fair value  we record no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired covered loans on the acquisition date  given that the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk 
acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
purchased assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the purchase date 
any identifiable intangible assets are also recorded at fair value 
when the fair value of the assets purchased exceed the fair value of liabilities assumed  a bargain purchase gain results 
if the consideration given exceeds the fair value of the net assets received  goodwill is recognized 
fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available 
fdic receivable for loss share agreements 
a significant portion of our acquired loan and other real estate assets are covered under loss share agreements with the fdic in which the fdic has agreed to reimburse the company of all losses as well as certain expenses incurred in connection with those assets 
we estimate the amount that we will receive from the fdic under the loss share agreements that will result from losses incurred as covered loans and other real estate assets are disposed  and an estimate of the receivable from the fdic is recorded 
we discount the receivable for the expected timing and receipt of those cash flows using a risk free rate plus a premium for risk 
the accretion of the fdic receivable discount is recorded into noninterest income using the level yield method over the estimated life of the receivable 

table of contents the loss share agreements also include a provision whereby if losses do not exceed a calculated threshold  we are obligated to compensate the fdic 
this is referred to as a clawback liability and  if applicable  is paid at the end of ten years 
the formula for the clawback liability varies from transaction to transaction and will be calculated using the formula provided in the individual loss share agreements and will not be consolidated into one calculation 
the fdic receivable for loss share agreements is measured separately from the related covered assets because it is not contractually embedded in the assets and is not transferable if the assets are sold 
we will review and update the fair value of the fdic receivable at each reporting date in conjunction with the re estimation of cash flows 
the fdic receivable will fluctuate as loss estimates and expected cash flows related to covered loans and other real estate owned change 
loans held for sale 
loans held for sale consist of one to four family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market and are carried at fair value under asc for residential mortgage loans  fair value is determined by outstanding commitments from investors for committed loans and on the basis of current delivery prices in the secondary mortgage market for uncommitted loans  if any 
adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale of the loans are classified as noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
we enter into interest rate lock commitments irlcs with customers on mortgage loans with the intention to sell the loan in the secondary market 
the company classifies irlcs on residential mortgage loans  which are derivatives under asc  on a gross basis within other liabilities or other assets 
the derivatives arising from the irlcs are recorded at fair value in other assets and liabilities and changes in that fair value are included in mortgage banking activities 
the fair value of the irlc derivatives are determined by reference to quoted prices for loans with similar coupon rates and terms 
the fair value of these commitments  while based on interest rates observable in the market  is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans 
these pullthrough rates are based on historical data and the current interest rate environment and reflect the best estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan 
gains and losses on the sale of those loans are included in mortgage banking activities 
as a result of the adoption of sab no 
 the loan servicing value is also included in the fair value of irlcs 
for further information on the fair value accounting for residential mortgages held for sale  see item note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses alll 
we established provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  at a level believed to reflect probable credit losses based on historical loss trends and an evaluation of specific credits in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio  five year historical loss experience  migration analysis  probability of default  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions  and past due status and trends 
we analyze the non fdic acquired loan portfolios through the use of pools of homogenous loan types and through a specific quarterly review of larger problem loans 
it is expected that a certain percentage of loans will move through the asset quality grades from pass  to classified and ultimately loss 
we evaluate the non fdic loan portfolio through review of four loan pool categories 
pass credits with risk ratings special mention with risk ratings substandard with risk rating and still accruing impaired loans with risk ratings nonaccrual and troubled debt restructurings asset quality grades are described in item note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the allowance consists of two components a general amount we analyze the historical migration of loans through each risk rating category and analyze the history of losses as it relates to the various loan types and collateral types in order to evaluate and estimate the volume  magnitude and direction these events 
these risk factors and other factors are applied to our review of the pass credits with risk ratings pool and other assets specially mentioned with risk rating pool 
these factors are applied to the substandard pool  however  in addition to reviewing the pool  a select group of individual loans are reviewed 
the results of the individual review are factored in with the historical loss analysis and applied to the pool 
a specific amount impaired loans are reviewed individually for specific amounts that are representative of identified credit exposures that are readily predictable by the current performance of the borrower and underlying collateral 
impaired loans with balances lower than  are not typically reviewed on an individual basis due to their small size 
instead  a historical loss analysis is used for these loans  which assumes the loan migration to default is likely  and the assumed loss is recorded as a specific amount 
even though the alll is composed of two components  the entire alll is available to absorb any credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and we make provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the proper level of allowance 
while we use available information to recognize losses on loans  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  where such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable 
the level of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from the estimates
