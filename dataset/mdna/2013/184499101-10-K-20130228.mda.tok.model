item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion in this section contains forward looking statements 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
we have attempted to identify forward looking statements by terminology such as anticipate  believe  can  continue  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  potential  predict  should  would or will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology  but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward looking 
these statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which could cause our actual results to differ from those projected in any forward looking statements we make 
see risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties 
this discussion should be read with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
we are the leading provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets in the united states and canada  based on the number of stations operated and the amount of gasoline gallon equivalents of compressed natural gas cng and liquefied natural gas lng delivered 
we design  build  operate and maintain fueling stations and supply our customers with cng fuel for light  medium and heavy duty vehicles and lng fuel for medium and heavy duty vehicles 
we also sell non lubricated natural gas compressors and related equipment used in cng stations and lng stations  convert light and medium duty vehicles to run on natural gas  provide design and engineering services for natural gas engine systems  and produce renewable natural gas rng  which can be used as vehicle fuel or sold for power generation 
in addition  we help our customers acquire and finance natural gas vehicles and obtain local  state and federal grants and incentives 
overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
sources of revenue 
we generate revenues by selling cng and lng  providing operations and maintenance o m services to our vehicle fleet customers  designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing those stations to our customers  selling rng  selling converted natural gas vehicles  selling non lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment and maintenance services  providing financing for our customers natural gas vehicle purchases and selling tradable credits we generate by selling natural gas and rng as a vehicle fuel  including credits lcfs credits under the california low carbon fuel standard 
key operating data 
in evaluating our operating performance  our management focuses primarily on the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents delivered which we define as i the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents we sell to our customers  plus ii the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents dispensed to our customers at stations where we provide o m services  but do not sell the cng or lng  plus iii our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents sold as cng by our joint venture in peru  plus iv our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents of rng produced and sold as pipeline quality natural gas by our rng production facility in dallas  texas  our gross margin which we define as revenue minus cost of sales  and net income loss attributable to us 
the following table  which you should read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k  presents our key operating data for the years ended december    and gasoline gallon equivalents delivered year ended december  in millions cng rng lng total operating data in thousands gross margin net loss attributable to clean energy fuels 
corp key trends in  and according to the eia  demand for natural gas fuels in the united states increased by approximately during the period january  through december  we believe this growth in demand was attributable primarily to the rising prices of gasoline and diesel relative to cng and lng during these periods and increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets 
the number of fueling stations we served grew during the past three years from at december  to at december  a increase 
included in this number are all of the cng and lng fueling stations we own  maintain or with which we have a fueling supply contract 
the amount of cng  rng  and lng gasoline gallon equivalents we delivered from to increased by 
the increase in gasoline gallon equivalents delivered was the primary contributor to increased revenues during  and in addition  beginning in  we also benefitted from increased revenues from compressor sales and fueling station installations as a result of our acquisitions of imw industries  ltd 
imw and wyoming northstar incorporated and its affiliated companies northstar  which occurred during the third and fourth quarters of in  we sold four large transit stations for million  which contributed to our revenue increase during the year 
our cost of sales also increased during these periods  which was attributable primarily to increased costs related to delivering more cng and lng to our customers in through in  the cost of sales related to compressors sold through imw and fueling station installations performed by northstar also contributed to the increase 
in  the cost of sales related to increased station construction sales contributed to our increase in cost of sales 
since the last half of  we have experienced reduced margins in certain markets  particularly in the municipal transit and refuse sectors 
the reduction in margins is primarily a result of increased competition and sales agreements with larger entities that have greater pricing leverage 
also  in many cases  our agreements with our customers  including governmental agencies  are subject to a competitive bidding process and we have been required to reduce our prices to maintain our contracts as they come up for bid 
in addition  in may and june of  we acquired four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance services contracts with municipal transit agencies  and in and  we won several contracts with a transit agency in california that have significant volume but smaller margins than we typically generate on our fuel sales 
as a result of all of these factors  the overall average margin on our fuel sales across our business decreased in we believe that our margins on fuel sales will improve in the future to the extent we are successful in increasing our retail cng and lng fueling operations  which is where we earn our highest margins 
if our retail cng and lng fueling operations do not grow  we may experience further reduced margins 
we may also lose contracts with governmental customers if we are unwilling or unable to reduce our prices or lose in the competitive bidding process  which would reduce our volumes 
we will need to increase our business with non government entities to replace volumes lost in competitive bid procurements when we are not successful in retaining the contracts 
during and  prices for oil  gasoline  and diesel fuel were generally substantially higher than the price for natural gas 
oil hit a high of in february and settled at per barrel on december  in california  average retail prices for gasoline were per gallon in january and hit a high of per gallon in october before moving down to per gallon at december  average retail prices for diesel fuel in california were per diesel gallon in january and hit a high of per diesel gallon in september before moving down to per diesel gallon at december  higher gasoline and diesel prices improve our margins on fuel sales to the extent we price our fuel at a discount to gasoline or diesel and natural gas prices do not increase by a corresponding amount 
during this time period  the price for natural gas increased slightly 
the nymex price for natural gas ranged from per mmbtu in january to per mmbtu in december the average retail sales price of our cng fuel sold in the los angeles metropolitan area ranged from per gallon for the month of january to per gallon for the month of december the average retail sales price of our lng fuel sold in the los angeles metropolitan area ranged from per gallon during january to per gallon for the month of december recent developments 
in april  we exercised our option to acquire the remaining of servotech engineering  inc servotech  a company that provides design and engineering services for natural gas fueling systems among other services  for million 
in july  we received million from chesapeake ng ventures corporation chesapeake in accordance with our note arrangement see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  we entered into a finance arrangement with general electric ge to finance the acquisition of two lng plants see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  certain federal fuel tax credits were extended through december  and made retroactive to january  the amount attributed to  estimated to be million  will be recorded by us in the first quarter of  the period in which the law was passed 
we have agreed to sell our ownership interest in our joint venture in peru for approximately million after receiving a dividend distribution of approximately million see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to close the sale by march  in january and february  an aggregate of million of principal and accrued interest under an slg note was converted by the holder into  shares of our common stock see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
anticipated future trends 
we anticipate that  over the long term  the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be significantly higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel  and more stringent emissions requirements will continue to make natural gas vehicles an attractive alternative to traditional gasoline and diesel powered vehicles 
our belief that natural gas will continue  over the long term  to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in large part on the growth in united states natural gas production in recent years 
we believe there will be significant growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among vehicle fleets  and our goal is to capitalize on this trend and enhance our leadership position as this market expands 
with our acquisitions of imw and northstar  we are a fully integrated provider of advanced compression technology  station building and fueling 
we also anticipate expanding our sales of cng and lng in the other markets in which we operate  including trucking  refuse hauling  airports  taxis and public transit 
consistent with the anticipated growth of our business  we also expect that our operating costs and capital expenditures will increase  primarily from the anticipated expansion of our station network or lng production capacity  as well as the logistics of delivering more cng and lng to our customers 
we also anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire assets and or businesses that are in the natural gas fueling infrastructure or rng production business that may require us to raise additional capital 
additionally  we have and will continue to increase our sales and marketing team and other necessary personnel as we seek to expand our existing markets and enter new markets  which will also result in increased costs 
we anticipate the commercial roll out of natural gas engines that are well suited for the us heavy duty over the road otr trucking market  together with the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas fuel  will result in increased adoption of natural gas fueled trucks by the us trucking industry 
heavy duty trucks in the united states are generally high volume consumers of vehicle fuel  and we believe many use  gallons or more per truck per year  and the lower cost of natural gas compared to regular gasoline and diesel would result in substantial fuel savings for the operator 
with over eight million heavy duty trucks registered in the us market  we believe that this market may become our largest market 
as a result  we have made a significant commitment of capital and other resources to build a nationwide network of lng truck fueling stations  which we refer to as america natural gas highway  or angh  on the interstate highway system and in major metropolitan areas that will enable natural gas fueled freight trucking coast to coast and border to border within the continental states 
we expect america natural gas highway to initially include approximately truck fueling stations  of which angh stations were completed at the end of of these stations  seven are open and selling lng  and the remainder are planned to open as natural gas engines that are well suited for the trucking market including the cwi liter engine become available and trucks powered by such engines are deployed in the geographic areas where the stations are located 
we expect to build approximately additional angh stations in  depending upon the deployment of natural gas trucks  demand for lng  and our ability to identify and obtain suitable locations for lng stations  among other things 
many angh stations are located at pilot flying j travel centers already serving goods movement trucking 
many governmental entities  which represented approximately of our revenues from through  are experiencing significant budget deficits and have been  and may continue to be  unable to invest in new natural gas vehicles for their transit or refuse fleets 
they may also be compelled to reduce public transportation and services  or the prices they pay for these services  which would negatively affect our business 
sources of liquidity and anticipated capital expenditures 
liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows  the sale or maturity of existing assets  or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management 
historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities 
our business plan calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations  including angh stations  expanding and constructing our lng plants  expanding and building landfill gas processing plants  and the purchase of lng trailers 
we may also elect to invest additional amounts in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries  including rng production  and to make capital expenditures to build additional lng production facilities or to otherwise secure future lng supply 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund any capital expenditures or investments that we cannot fund through available cash or cash generated by operations 
the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend on our rate of new station construction and potential merger or acquisition activity 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures below 
we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and may reduce our ability to grow our business and generate increased revenues 
business risks and uncertainties 
our business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties 
for more information  see risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
operations we generate revenues by selling cng and lng and providing o m services to our vehicle fleet customers 
for the year ended december   cng and rng together represented and lng represented of our natural gas sales on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis 
to a lesser extent  we generate revenues by designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing those stations to our customers 
we also generate revenues through sales of rng  sales of natural gas vehicles  sales of advanced natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment and maintenance services  providing financing for our customers natural gas vehicle purchases  and selling rins and lcfs credits 
cng sales we sell cng through fueling stations located on our customers properties and through our network of public access fueling stations 
at these cng fueling stations  we procure natural gas from local utilities or brokers under standard  floating rate arrangements and then compress and dispense it into our customers vehicles 
our cng sales are made primarily through contracts with our fleet customers 
under these contracts  pricing is principally determined on an index plus basis  which is calculated by adding a margin to the local index or utility price for natural gas 
cng sales revenues based on an index plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
we also sell a small amount of cng under fixed price contracts 
we will continue to offer fixed price contracts as appropriate and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy 
our fleet customers typically are billed monthly based on the volume of cng sold at a station 
the remainder of our cng sales are on a per fill up basis at prices we set at the pump based on prevailing market conditions 
these customers typically pay using a credit card at the station 
lng production and sales we obtain lng from our own plants as well as through relationships with suppliers 
we own and operate lng liquefaction plants near houston  texas and boron  california  and we plan to build two new lng plants in connection with our strategic collaboration with ge 
we expect that these additional plants  as well as our planned expansion of our boron  california plant  and other plants to be built by us or third parties in the future  will be necessary to secure sufficient sources of lng for angh 
we sell lng to fleet customers  who typically own and operate their fueling stations 
increasingly  we also sell lng to fleet and other customers at our public access lng stations 
during  we procured of our lng from third party producers  and we produced the remainder of the lng at our liquefaction plants in texas and california 
we expect to enter additional purchase contracts with third party lng producers in the future 
for lng that we purchase from third parties  we have entered into  and may enter into additional take or pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of lng at index based rates 
we deliver lng via our fleet of tanker trailers to fueling stations  where it is stored and dispensed in liquid form into vehicles 
we sell lng principally through supply contracts that are priced on either a fixed price or index plus basis 
lng sales revenues based on an index plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
we will continue to offer fixed price contracts as appropriate and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy 
our lng contracts provide that we charge our customers periodically based on the volume of lng supplied 
we also sell lng on a per fill up basis at prices we set at the pump based on prevailing market conditions 
these customers typically pay using a credit card at the station 
government incentives from october  through december   we received a federal fuel tax credit vetc of per gasoline gallon equivalent of cng and per liquid gallon of lng that we sold as vehicle fuel 
based on the service relationship with our customers  either we or our customers were able to claim the credit 
we recorded these tax credits as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations as the credits are fully refundable and do not need to offset tax liabilities to be received 
as such  the credits are not deemed income tax credits under the accounting guidance applicable to income taxes 
in addition  we believe the credits are properly recorded as revenue because we often incorporate the tax credits into our pricing with our customers  thereby lowering the actual price per gallon we charge them 
the american taxpayer relief act  signed into law on january   provides one year extensions for several tax credits affecting alternative fuels  including the per gallon alternative fuel tax credit for cng and lng 
the tax credits were extended through december  and made retroactive to january  such credits for are estimated to be million  which will be recognized during the first quarter of  the period in which the extension was signed into law 
on july   the irs sent us a letter i disallowing approximately million related to certain claims we made from october  to june  under the vetc program  and ii seeking repayment of such amount 
after negotiations with the irs and the other impacted parties  we settled the dispute for million in operation and maintenance we generate a portion of our revenue from operation and maintenance agreements for cng and lng fueling stations where we do not supply the fuel 
we refer to this portion of our business as o m 
at these fueling stations the customer contracts directly with a local broker or utility to purchase natural gas 
for o m services  we do not sell the fuel itself  but generally charge a per gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station 
we include the volume of fuel dispensed at the stations at which we provide o m services in our calculation of aggregate gasoline gallon equivalents delivered 
station construction we generate a portion of our revenue from designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing the stations to our customers 
for these projects  we act as general contractor or supervise qualified third party contractors 
we charge construction fees or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project 
vehicle acquisition and finance we offer vehicle finance services for some of our customers purchases of natural gas vehicles or the conversion of their existing gasoline or diesel powered vehicles to operate on natural gas 
we loan to certain qualifying customers a portion of  and on occasion up to of  the purchase price of their natural gas vehicles 
we may also lease vehicles in the future 
where appropriate  we apply for and receive state and federal incentives associated with natural gas vehicle purchases and pass these benefits through to our customers 
we may also secure vehicles to place with customers or pay deposits with respect to such vehicles prior to receiving a firm order from our customers  which we may be required to purchase if our customer fails to purchase the vehicle as anticipated 
through december   we have not generated significant revenue from vehicle financing activities 
rng we own a interest in a rng production facility at the mccommas bluff landfill located in dallas  texas 
we sell rng produced at the facility to shell energy north america under a gas sale agreement and  depending upon rng production volumes  we have the ability to sell rng as a vehicle fuel 
we own a second rng production facility located at a republic services landfill in canton  michigan 
this facility was completed in  and we have entered into a ten year fixed price sale contract for the majority of the rng that we expect the facility to produce the effectiveness of such contract is subject to the cec certifying the facility 
we are building a third rng facility at a republic services landfill in north shelby  tennessee  and we expect the facility to be operational during the first quarter of we are seeking to expand our rng business by pursuing additional rng production projects 
we sell some of the rng we currently produce  and expect to sell a significant amount of the rng we produce at the facilities we are building and plan to build  through our natural gas fueling infrastructure for use as a vehicle fuel 
in addition  we plan to purchase rng from third party producers  and sell that rng for vehicle use through our fueling infrastructure 
vehicle conversions our subsidiary  baf technologies  inc baf  provides natural gas vehicle ngv conversions  alternative fuel systems  application engineering  service and warranty support and research and development 
baf vehicle conversions include taxis  vans  pick up trucks and shuttle buses 
baf utilizes advanced natural gas system integration technology and has certified ngvs under both epa and carb standards achieving super ultra low emission vehicle emissions 
in  we completed our purchase of all of servotech 
servotech provides  among other services  design and engineering services for natural gas engine systems 
we generate revenues through the sale of natural gas vehicles that have been converted to run on natural gas by baf  and design and engineering services for natural gas engine systems by servotech 
the majority of baf revenue during and was derived from sales of converted natural gas service vans to at t 
for the years ended december  and  baf and servotech combined contributed approximately million  and million  respectively  to our revenue 
natural gas fueling compressors our subsidiary  imw  manufactures and services non lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment for the global natural gas fueling market 
imw is headquartered near vancouver  british columbia  has other manufacturing facilities near shanghai  china  and in ferndale  washington  and has sales and service offices in bangladesh  colombia  peru and the united states 
for the years ended december  and  imw contributed approximately million and million  respectively  to our revenue 
sales of rins and lcfs credits we generate lcfs credits when we sell rng and conventional natural gas for use as a vehicle fuel in california  and we generate rins when we sell rng for use as a vehicle fuel 
we can sell these rins and lcfs credits to third parties who need the rins and the lcfs credits to comply with federal and state requirements 
in  we realized million in revenue through the sale of lcfs credits 
we anticipate that we will generate and sell increasing numbers of rins and lcfs credits as we grow our business and sell escalating amounts of cng  lng and rng for use as a vehicle fuel 
volatility of earnings and cash flows during   and  our futures contracts qualified for hedge accounting  so we had no derivative gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for these periods 
in accordance with our natural gas hedging policy  we plan to structure all futures contracts as cash flow hedges under the applicable derivative accounting guidance  but we cannot be certain that they will qualify 
see risk management activities below 
if the futures contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  we could incur significant increases or decreases in our earnings based on fluctuations in the market value of the contracts from period to period 
additionally  we are required to maintain a margin account to cover losses related to our natural gas futures contracts 
futures contracts are valued daily  and if our contracts are in loss positions at the end of a trading day  our broker will transfer the amount of the losses from our margin account to a clearinghouse 
if at any time the funds in our margin account drop below a specified maintenance level  our broker will issue a margin call that requires us to restore the balance 
consequently  these payments could significantly impact our cash balances 
at december   we had paid million in margin deposits  which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the decrease in the value of our futures positions and any corresponding margin deposits required thereon could significantly impact our financial position in the future 
volatility of earnings related to series i warrants beginning january   under financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance  we are required to record the change in the fair market value of our series i warrants in our consolidated financial statements 
we have recognized a gain of million and million related to recording the estimated fair market value changes of our series i warrants in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
our earnings or loss per share may be materially affected by future gains or losses we are required to recognize as a result of valuing our series i warrants 
on november    of the series i warrants were exercised 
as of december    of the series i warrants remained outstanding 
volatility of earnings related to contingent consideration under business combination accounting guidance  we are required to record the change in the value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of both baf and imw in our financial statements through the contingency period  which expired december  for baf and expires on march  for imw 
if the anticipated results of imw increase or decrease during future periods  we may be required to recognize material losses or gains based on the valuation of the increased or decreased consideration due to the former imw shareholder 
during  we recognized a gain of million related to the estimated change in value of the imw contingent consideration 
our earnings or loss per share may be materially affected by future gains or losses we are required to recognize as a result of changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration amount 
debt compliance in connection with our acquisition of imw  we entered into a credit agreement with hsbc that requires imw to comply with certain financial covenants see note to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to violate a covenant  we would seek a waiver from the bank  which the bank is not obligated to grant 
if the bank does not grant a waiver  all of the obligations under the credit agreement would be due and payable 
imw was in compliance with these covenants as of december  the indenture and the loan agreement entered into by dallas clean energy mccommas bluff  llc dcemb  our owned subsidiary  as part of issuing its revenue bonds  as defined and disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements  have certain non financial debt covenants with which dcemb must comply 
as of december   dcemb was in compliance with its debt covenants 
the loan agreement we entered into as part of issuing the chk notes  as defined and discussed elsewhere in this item and in note to our consolidated financial statements  has certain non financial debt covenants with which we must comply 
as of december   we were in compliance with these debt covenants 
the convertible note purchase agreements we entered into as part of issuing the slg notes  as defined and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  have certain non financial debt covenants with which we must comply 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the ge credit agreement  as defined and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  contains certain covenants with which we must comply 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
risk management activities some of our natural gas fuel sales contracts require us to sell lng or cng to our customers at a fixed price 
these contracts expose us to the risk that the price of natural gas may increase above the natural gas cost component included in the price at which we are committed to sell gas to our customers 
in an effort to mitigate the volatility of our earnings related to our futures contracts and to reduce our risk related to fixed price sales contracts  we operate under a natural gas hedging policy pursuant to which we only purchase futures contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular fixed price contract or bid 
subject to the conditions set forth in the policy  we purchase futures contracts in quantities reasonably expected to effectively hedge our exposure to cash flow variability related to such fixed price sales contracts entered into after the date of the policy 
unless otherwise agreed in advance by the board of directors and the derivative committee  we will conduct our futures activities and enter into fixed price sales contracts only in accordance with the natural gas hedging policy  a complete copy of which  as amended effective may   was filed as exhibit to our form k filed with the sec on june  the summary of the policy described above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the policy previously filed 
due to the restrictions of our revised hedging policy  we expect to offer fewer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
if we do offer a fixed price sales contract  we anticipate including a price component that would cover our estimated cash requirements over the duration of the underlying futures contracts 
the amount of this price component will vary based on the anticipated volume and the natural gas price component to be covered under the fixed price sales contracts 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  asset realization  accounts receivable reserves  notes receivable reserves  warranty reserves  derivative values  income taxes  and the fair value of equity instruments granted as stock based compensation 
we use historical experience  market quotes  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets before  we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual evaluations if events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount 
beginning in  we performed our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill under the amended guidance issued by the fasb in accounting standards update asu  testing for goodwill impairment  issued in september  which we chose to early adopt 
under the amended requirements of asu  an entity is not required to quantitatively determine a reporting unit fair value if it concludes  based upon a qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the guidance also allows us to proceed directly to a quantitative analysis on an individual reporting unit basis  which we do when there is doubt about whether or not a qualitative assessment is sufficient or when there is an indicator of impairment 
beginning on october   we performed our test for indefinite lived intangible assets impairment under the amended guidance issued by the fasb in asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  issued in july  which we chose to early adopt  effective october  the amended requirements of asu provide a similar framework for testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as asu does for testing goodwill for impairment 
there were no impairment charges for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset resulting from the october  or impairment testing  and no events have occurred subsequent to october  which indicate impairment may have occurred as of december  we test tangible and intangible long lived assets with definite useful lives for impairment whenever circumstances or events may affect the recoverability of the long lived assets 
the evaluation is primarily dependent on the estimated future cash flows of the assets and the fair value of these items  as determined by management based on a number of estimates  including future cash flow projections  discount rates and terminal values 
in determining these estimates  management considers internally generated information and information obtained from discussions with market participants 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
the impairment test for long lived assets is a two step process 
the first step is to assess if events or changes in circumstances have affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
if management believes that recoverability has been affected  then step two requires management to calculate the undiscounted future cash flow related to the asset or asset group and to compare the cash flow to the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value  then there is no impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to an operating and maintenance contract we lost in a competitive bid to a competitor 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  our subsidiary  dallas clean energy  llc dce  our wholly owned subsidiary and owner of dcemb  expensed approximately million of costs related to equipment that was replaced as part of its expansion of the mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our investment in vpg 
we had no impairment charges during warranty reserves our warranty periods range up to thirty six months  depending on the product or service 
we provide a warranty reserve for estimated product warranty costs at the time the applicable sale is recognized 
we continuously monitor and analyze warranty claims and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and future assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of repair vary from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
natural gas derivative activities fasb authoritative guidance for our derivative instruments  specifically for our natural gas futures contracts  requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
for those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives directly to our consolidated statements of operations 
for those contracts that do qualify for hedge accounting  we record the changes in the fair value in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity 
we determine the fair value of our derivatives at the end of each reporting period based on quoted market prices from the nymex discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts related to future periods 
the counter party to our derivative transactions is a high credit quality counterparty  however  we are subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty is unable to meet its settlement commitments 
we manage this credit risk by minimizing the number and size of our derivative contracts and by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
we record valuation adjustments against the derivative assets to reflect counterparty risk  if necessary 
the counterparty is also exposed to credit risk by us  which requires us to provide cash deposits as collateral when our contracts are in a liability position in the aggregate 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on our cng and lng gas sales and for our o m services in accordance with us gaap  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
applying these factors  we typically recognize revenue from the sale of natural gas at the time fuel is dispensed or  in the case of lng sales agreements  delivered to our customers storage facilities 
we recognize revenue from o m agreements as we provide the related services 
in certain transactions with our customers  we agree to provide multiple products or services  including construction of and sale of a station  providing o m to the station  and sale of fuel to the customer 
we evaluate the separability of revenues based on current fasb authoritative guidance  which provides a framework for establishing whether or not a particular arrangement with a customer has one or more revenue elements 
prior to  to the extent we had adequate objective evidence of the values of the separate elements indentified as part of a contract  we allocated the revenue from the contract on a relative fair value basis at the inception of the arrangement 
during and  we did not have objective evidence for our multi element arrangements  which generally resulted in the deferral of revenue until the future services are performed 
since  however  we have applied newly issued fasb authoritative guidance that allows us to use a combination of objective and reliable evidence to develop management best estimate of the fair value of the undelivered element 
if the arrangement contains a lease  we use the existing evidence of fair value to separate the lease from the other elements in the arrangement 
the arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the estimated relative selling price of each deliverable  which is determined based on the historical data derived from our stand alone projects 
the revenue allocated to the construction of station is recognized using completed contract method 
the revenue allocated to the o m and sale of fuel is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
we recognize revenue related to our leasing activities in accordance with current fasb authoritative guidance 
our existing station leases are sales type leases  giving rise to profit at the delivery of the leased station 
unearned revenue is amortized into income over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 
for those arrangements  we recognize gas sales and o m service revenues as earned from the customer on a volume delivered basis 
we typically recognize revenue on fueling station construction projects where we sell the station to the customer using the completed contract method 
the construction contract is considered to be substantially completed at the earlier of customer acceptance of the fueling station or the time when the fuel dispensing activities begin 
when applicable  multi station construction contracts are segmented into phases as negotiated with customers 
gross margin related to each phase is recognized at its substantial completion 
for imw and northstar  we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in those circumstances  revenue is recognized as work on a contract progresses  based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated costs to be incurred for that project 
we recognize revenue on rng sales and vehicle sales when we transfer title of the gas or vehicle to our customer 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees based on the grant date fair value 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of certain assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock price  expected dividends  if any  expected life of the stock option  and the risk free interest rate appropriate for the expected holding period 
income taxes we compute income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  are applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment 
we record a valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets when management determines it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
when evaluating the need for a valuation analysis  we use estimates involving a high degree of judgment including projected future income and the amounts and estimated timing of the reversal of any deferred tax liabilities 
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been given to such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated 
fair value estimates we have established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance 
the framework includes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances 
the hierarchy consists of the following three levels level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our significant uses of fair value measurements include recorded values of available for sale securities  allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions  assessments of impairment of long lived assets  assessments of impairment of goodwill  recorded values of derivative instruments  recorded values of contingent consideration obligations  and recorded values of warrants to purchase our common stock 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  a portion of this increase was the result of an increase in the number of gallons delivered between periods from million gasoline gallon equivalents to million gasoline gallon equivalents

we also experienced an increase of million gallons in cng volume between periods from our existing airport  transit  refuse and trucking customers  combined with the volume growth from our share of our joint venture in peru 
further  we experienced an increase of million in lng volume between periods  which was primarily due to a combination of million gallons from northstar o m services and million gallons from new trucking  transit  industrial and refuse customers 
we experienced an increase in our rng sales through our share of the rng sales at dcemb of million gallons due to increased rng production at dcemb facility

revenue also increased by million between periods due to increased sales of natural gas vehicle equipment by baf 
these increases were offset by the decrease in our effective price per gallon that we charged to our customers between periods 
our effective price per gallon charged was for the year ended december   which represents a per gallon decrease from in the year ended december  the decrease was due to a combination of lower natural gas prices in  upon which we base a portion of our pricing to our customers  and a higher percentage of o m contracts between periods  which generate less revenue per gallon than contracts where we supply the natural gas commodity 
revenue attributable to vetc also decreased between periods because the credits were not available in however  subsequent to the year end  the credits were reinstated for and made retroactive to january  we recorded million of revenue related to fuel tax credits in  and we will record our vetc credits in the first quarter of we also recorded a million reduction in revenue in related to the settlement of our dispute with the irs over certain vetc claims

seasonality and inflation to some extent  we experience seasonality in our results of operations 
natural gas vehicle fuel amounts consumed by some of our customers tends to be higher in summer months when buses and other fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems 
natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods 
since our inception  inflation has not significantly affected our operating results 
however  costs for construction  repairs  maintenance  electricity and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures and could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately  build new stations  build new lng plants and expand our existing facilities  or materially increase our operating costs 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for the construction of new fueling stations  construction of lng production facilities  the purchase of new lng tanker trailers  investment in rng production  mergers and acquisitions  the financing of natural gas vehicles for our customers and general corporate purposes  including making deposits to support our derivative activities  geographic expansion domestically and internationally  expanding our sales and marketing activities  support of legislative and regulatory initiatives and for working capital for our expansion

in addition  there was an increase of million in net proceeds that we received from the exercise of employee stock options between years 
we also experienced a decrease of million in repayment of capital lease obligations and debt instruments in  primarily due to the fact that we paid off our facility b loan on march  see note to our financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
our financial position and liquidity are  and will be  influenced by a variety of factors  including our ability to generate cash flows from operations  the level of any outstanding indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness  our capital expenditure requirements which consist primarily of station construction  lng plant construction costs  rng plant construction costs and the purchase of lng tanker trailers and equipment and any merger or acquisition activity 
sources of cash historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities 
at december  we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  on july   we entered into a loan agreement with chesapeake  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of chesapeake energy corporation  whereby chesapeake agreed to purchase from us up to million aggregate principal amount of debt securities for the development  construction and operation of lng stations pursuant to the issuance of three convertible promissory notes  each having a principal amount of million collectively the chk notes

pursuant to the credit agreement  ge agreed to loan to the borrowers up to an aggregate of million to finance the development  construction and operation of two lng production facilities  each with an expected production capacity of approximately  lng gallons per day 
capital expenditures our business plan calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations  including stations along angh  construction and expansion of our lng plants  expansion and construction of landfill gas processing plants  and the purchase of lng trailers 
we may also elect to invest additional amounts in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries  including rng production 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund any capital expenditures or investments that we cannot fund through available cash or cash generated by operations 
the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend on our rate of new station construction and potential merger or acquisition activity 
we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and may reduce the ability of our business to grow and generate increased revenues 
contractual obligations the following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt and capital lease obligations a operating lease commitments b take or pay lng purchase contracts c construction contracts d dcemb electricity contract e total a consists of long term debt and capital lease obligations to finance acquisitions and equipment purchases  including interest

d consists of our obligations to fund various fueling station construction projects  net of amounts funded through december   and excluding contractual commitments related to station sales contracts 
e consists of our obligations to purchase electricity at our rng plant at the mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements that had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on our financial condition 
outstanding surety bonds for construction contracts and general corporate purposes totaling million  two take or pay contracts for the purchase of lng  operating leases where we are the lessee  operating leases where we are the lessor and owner of the equipment  and firm commitments to sell cng and lng at fixed prices 
we provide surety bonds primarily for construction contracts in the ordinary course of business  as a form of guarantee 
no liability has been recorded in connection with our surety bonds as we do not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements for which we will not be reimbursed 
we have two contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of lng at index based prices 
one contract expires in june and the other contract expires in october we have entered into operating lease arrangements for certain equipment and for our office and field operating locations in the ordinary course of business 
the terms of our leases expire at various dates through additionally  in november  we entered into a ground lease for acres in california on which we built our california lng liquefaction plant 
the lease is for an initial term of thirty years and requires payments of million per year  plus up to million per year for each million gallons of production capacity utilized  subject to future adjustment based on consumer price index changes 
we must also pay a royalty to the landlord for each gallon of lng produced at the facility  as well as a fee for certain other services that the landlord will provide 
we are also the lessor in various leases with our customers  whereby our customers lease certain stations and equipment that we own 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity risk 
we are subject to market risk with respect to our sales of natural gas  which has historically been subject to volatile market conditions 
our exposure to market risk is heightened when we have a fixed price sales contract with a customer that is not covered by a futures contract  or when we are otherwise unable to pass through natural gas price increases to customers 
natural gas prices and availability are affected by many factors  including weather conditions  overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations 
natural gas costs represented or excluding baf  imw and northstar of our cost of sales for and or excluding baf  imw and northstar for to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in natural gas  we may enter into exchange traded natural gas futures contracts 
these arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the other party to the contract defaults on its contract or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the contract and the actual price of natural gas we pay at the delivery point 
we account for these futures contracts in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on derivatives 
the accounting under this guidance for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends upon whether it has been specified in a hedging relationship and  further  on the type of hedging relationship 
to qualify for designation in a hedging relationship  specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained 
the fair value of the futures contracts we use is based on quoted prices in active exchange traded or over the counter markets  which are then discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts applicable to future periods 
the fair value of these futures contracts is continually subject to change due to market conditions 
in an effort to mitigate the volatility in our earnings related to futures activities  our board of directors adopted a revised natural gas hedging policy which restricts our ability to purchase natural gas futures contracts and to offer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
we plan to structure prospective futures contracts so that they will be accounted for as cash flow hedges under the fasb guidance  but we cannot be certain they will qualify 
for more information  please read risk management activities above 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to the futures contracts we hold as of december  to hedge the fixed price component of certain supply contracts 
if the price of natural gas were to fluctuate increase or decrease by from the price quoted on nymex on december  per mcf  we could expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the contracts of approximately million 
foreign exchange rate risk 
because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
since the functional currency of our foreign operations is in their local currency  the currency effects of translating the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries  which operate in local currency environments  are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of consolidated equity and do not impact earnings 
however  foreign currency transaction gains and losses not in our subsidiaries functional currency do impact earnings and resulted in approximately million of gains in during  our primary exposure to foreign currency rates related to our canadian operations that had certain outstanding notes payable denominated in the us dollar which were not hedged 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to our monetary transactions denominated in a foreign currency 
if the exchange rate on these assets and liabilities were to fluctuate by from the rate as of december   we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the assets and liabilities of approximately million
