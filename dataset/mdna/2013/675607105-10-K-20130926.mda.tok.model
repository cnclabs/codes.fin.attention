item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview oconee federal savings and loan association has historically operated as a traditional thrift institution headquartered in seneca  south carolina 
our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits  together with funds generated from operations  in one to four family residential mortgage loans and  to a much lesser extent  non residential mortgage  construction and land and other loans 
we also invest in us government and federal agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
our revenues are derived principally from the interest on loans and securities and loan fees and service charges 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and principal and interest payments on loans and securities 
at june   we had total assets of million  total deposits of million and total equity of million 
a significant majority of our assets consist of long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans and  to a much lesser extent  investment quality securities  which we have funded primarily with deposit accounts and the repayment of existing loans 
we generally do not rely on outside borrowings 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  investment securities including us government and federal agency securities and mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets  primarily interest earning deposits at other financial institutions  and the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of savings and transaction accounts and certificates of deposit 
our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
non interest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and miscellaneous other income 
non interest expense currently consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing  professional and supervisory fees  office expense and other operating expenses 
our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
other than our loans for the construction of one to four family residential mortgage loans  we do not offer interest only mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties where the borrower pays interest for an initial period  after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan 
we also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal  such as option arm loans  where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on his or her loan  resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan 
we do not offer subprime loans loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies  previous charge offs  judgments  bankruptcies  or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt burden ratios or alt a loans generally defined as loans having less than full documentation 
our securities are typically high quality securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or by freddie mac  fannie mae or ginnie mae  all of which are us government sponsored enterprises 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying 
table of contents value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to reflect probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged against income 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of the most critical for us 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses 
as a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
the assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses has two components specific and general allocations 
specific allocations are made for loans that are determined to be impaired 
impairment loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or  for collateral dependent loans  the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses 
the general allocation is determined by segregating classified loans from the remaining loans  and then categorizing each group by type of loan 
loans within each type exhibit common characteristics including terms  collateral type  and other risk characteristics 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we apply loss factors to each category of loan 
we estimate our loss factors taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative aspects that would affect our estimation of probable incurred losses 
these aspects include  but are not limited to historical charge offs  loan delinquencies and foreclosure trends  current economic trends and demographic data within oconee county and the other surrounding areas  such as unemployment rates and population trends  current trends in real estate values within the oconee county market area  charge off trends of other comparable institutions  the results of any internal loan reviews  loan to value ratios  our historically conservative credit risk policy  the strength of our underwriting and ongoing credit monitoring function  and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established  which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
real estate owned valuation 
real estate acquired through loan foreclosure is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
any initial losses at the time of foreclosure 
table of contents are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of these assets are periodically reviewed by management with the carrying value of such assets adjusted through non interest expense to the then estimated fair value  net of estimated selling costs  if lower  until disposition 
fair values of real estate owned are generally based on third party appraisals or other valuations of the property 
business strategy we have focused primarily on improving the execution of our community oriented retail banking strategy 
highlights of our current business strategy include the following continue to focus on residential lending 
we have been and will continue to be primarily a one to four family residential mortgage lender for borrowers in our market area 
as of june   million  or  of our total loan portfolio consisted of one to four family residential mortgage loans including home equity loans 
in the future  we may gradually increase our residential construction and home equity loan portfolios 
maintain a modest portfolio of non residential mortgage loans 
we have historically maintained a small portfolio of non residential mortgage loans  primarily loans to churches located in our market area 
as of june   million  or  of our total loan portfolio  were non residential mortgages or non residential construction and land loans  of which million were loans to churches 
we believe that loans to churches enhance our presence in the community and help expand our financial services business as congregation members become familiar with us 
manage interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing  to the extent practicable  our net interest margin 
subject to market conditions  we have sought to enhance net interest income by emphasizing controls on the cost of funds  particularly on the deposit products that we offer  rather than attempting to maximize asset yields  as loans with high yields often involve greater credit risk and may be repaid during periods of decreasing market interest rates 
in addition  in view of our strong capital position  from time to time  we place more emphasis on enhancing our net interest income than on limiting our interest rate risk 
rely on community orientation and high quality service to maintain and build a loyal local customer base and maintain our status as an independent community based institution 
we were established in and have been operating continuously in oconee county since that time 
by using our recognized brand name and the goodwill developed over years of providing timely  efficient banking services  we have been able to attract a solid base of local retail customers on which to continue to build our banking business 
we have historically focused on promoting relationships within our community rather than specific banking products  and we expect to continue to build our customer base by relying on customer referrals and referrals from local builders and realtors 
adhere to conservative underwriting guidelines to maintain strong asset quality 
we have emphasized maintaining strong asset quality by following conservative underwriting guidelines  sound loan administration  and focusing on loans secured by real estate located within our market area only 
our non performing assets and troubled debt restructurings totaled million  or of total assets at june  our total nonperforming loans to total loans ratio was at june  total loan delinquencies  days or more past due  as of june   were million  or of total loans 
comparison of financial condition at june  and june  our total assets decreased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in total assets of million was largely due to the 
table of contents repurchase of million of shares of common stock during the year ended june  coupled with a decrease in our total deposits of thousand 
these decreases and the purchase of million of bank owned life insurance during the year resulted in a decrease of total cash and cash equivalents of million at june  total net loans decreased million  or  to million at june   offset partially by an increase in securities available for sale of million  or  to million at june  from million at june  as we continued to redeploy funds from loan repayments to purchase high quality investments primarily bonds issued by government sponsored enterprises 
loans continued to decrease due to lower demand for our loan products and increased competition from other lenders in our market area offering lower fixed rate mortgage products during this period of very low mortgage rates 
deposits decreased modestly by thousand  or  to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in deposits reflected a decrease in certificates of deposit of million  or  offset partially by an increase in now  money market and regular savings accounts of million  or 
the declining interest rate environment has slowed overall deposit growth  particularly in certificates of deposit  which historically have yielded higher rates 
we generally do not accept brokered deposits  and no brokered deposits were accepted during the months ended june  we had no advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta as of june  and we have credit available under a loan agreement with the federal home loan bank of atlanta in the amount of of total assets  or approximately million at june  total equity decreased million  or  to million at june   compared with million at june  the decrease resulted from the repurchase of million of shares of our common stock during the year ended june   payment of dividends of million  and a change in accumulated other comprehensive income of million  which was offset partially by net income of million 
comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and june  general 
net income remained relatively the same at million for the years ended june  and net interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased thousand  or   to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  noninterest income remained relatively unchanged at thousand for the year ended june  as compared with thousand for the year ended june  total noninterest expenses decreased thousand  or  to million for the year ended june  from million at june  interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was the result of both a decrease in the average yield on earnings assets to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june   and a decrease in the average balances of interest earning assets to million from million for the same periods 
the decline in the average balances of interest earning assets is primarily a reflection of the decline in average loans due to the decline in demand in our market area 
interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june   reflecting shrinking loan demand 
the average balance of loans decreased million  or to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the yield on loans declined by basis points to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  interest income on investment securities increased thousand  or  to million for the year ended june  from thousand for the year ended june   reflecting an increase 
table of contents of million  or  in the average balances of securities to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively  which offset the basis point decrease in the yield on such securities to at june  from at june  interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease reflected a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on deposits in fiscal year to from in fiscal year  which more than offset the slight increase in the average balance of such deposits 
interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased thousand  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit reflected a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of certificates of deposit to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  and a decrease of basis points in the average cost on certificates of deposit to from for the same periods ended 
interest expense on money market deposits  now and demand deposits  and regular savings and other deposits decreased by thousand to thousand for the year ended june  from thousand for the year ended june  the decrease was due to the decrease of basis points in the yield on such deposits to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  the decrease in yields more than offset the increase in the average balance of these deposits by million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  net interest income 
net interest income decreased thousand  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease of basis points reflected the decrease in our net interest margin to for the year ended june  from at june  the decrease in net interest margin more than offset the basis point increase in our interest rate spread to from 
our ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to x for the year ended june  from x for the year ended provision for loan losses 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of thousand for the year ended june   compared with a provision for loan losses of thousand for the year ended june  the slight decrease in the provision for loan losses reflected a decrease in our total impaired loans to million at june  from million at june  and a decrease in our total loan portfolio 
impaired loans consist of all of our nonperforming loans and any other loans evidencing credit deterioration such that the likelihood of not receiving all contractual principal and interest payments is probable 
the amount of impairment or specific portion of our allowance on impaired loans at june  was thousand as compared with thousand at june  the decrease in the amount of impaired loans and related impairment coupled with the decline in the balance of our loan portfolio of million for the year ended june  resulted in a smaller provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses was thousand  or of total loans  at june   compared with thousand  or  of total loans  at june  real estate owned was million at june   compared with thousand at june   an increase of thousand 
although there was a slight increase in total real estate owned at june   total real estate owned is made up of only single family residences 
we used the same methodology in assessing the allowances for both periods ended 
our allowance at june  reflects both a general valuation component of thousand and a specific component of thousand for loans determined to be impaired based upon an analysis of certain individual loans determined to be impaired 
in comparison  our allowance at june  consisted of a general valuation component of thousand and a specific component of thousand 
the decrease in both the general valuation component and the specific component at june  is both a result in improvements in our loan credit quality and a decline in the balance of our outstanding 
table of contents loans 
individually impaired loans were evaluated using the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral 
we did not record a specific allowance for loans where the fair value of the collateral was in excess of the outstanding principal of the loan 
to the best of our knowledge  we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable for the years ended june  and noninterest income 
noninterest income remained relatively the same for both years ended june  and at thousand and thousand  respectively 
the increase of thousand in income on bank owned life insurance is related to the purchase of million of new bank owned life insurance in late april of the increase in bank owned life insurance income was offset partially by decreases in gains of sales of real estate owned and gains on sales of securities of thousand and thousand  respectively  for the year ended june  other noninterest income of thousand is primarily composed of thousand of gain recognized on foreclosure of certain loans whereby the estimated fair value of the real estate collateral exceeded the carrying value of the foreclosed loans 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense decreased thousand  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in noninterest expenses was primarily related to a decrease in the provision for real estate owned and related expenses of thousand  or  to thousand for the year ended june  from thousand and to a lesser extent by decreases in data processing expenses of thousand and fdic deposit insurance expense of thousand 
these decreases more than offset the increase in salaries and employee benefits of thousand 
approximately thousand of the increase in salaries and employee benefits is related to the increase in esop expense and expense associated with our equity incentive plans 
esop expense increased thousand  or  to thousand for the year ended june  from thousand for the year ended june   which was primarily a result of increases in our stock prices during the year ended used in determining compensation expense for esop shares earned 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended june  was thousand compared with thousand for the year ended june  the reason was due to the fact that we did not recognize a full year expense related to our equity incentive plans during the year ended june  because the initial grant of options and awards under the equity incentive plans occurred in the third quarter of that fiscal year and expenses associated with options and awards are recognized ratably over the vesting period 
the remaining portion of the increase is related to the addition of a new banking officer to serve as the company controller and pay increases of approximately for each employee 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million for year ended june  compared with million at june  our effective tax rates for the years ended june  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rates is primarily related to the increase income from bank owned life insurance  which is not taxable for income tax purposes 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the income we earn on interest earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income also depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
the following tables set forth average balance sheets  average yields and costs  and certain other information at the dates and for the periods indicated 
all average balances are daily average balances 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances  but have been reflected in the

for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate 
year ended compared to volume rate net dollars in thousands interest income loans investment securities other interest earning assets total interest expense deposits total increase decrease in net interest income year ended compared to volume rate net dollars in thousands interest income loans investment securities other interest earning assets total interest expense deposits total increase decrease in net interest income management of market risk our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because  as a financial institution  the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
therefore  a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
our board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our asset liability strategies 
the asset liability committee of our board of directors meets monthly and is charged with developing an asset liability management plan 
our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee  consisting of senior management  which meets daily to review pricing and liquidity needs and to assess our interest rate risk 
this committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by our board of directors 

table of contents the techniques we are currently using to manage interest rate risk include using pricing strategies in an effort to balance the proportions of year and year fixed rate loans in our portfolio  maintaining a modest portfolio of adjustable rate one to four family residential loans  funding a portion of our operations with deposits with terms greater than one year  focusing our business operations on local retail customers who value our community orientation and personal service and who may be somewhat less sensitive to interest rate changes than wholesale deposit customers  and maintaining a strong capital position  which provides for a favorable level of interest earning assets relative to interest bearing liabilities 
depending on market conditions  from time to time we place more emphasis on enhancing net interest margin rather than matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
in particular  we believe that the increased net interest income resulting from a mismatch in the maturity of our assets and liabilities portfolios can  during periods of stable or declining interest rates  provide high enough returns to justify increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates 
as a result of this philosophy  our results of operations and the economic value of our equity will remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to declines due to the difference between long and short term interest rates 
an important measure of interest rate risk is the amount by which the net present value of npv an institution cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items changes in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
we have prepared an analysis of estimated changes in our npv under the assumed instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
the financial model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of the npv 
set forth below is an analysis of the changes to the economic value of our equity as of june  in the event of designated changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
at june   our npv exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines we have established 
net portfolio value per model dollar change from base percentage change from base percentage total of market value of assets dollars in thousands up basis points up basis points up basis points base down basis points certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value table presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
in addition  this the net portfolio value table does not reflect the impact of a change in interest rates on the credit quality of our assets 
accordingly  although the net portfolio value table provides an indication of our interest 
table of contents rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results 
our policies generally do not permit us to engage in derivative transactions  such as futures  options  caps  floors or swap transactions  however  such transactions may be entered into with the prior approval of the asset liability management committee or the board of directors for hedging purposes only 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits and the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive within our market and to increase core deposit relationships 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  net cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of our net income 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  net cash flows used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of investment securities  offset by proceeds from maturities and paydowns on investment securities  and net loan repayments 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  net cash flows used in financing activities consisted primarily of the payment of dividends and share repurchases of our common stock 
the increase of million is primarily related to the million of share repurchases for the year ended june  our most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at june  and  cash and short term investments totaled million and million  respectively 
we may also utilize as sources of funds the sale of securities available for sale  federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank of atlanta advances and other borrowings 
at june  and  we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and thousand  respectively 
we had no unfunded commitments under lines of credit or standby letters of credit at june  and we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan commitments 
in recent periods  loan commitments have been funded through liquidity and normal deposit flows 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less from june  totaled million 
management believes based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
based on the foregoing  in addition to our level of core deposits and capital  we consider our liquidity and capital resources sufficient to meet our outstanding short term and long term needs 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term responsibility of management 
we adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon management assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and investment securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning overnight deposits and federal funds sold 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  we have additional borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
at june   we had an available borrowing limit of million in advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements new capital rules  holding company regulation capital 
at june   we were in compliance with all applicable capital 
table of contents requirements 
beginning in  we will be subject to additional capital requirements under capital regulations recently adopted by our regulators 
see supervision and regulation federal banking regulation capital requirements and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
common stock dividend policy 
the company paid a quarterly per share dividend on august   november   february   and may  for a total of million in dividends paid during the year ended june  on july   the board of directors of the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of the company common stock payable to stockholders of record as of august   which was paid on august  off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
for the fiscal year ended june   we did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions other than loan origination commitments in the normal course of our lending activities 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates  generally  have a more significant impact on a financial institution performance than does inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
