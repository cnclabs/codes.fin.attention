item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the information set forth in selected financial data and our financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon our current expectations  estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements due to  among other considerations  the matters discussed under risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading provider of startpages  tv everywhere solutions  identity management idm and various cloud based services across multiple devices for cable  satellite  telecom and consumer electronics companies 
we are also a leading provider of authentication and aggregation solutions for delivery of online content 
our technology allows our customers to package a wide array of online content and cloud based services with their high speed internet  communications  television and other offerings 
our customers offer our services under their own brands on internet enabled devices such as pcs  tablets  smartphones and connected tvs 
we generate revenue from search and display advertising and by charging subscriber based fees for services and products delivered through our startpages 
our results are driven primarily by our customer mix  the product and service mix preferences of those customers and the pricing of those products and services 
we generate the majority of our revenue from search and display advertising on our startpages  which comprise consumer facing components of our technology 
adding new customers with large consumer bases and expansion of our relationships with existing customers have resulted in an increasing shift in our revenue mix towards search and display advertising revenue 
in addition  as new customers adopt our solutions  and as their respective consumers use of our startpages ramps up as described below  our growth is increasingly driven by search and display advertising revenue 
these increases are largely driven by our model of sharing a portion of this search and advertising revenue with our customers 
as we expand our value added services offerings  we expect to generate increased subscriber based revenue from our customers 
growth in search and display advertising revenue is driven largely by increasing consumer use of our startpages 
as more consumers use our startpages and as consumers spend more time on these startpages  we have a greater number of opportunities to deliver advertisements 
during the year ended december   search and display advertising revenue was million  a growth of over million for the year ended december  over the same period  our unique visitors increased by  our search queries increased by and our advertising impressions increased by 
we expect future growth in consumer engagement as our customers deliver more services through our cross device  touchscreen enabled startpages 
our subscriber based revenue consists of fees charged for the use of our proprietary technology and for the use of  or access to  services  such as e mail  security  tv everywhere  online games  music and other value added services and paid content 
during the year ended december   subscriber based revenue was million  an increase of from million during the year ended december  we believe there are opportunities to generate new sources of subscriber based revenue  such as the introduction of new value added services  including those delivered on cross device  touchscreen enabled devices 
we believe that the variety of value added services and the introduction of new value added services will also drive increased search and display advertising revenue 
as new customers introduce our startpages to their consumers  usage of our solutions and our revenue from our startpages tends to increase over time 
there are a variety of reasons for this ramp up period 
for example  a new customer may migrate its consumers from its existing technology to our technology over a period of time 
moreover  a new customer may initially launch a selection of our services and products  rather than our entire suite of offerings  and subsequently broaden their service and product offerings over time 
when a customer launches a new service or product  marketing and promotional activities may be required to generate awareness and interest among consumers 
search and display advertising revenue typically grows significantly during the first one to three years after a customer launch  although there can be notable variances from customer to customer 
thereafter  changes in revenue tend to mirror changes in the consumer base of the applicable customer 
for the year ended december   we derived revenue from over customers  with revenue attributable to four customers  centurylink including revenue attributable to qwest  charter  verizon and toshiba  together accounting for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   or million 
one of these customers accounted 
table of contents for or more of revenue in such period  and revenue attributable to each of the other three customers accounted for more than in such period 
revenue attributable to our customers includes the subscriber based revenue earned directly from them  as well as the search and display advertising revenue generated through our relationships with our search and display advertising partners such as google for search advertising and advertising networks  advertising agencies and advertisers for display advertising 
this revenue is attributable to our customers because it is produced from the traffic on our startpages 
these partners provide us with advertisements that we then deliver with search results and other content on our startpages 
since our search advertising partner  google  and our advertising network partners generate their revenue by selling those advertisements  we create a revenue stream for these partners 
in the year ended december   search advertising through our relationship with google generated approximately of our revenue  or million all of which was attributable to our customers 
we have experienced and expect in the future to experience growth in our business as we acquire new customers  as our existing customers acquire new consumers  as we roll out new products and services and as we expand our presence into international markets 
we expect to continue to make capital expenditures in related to both the customer supporting activities and our internal information technology infrastructure 
we expect in that our research and development headcount and associated expenses will be relatively consistent with the run rate of the fourth quarter of  as we continue to develop our technology  deliver new products and services  and make those and existing products and services available across different devices 
although we experienced net losses in as well as in prior years  we believe that the revenue opportunities afforded us by the growth in search and display advertising across our customers have enhanced our ability to achieve profitability in the future 
our costs of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  are expected to remain relatively consistent as most of these costs are associated with the sharing of revenue with our customers 
we expect our operating expenses  as a percentage of revenue  in to be consistent with the initiatives described below under key initiatives are expected to contribute to our ability to maintain and grow profitability via increases in advertising revenue  increases in customers and our consumer reach  and increases in availability of products across more devices 
we expect the period in which we experience a return on future investments in each of these initiatives to differ 
for example  more direct advertising at higher cpms would be expected to have an immediate and direct impact on profitability while expansion into international markets may require an investment that involves a longer term return 
we expect that some of the net proceeds of our initial public offering will be utilized with a goal of enhancing our technology and our systems capabilities to more efficiently support our customers  develop new products and features and report upon  analyze and manage the financial performance of the business in order to improve our ability to achieve consistent profitability in the future 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have not yet determined the specific uses of the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
trends affecting our business our customers  who are predominantly high speed internet service providers that also offer television services  are facing increasing competition from companies that deliver video content over the internet  more commonly referred to as over the top  or ott 
these new competitors include a number of large and growing companies  such as google  netflix  inc  or netflix  hulu  llc  or hulu  and amazon 
com inc  or amazon 
with the increased availability of high speed internet access and over the top programming  consumers video content consumption preferences may shift away from current viewing habits 
as a result  many of our customers and potential customers are compelled to find new ways to deliver services and content to their consumers via the internet 
we expect this pressure to become even greater as more video content becomes available online 
we expect to continue to benefit from this trend as customers adopt our solutions to package and deliver video programming and other related authentication services on our startpages 
another trend affecting our customers and our business is the proliferation of internet connected devices  especially mobile devices 
smartphones  tablets and connected tvs have made it more convenient for consumers to access services and content online  including television programming 
to remain competitive  our customers and potential customers must have the capability to deliver their services and products to consumers on these new devices 
our technology enables them to extend their presence beyond traditional personal computers  and we expect that some portion of our revenue growth will come from traffic on these devices 
our business is also affected by growth in advertising on the internet  of which proliferation of high speed internet access and internet connected devices will be the principal drivers 
we believe such search advertising will continue to attract advertising spending to the internet and will benefit our results of operations 
also  we expect our results of operations will benefit from the growth in the number of mobile internet users as our customers adopt our cross device  touchscreen enabled startpages 

table of contents the launch of the microsoft windows operating system in october has had an impact on our business 
as it relates to our business with consumer electronics customers that have the windows operating system pre installed on their laptop or desktop computers  our startpages are now placed on a second tab when the internet browser is launched 
this has caused us to reduce our revenue expectations from our consumer electronics customers 
key initiatives we are focused on several key initiatives to drive our business add new  and expand our existing offerings with current  cable  telecom  satellite and consumer electronics customers to increase our consumer reach  continue to expand our offerings of  and invest in  cloud based services such as e mail and tv everywhere and increase the number of customers using our tv everywhere technology  enhance our direct advertising sales effort to increase the cpms derived from advertising  extend the availability of our existing and new products and services to additional devices including tablets and smartphones  expand our presence into international markets  and invest in and acquire new technologies and products 
key business metrics in addition to the line items in our financial statements  we regularly review a number of business metrics related to internet traffic and search and display advertising to evaluate our business  determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies 
we believe disclosing these metrics is useful for investors and analysts to understand the underlying trends in our business 
the following table summarizes our key business metrics  which are unaudited  for the years ended december   and year ended december  key business metrics unique visitors search queries advertising impressions notes reflects the number of unique visitors to our startpages computed on an average monthly basis during the applicable period 
reflects the total number of search queries during the applicable period 
reflects the total number of advertising impressions during the applicable period 
unique visitors we define unique visitors as consumers who have visited one of our startpages at least once during a particular time period 
we rely on comscore to provide this data 
comscore estimates this data based on the us portion of the internet activity of its worldwide panel of consumers and its proprietary data collection method 
search queries we define search queries as the number of instances in which a consumer entered a query into a search bar on our startpages during a particular time period 
we rely on reports from our search partner  google  to measure the number of such instances 

table of contents advertising impressions we define advertising impressions as graphical  textual or video paid advertisements displayed to consumers on our startpages during a particular time period 
we rely on reports from technology and advertising partners  including doubleclick a division of google  to measure the number of advertising impressions delivered on our platform 
components of our results of operations revenue we derive our revenue from two categories revenue generated from search and display advertising activities and subscriber based revenue  each of which is described below 
we record our search and display advertising revenue on a gross basis  which includes the net amount received from google under our agreement with them 
the following table shows the revenue in each category  both in amount and as a percentage of revenue  for  and year ended december  in thousands revenue search and display advertising subscriber based total revenue percentage of revenue search and display advertising subscriber based total revenue search and display advertising revenue we use internet search and display advertising to generate revenue from the traffic on our startpages 
in the case of search advertising  we have a revenue sharing relationship with google  pursuant to which we include a google branded search tool on our startpages 
when a consumer makes a search query using this tool  we deliver the query to google and they return search results to consumers that include advertiser sponsored links 
if the consumer clicks on a sponsored link  google receives payment from the sponsor of that link and shares a portion of that payment with us  which we in turn share with the applicable customer 
the net payment we receive from google is recognized as revenue 
we generate display advertising revenue when consumers view or click on a text  graphic or video advertisement that was delivered on a synacor operated startpage 
we fill our advertising inventory with advertisements sourced by our direct salesforce  independent advertising sales representatives and advertising network partners 
revenue may be calculated differently depending on our agreements with our advertisers or the agreements between our advertising network partners and their advertisers 
it may be calculated on a cost per impression basis  which means the advertiser pays based on the number of times its advertisements appear  or a cost per action basis  which means that an advertiser pays when a consumer performs an action after engaging one of its advertisements 
historically only a small percentage of our display advertising revenue has been calculated on a cost per action basis 
subscriber based revenue we define subscriber based revenue as subscription fees and other fees that we receive from our customers for the use of our proprietary technology and the use of  or access to  e mail  security  tv everywhere  games and other services  including value added services and paid content 
monthly subscriber levels typically form the basis for calculating and generating subscriber based revenue 
they are generally determined by multiplying a per subscriber per month fee by the number of subscribers using the particular services being offered or consumed 
in other cases  the fee is fixed 
we recognize revenue from our customers as the service is delivered 

table of contents costs and expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of revenue sharing  content acquisition costs and co location facility costs 
revenue sharing consists of amounts accrued and paid to our customers for the traffic on our startpage resulting in the generation of search and display advertising revenue 
the revenue sharing agreements with our customers are primarily variable payments based on a percentage of the search and display advertising revenue 
content acquisition agreements may be based on a fixed payment schedule  on the number of subscribers per month  or a combination of both 
fixed payment agreements are expensed over the term defined in the agreement 
agreements based on the number of subscribers are expensed on a monthly basis 
co location facility costs consist of rent and operating costs for our data center facilities 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses incurred for the development of  enhancements to  and maintenance and operation of our technology and related infrastructure 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses to our direct sales and marketing personnel  as well as costs related to advertising  industry conferences  promotional materials  and other sales and marketing programs 
advertising cost is expensed as incurred 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses for executive management  finance  accounting  human resources and other administrative functions 
depreciation depreciation includes depreciation of our computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements  and other property  and depreciation on capital leased assets 
other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income earned and foreign exchange gains and losses 
interest expense interest expense primarily consists of expenses associated with our long term debt  capital leases  and amortization of debt issuance costs 
provision for income taxes income tax expense consists of federal and state income taxes in the united states and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
see note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to the financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions  and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments  or conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the terms of our arrangements with our customers  google and our advertising network partners are specified in written agreements 
these written agreements constitute the persuasive evidence of the arrangements with our customers that are a pre condition to the recognition of revenue 
the evidence used to document that delivery or performance has occurred generally consists of communication of either numbers of subscribers or the revenue generated in a reporting period from customers  advertising partners  vendors and our own internally generated reports 
occasionally  a customer will notify us of subsequent adjustments to previously reported subscriber data 
these adjustments  once accepted by us  will result in adjustments to revenue and cost of revenue 
the historical occurrences of such adjustments  and the amounts involved  have not been significant 
although prices used in our revenue recognition formulas are generally fixed pursuant to the written arrangements with our customers  google and our advertising network partners  the number of subscribers or the amount of search and display advertising revenue that are subject to our pricing arrangements are not known until the reporting period has ended 
although this data is  in most cases  available prior to the completion of our periodic financial statements  this data may need to be estimated 
when made  these estimates are based upon our historical experience with the relevant party 
adjustments to these estimates have historically not been significant 
the receipt of this volume data also serves to verify that we have appropriately satisfied our obligation to our customers for that reporting period 
adjustments are recorded in the period in which the data is received 
pursuant to the terms of our customer contracts  we recognize revenue in each period for our services once the contract has been signed  its terms reviewed and understood  the service  content or both have been made available to the customer and reliable active subscriber information is made available to us 
we undertake an evaluation of the creditworthiness of both new and  on a periodic basis  existing customers 
based on these reviews we determine whether collection of our prospective revenue is probable 
revenue sharing we pay our customers a portion of the revenue generated from search and display advertising 
the portion paid to our customers depends on  among other things  the consumer base of the customer and their expected ability to drive consumer traffic to our startpages 
this revenue consists of the consideration we receive from google and our display advertising partners in connection with traffic supplied by the applicable customer 
gross versus net presentation of revenue for revenue sharing we evaluate our relationship between our search and display advertising partners and our customers in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc   principal agent considerations 
we have determined that the revenue derived from traffic supplied by our customers is reported on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor we are responsible to our customers for fulfilling search and display advertising services and value added and other services  are involved in the service specifications  perform part of the service  have discretion in supplier selection  have latitude in establishing price and bear credit risk 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance  stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the respective award 
as a result  we are required to estimate the amount of stock based compensation we expect to be forfeited based on our historical experience 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the fair value of our common stock  our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options  stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends  which are estimated as follows 
table of contents fair value of our common stock 
because our stock was not publicly traded prior to our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors based on valuations prepared by an independent valuation specialist 
the board of directors intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant 
following the completion of our initial public offering in february  our common stock has been valued by reference to its publicly traded price 
expected term 
the expected term was estimated using the simplified method allowed under sec guidance 
as we develop more experience  our estimate of the life of awards may change 
volatility 
as we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock  the expected stock price volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants 
industry peers consist of several public companies in the technology industry similar in size  stage of life cycle and financial leverage 
we did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low 
we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available  or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us  in which case  more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation 
risk free rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yields of us treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group 
dividend yield 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we used an expected dividend yield of zero 
income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we also provide reserves as necessary for uncertain tax positions taken on our tax filings 
first  we determine if a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit solely based on technical merits  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  based on the largest amount of benefit  which is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement we recognize any such differences as a liability 
in the event that any unrecognized tax benefits are recognized  the effective tax rate will be affected 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will be the same as these estimates 
these estimates are updated quarterly based on factors such as change in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  new audit activity  and effectively settled issues 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required 
future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and or tax planning strategies 
should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed

due to the uncertainty at december  to generate sufficient taxable income in the future and utilize the nols before they expire  we had recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to zero 
consequently  we did not record any material income tax expense in in the fourth quarter of  as a result of weighing the positive and negative evidence we determined that we would more likely than not be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future and would be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards

to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  cash from short term borrowings and the net proceeds from our initial public offering are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
in connection with our initial public offering in february  we received aggregate gross proceeds of million 
the net proceeds to synacor from the offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts of million and offering costs of million 
in july we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with a commercial bank 
as of december   there was no outstanding principal amount of term loan debt 
the amended and restated loan and security agreement also provides us with a revolving credit line of million  which we can draw on at any time before july  subject to a borrowing base calculation 
borrowings under the revolving credit line accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus  subject to a minimum rate of per annum  and must be repaid by july as of december   million was fully available under the revolving credit line  with no outstanding borrowings

changes in our operating assets and liabilities provided million of cash  primarily due to an increase of our accounts payable of million and an increase of our accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million  partially offset by increases in our accounts receivable of million 
the increase in our accounts payable was attributable to a million increase due to the timing of  and a change in payment terms with  a customer for their revenue share payment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations both within the united states and internationally  and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these primarily include interest rate and inflation risk 
interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash and money market funds 
we currently have no investments of any type 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited because nearly all of our cash and cash equivalents have a short term maturity and are used primarily for working capital purposes 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
