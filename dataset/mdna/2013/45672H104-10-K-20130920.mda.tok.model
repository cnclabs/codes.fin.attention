the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in the course of operating our business  we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices  the collection of receivables  the manufacturing and shipment of products  the fulfillment of orders  the purchase of supplies  and the building of inventory and spare parts  among other matters 
each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period

table of contents business overview we are a leader in automated network control and provide an appliance based solution that enables dynamic networks and next generation data centers 
our solution combines real time ip address management with the automation of key network control and network change and configuration management processes in purpose built physical and virtual appliances 
it is based on our proprietary software that is highly scalable and automates vital network functions  such as ip address management  device configuration  compliance  network discovery  policy implementation  security and monitoring 
our solution enables our end customers to create dynamic networks  address burgeoning growth in the number of network connected devices and applications  manage complex networks efficiently and capture more fully the value from virtualization and cloud computing 
our physical appliances are built by third party manufacturers and primarily utilize readily available components 
our virtual appliances are designed to approximate their physical counterparts in functionality  scalability and performance and currently operate in vmware and microsoft virtual environments and are integrated within certain third party products 
we derive revenue from sales and licensing of our products and sales of our services 
we generate products and licenses revenue primarily from sales of perpetual licenses to our software installed on our physical and virtual appliances 
we generate services revenue primarily from sales of maintenance and support and  to a lesser extent  from sales of training and consulting services 
end customers typically purchase maintenance and support in conjunction with purchases of our products  and generally renew their maintenance and support contracts upon expiration 
maintenance and support provide a significant source of recurring revenue for us 
in  and  services revenue was  and of our net revenue in the respective years 
we sell our products and services to enterprises and government entities primarily through our channel partners  including distributors  systems integrators  managed service providers and value added resellers in the united states and internationally 
we also have a field sales force that sells our solution directly to certain end customers  and typically works closely with our channel partners in all phases of initial sales of our products and services 
our results of operations have benefited from the increasing complexity of networks  including increasing numbers of connected devices and applications  expanding use of technologies  such as virtualization  cloud computing and adoption of ipv  which we believe is straining legacy network control approaches and driving organizations to replace their legacy approaches to network control with automated network control solutions 
accordingly  we expect that our future business and operating results will be significantly affected by the speed with which organizations transition to automated network control solutions 
our future business and operating results will depend both on our ability to add new end customers continually and to continue to sell additional products and services to our growing base of existing customers directly and through our channel partners 
since our prior results have benefitted from our success at selling more complex and higher performance configurations of our product solutions  which generally result in higher value per product sold  we expect that our ability to sell more robust product configurations will be an important factor in sustaining our revenue growth rates and our operating results in any quarter 
to achieve the foregoing objectives  we intend to continue to invest for long term growth by  among other things  expanding our field sales force  our channel and technology partnerships and our programs to market our solutions 
in addition  we expect to continue to invest in research and development and selective acquisitions in order to expand the capabilities of our solutions 
we expect that our operating results will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments over the next few quarters 

table of contents financial highlights fiscal was a year of strong execution and significant growth for us with significant increases in revenue across all of our major geographic regions and industry verticals 
we achieved annual revenue growth and product revenue growth  in spite of a challenging it spending environment 
from a geographic perspective  we experienced revenue growth of in the americas  in emea and in apac 
we also delivered solid operating profitability and generated operating cash flows of million while investing significantly in the business 
we exited fiscal with approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and over million of total deferred net revenue 
in fiscal  we saw strong customer adoption of our automated network control solutions as their requirements for network reliability  security and manageability have increased at a rapid pace 
we also expanded our total addressable market by introducing new security solutions and the trinzic  a new smaller form factor network edge appliance 
fiscal was also our first full year as a public company  following our initial public offering in april we believe the greater visibility and brand recognition derived from being a public company combined with the increasing awareness of end customers to the value and relevance of our products to their networks have served as important contributors to our growth 
in fiscal  we continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position and we believe continued product innovation has strengthened our technology advantage and resulted in market share gains 
we also made a significant investment in sales and marketing to grow our global sales force and distribution channels to extend our global presence both geographically and by industry segment 
in fiscal  total operating expenses increased by compared to fiscal the increase was primarily driven by additional headcount to support our growth as we continued to invest in the development of new products and expand our sales coverage 
as a percentage of revenue  total operating expenses declined from to  which together with a slight improvement in gross margin contributed to improved profitability for fiscal 
table of contents key metrics of our business we monitor a variety of key financial metrics to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies 
these key financial metrics include the following year ended july  dollars in thousands net revenue deferred revenue  net end of year change in deferred revenue  net gross margin loss from operations operating margin net cash provided by operating activities net revenue 
we monitor our net revenue to assess the acceptance of our products by our end customers and our growth in the markets we serve 
we discuss our net revenue further below under results of operations 
deferred revenue  net 
our deferred revenue  net consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue  less the related cost of revenue 
the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from maintenance and support contracts 
we also generally defer revenue on sales of products to a distributor until that distributor reports to us that it has sold the product to an end customer 
we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of the revenue that we will recognize in future periods 
we also assess the change in our deferred revenue balance  which taken together with net revenue is an indication of sales activity in a given period 
gross margin 
we monitor our gross margin to assess the impact on our current and forecasted financial results of any changes to the pricing and mix of products that we are selling to our end customers 
we discuss our gross margin further below under results of operations 
income loss from operations and operating margin 
we monitor our income loss from operations and operating margin to assess how effectively we are conducting our operations as well as controlling our operating expenses  which are primarily driven by headcount 
we discuss our operating expenses further below under results of operations 
net cash provided by operating activities 
we monitor cash flow provided by operations as a measure of our overall business performance 
our cash provided by operating activities is driven primarily by sales of our products and licenses and  to a lesser extent  by up front payments from end customers under maintenance and support contracts 
our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  costs of acquiring the hardware for our appliances  marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities 
monitoring cash provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the effects of certain non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation  thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business 
we discuss the components of cash provided by operating activities further below under liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents non gaap financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap  including non gaap gross profit and gross margin  non gaap income from operations and operating margin and non gaap net income and non gaap diluted net income per share 
these non gaap financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
our non gaap financial measures are described as follows non gaap gross profit and gross margin 
non gaap gross profit is gross profit as reported on our consolidated statements of operations  excluding the impact of stock based compensation  intangible asset amortization expense  and acquisition related expenses 
non gaap gross margin is non gaap gross profit divided by net revenue 
non gaap income from operations and operating margin 
non gaap income from operations is income loss from operations as reported on our consolidated statements of operations  excluding the impact of stock based compensation  intangible asset amortization expense  and acquisition related expenses 
non gaap operating margin is non gaap operating income divided by net revenue 
non gaap net income and earnings per share eps 
non gaap net income is net income loss as reported on our consolidated statements of operations  excluding the impact of stock based compensation  intangible asset amortization expense  acquisition related expenses and the tax impact of these adjustments 
non gaap eps is non gaap net income divided by non gaap diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
for fiscal and  non gaap diluted weighted average shares outstanding was computed to give effect to the conversion of all outstanding convertible preferred stock including the exercise of related preferred stock warrants and the exercise of certain common stock warrants which occurred upon the closing of our ipo on april   as if conversion or exercise had occurred at the beginning of the period of issuance

furthermore  we use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance 
we also believe that these non gaap financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry  many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non gaap financial measures rather than the nearest gaap equivalent of these financial measures 
first  these non gaap financial measures exclude certain recurring  non cash charges such as stock based compensation and intangible asset amortization expense 
stock based compensation has been  and will continue to be for the foreseeable future  a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees compensation that affects their performance 
second  the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these non gaap financial measures may differ from the expenses  if any  that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations 
we compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest gaap equivalents of these non gaap financial measures and describing these gaap equivalents under results of operations below

in  cash used in investing activities was million  consisting of million for purchases of computer equipment and software and an increase of million in restricted cash related to the standby letter of credit we are required to maintain under an operating lease for our new corporate headquarters 
in  cash used in investing activities was million  consisting of million in purchases of computer equipment  software and leasehold improvements  million for the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of a company formerly named solsoft sa from loglogic  inc and million for the purchase of patents from avaya  inc cash flows from financing activities in  cash provided by financing activities was million  which primarily related to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
in  we generated million in net proceeds from our ipo 
with the exception of our ipo  our financing activities have consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options that amounted to million 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million resulting from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits from employee stock option plans 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations  as of july  we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash and cash equivalents balances 
payments due by period total and thereafter in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments total the contractual obligation table excludes tax liabilities of million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement  if any  of these future payments 
operating lease obligations represent our obligations to make payments under non cancelable lease agreements for our facilities 
purchase commitments are contractual obligations to purchase inventory from our third party manufacturers in advance of anticipated sales 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 

table of contents the critical accounting estimates  assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition we design  develop and sell a broad family of network products and services to automate management of the critical network infrastructure services needed for secure  scalable and fault tolerant connections between applications  devices and users 
our software products are typically sold for use with our hardware  but we also have virtual versions that we sell for use with other hardware environments 
we derive revenue from two sources i products and licenses  which include hardware and software revenue  and ii services  which include maintenance and support  training and consulting revenue 
the majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  the software sold with our hardware appliances are considered non software deliverables and have been removed from the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of stand alone software products that can be deployed on our hardware or that of other vendors 
stand alone software may operate on our hardware appliance  but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware 
stand alone software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software and maintenance and support 
stand alone software sales continue to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we define each of those four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor or value added reseller agreement or  in limited cases  an end user agreement 
delivery or performance has occurred 
we use shipping and related documents  distributor sell through reports  or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery or performance 
we do not recognize product revenue until transfer of title and risk of loss  which generally is upon shipment to value added resellers or end users 
the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection on a customer by customer basis 
we subject our customers to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for our products and services 
if we conclude that collection is not probable  we do not recognize revenue until cash is received 
services revenue includes maintenance and support  training and consulting revenue 
maintenance and support revenue includes arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for our products and licenses 
maintenance is offered under renewable  fee based contracts  which include hour technical support  hardware repair and replacement parts  bug fixes  patches and unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
revenue from customer maintenance and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period  generally one to three years 
revenue from consulting and training is recognized as the services are completed  which is generally one year or less 

table of contents we operate a multiple tier channel distribution model that includes distributors  value added resellers and direct sales to end customers 
for sales to value added resellers and end customers  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end customer prior to shipment to a value added reseller 
for the end customers and value added resellers  we generally have no significant contractual obligations for future performance  such as rights of return or pricing credits 
however  we may on occasion enter into arrangements with end customers or value added resellers that include some form of rights of return  rebates or price protection 
also  we may occasionally accept returns by end customers or value added resellers to address customer satisfaction issues or solution fit issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price adjustments  specific provisions for returns  price protection or rebates in agreements  and other factors known at the time 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from estimates  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
distributor revenue is recognized under agreements that allow pricing credits  price protection  rebates and rights of return or involve international jurisdictions where the risk of returns or credits is considered to be high even though distributors do not have these contractual rights 
as a consequence  the company has determined that the sales price is not fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to a distributor and thus these shipments do not meet the requirements for revenue recognition until the sales price is known  which is only reliably determinable at the time of sell through to an end customer or value added reseller 
this includes substantially all of our international sales and sales through our two united states distributors 
in the us  substantially all of our sales are to value added resellers or end customers for which revenue is recognized upon delivery 
revenue for product sales through distributors without reliable sell through reporting is deferred until maintenance is purchased for the related product 
the costs of distributor inventories not yet recognized as revenue are deferred as a reduction of the related deferred revenue  the result of which is shown as deferred revenue  net on our consolidated balance sheets 
multiple element arrangements we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of hardware  software  software upgrades  hardware and software maintenance and support  training and consulting services 
we account for multiple agreements with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual terms and or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are  in effect  parts of a single arrangement 
most of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that operate together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  the software sold with our hardware appliances are considered non software deliverables and are not accounted for under the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
our non software products and services qualify as separate units of accounting because they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and our revenue arrangements do not include a general right of return for delivered products 
our products and licenses revenue also includes stand alone software products 
stand alone software may operate on our hardware appliances  but is not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware and continues to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance includes the use of the residual method 
we provide unspecified software upgrades for most of our products  on a when and if available basis  through maintenance and support contracts 
to the extent that the software being supported is not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware  these support arrangements would continue to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 

table of contents we allocate the arrangement fee to each element based upon the relative selling price of that element and  if software and software related eg  maintenance for the software element elements are also included in the arrangement  we allocate the arrangement fee to each of those software and software related elements as a group based on the relative selling price for those elements 
after such allocations are made  the amount of the arrangement fee allocated to the software and software related elements is accounted for using the residual method 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each element using vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of selling price  if it exists  or if not  third party evidence  or tpe  of selling price  if it exists 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for an element  we use our best estimate of selling price  or besp  for that element 
the revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for that element 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting any specified performance conditions 
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sales to third parties 
for maintenance and support  training and consulting services  we determine the vsoe of fair value based on our history of stand alone sales demonstrating that a substantial majority of transactions fall within a narrow range for each service offering 
we historically have not been able to determine tpe for our products  maintenance and support  training or consulting services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately 
generally  our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the selling price of an element using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of consideration to various elements under the arrangement 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
the besp is established based on internal and external factors  including pricing practices such as discounting  cost of products  the geographies in which we offer our products and services  and customer classes and distribution channels eg distributor  value added reseller and direct end user 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by our management  taking into consideration our pricing model and go to market strategy 
for our non software deliverables  we generally use besp as our selling price 
however  for our maintenance and support  training and consulting services  we generally use vsoe as our selling price 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe for our maintenance and support  training and consulting services  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
we regularly review vsoe and besp data provided by actual transactions to update these estimates and the relative selling prices allocated to each element 

table of contents stock based compensation our stock based compensation expense for stock options  restricted stock units rsus and purchases under the espp is estimated at the grant date based on the award fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm option pricing model changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre vesting termination behavior of employees 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
pre ipo common stock valuations for all option grants prior to our ipo  the fair value of the common stock underlying the option grants was determined by our board of directors  with the assistance of management  which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant 
because there was no public market for our common stock before our ipo  our board of directors determined the fair value of the common stock at the time of grant of the option by considering a number of objective and subjective factors  including valuations of comparable companies  sales of our convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties  operating and financial performance  the lack of liquidity of our capital stock and general and industry specific economic outlook 
we did not grant stock options with an exercise price that was less than the fair value of the underlying common stock as determined at the time of grant by our board of directors 
the fair value of the underlying common stock was determined by our board of directors until our ipo 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we make significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions  and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base  and the expected use of the acquired assets 
these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 
the value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as  but not limited to a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  b a substantial decline in our market capitalization  c an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  d unanticipated competition  e loss of key personnel  f a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  g a realignment of our resources or restructuring of our existing businesses in response to changes to industry and market conditions  h testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit  or i higher discount rate used in the impairment analysis as impacted by an increase in interest rates 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of may st or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit carrying value  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
we operate under one reporting unit and for our annual goodwill impairment analysis  we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our enterprise value 

table of contents long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
among the factors and circumstances we considered in determining recoverability are i a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  ii a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  iii a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iv an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition  and v current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
there have been no indicators of impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets  and we did not record any impairment losses during the years ended july   and income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach for deferred income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the realization guidance available 
to the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized  we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred income tax assets 
we regularly assess the need for the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  and to the extent that we determine that an adjustment is needed  that adjustment will be recorded in the period that the determination is made 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
based on these factors  we have determined it is appropriate to record a full valuation allowance against our federal and state net deferred tax assets but to recognize certain foreign deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we are able to realize all or part of our federal or state net deferred tax assets in the future  we would generally decrease the valuation allowance and record a corresponding benefit to earnings in the period in which we make that determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are not more likely than not to realize all or a part of our recognized foreign deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and record a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make that determination 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
we are subject to income tax audits in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that would result from potential challenges 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities require management judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions is adequate 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 

table of contents we regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized 
we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when those estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 
for the years ended july   and  we did not incur any interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
loss contingencies we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
recent accounting pronouncements please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under part ii  item for recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and therefore our net revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located  which are primarily in north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are  therefore  subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments 
during fiscal july   the effect of a hypothetical basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million as of july  we hold our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments for working capital purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits and money market funds 
our short term investments are held in us treasury securities  us government agency securities and fdic backed certificates of deposit 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future interest income 
during fiscal  the effect of a hypothetical basis point shift in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income
