the vast majority of the company products are  in turn  sold to end customers who are not members of its sales force 
the company is largely dependent upon these independent sales organizations and individuals to reach end consumers  and any significant disruption of this distribution network would have a negative financial impact on the company and its ability to generate sales  earnings and operating cash flows 
the company primary business drivers are the size  activity and productivity of its independent sales organizations 
as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons  the company believes the presentation of results on a local currency basis  as a supplement to reported results  helps improve readers ability to understand those results and evaluate performance in comparison with prior periods 
the company presents local currency information that compares results between periods as if current period exchange rates had been the exchange rates in the prior period 
the company uses results on a local currency basis as one measure to evaluate performance 
the company generally refers to such amounts as calculated on a local currency basis or excluding the impact of foreign currency 
these results should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
results on a local currency basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

these charges are discussed in the re engineering costs section following 
the company s goodwill and intangible assets relate primarily to the december acquisition of the direct to consumer businesses of sara lee corporation and the october acquisition of beauticontrol 
the company conducts an annual assessment of goodwill and intangible assets in the third quarter of each year  other than for beauticontrol where the annual valuation is performed in the second quarter  and in other quarters in the event of a change in circumstances that would lead the company to believe that a triggering event for impairment may have occurred 
refer to note of the consolidated statements 
during the second quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment test of the beauticontrol reporting units  resulting in an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill in the beauticontrol united states and canada business 
this was a result of the rates of growth of sales  profit and cash flow and expectations for future performance that were below the company previous projections 
also in the second quarter  the financial performance of the nutrimetics reporting units fell below their previous trend line and it became apparent that they would fall significantly short of previous expectations for the year 
additionally  reductions in the forecasted operating trends of naturcare  relating to declines in the rates of growth of sales  profit and cash flows in the japanese market  led to interim impairment testing in both these businesses  as of the end of may and june  respectively 
the result of these tests was to record tradename impairments of million for nutrimetics and million for naturcare  primarily due to the use of lower estimated royalty rates in light of lower sales and profit forecasts for these units  as well as macroeconomic factors that increased the discount rates used in the valuations versus those used previously 
in addition  the company wrote off the million and million carrying value of the goodwill of the nutrimetics asia pacific and nutrimetics europe reporting units  respectively  in light of then current operating trends and expected future results  as well as the macroeconomic factors that increased the discount rates used in the valuations

the result of the impairment tests was to record a million impairment to the nutrimetics goodwill in the asia pacific reporting unit and a million impairment to its tradename 
during  the company decided it would cease operating its swissgarde unit 
as a result of this decision  the company concluded that its intangible assets and goodwill were impaired

there were no land sales under this program in or due to negative developments in the real estate market  including ramifications of the credit crisis in the united states 
gains on land transactions are recorded based upon when the transactions close and proceeds are collected 
transactions in one period may not be representative of what may occur in future periods 
since the company began this program in  cumulative proceeds from these sales have totaled million and currently are expected to be up to an additional million when the program is completed 
the carrying value of the remaining land included in the company land sales program was million as of december  this amount was included in property  plant and equipment held for use within the consolidated balance sheet as it is not considered probable that any land sales will be completed within one year

re engineering costs as the company continuously evaluates its operating structure in light of current business conditions and strives to maintain the most efficient possible structure  it periodically implements actions designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency 
these actions often result in re engineering costs related to facility downsizing and closure  as well as related asset write downs and other costs that may be necessary in light of the revised operating landscape

this was partially offset by higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances held during in brazil  china and india 
tax rate the effective tax rates for  and were  and percent  respectively 
the comparatively higher tax rate was due to the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges 
as a result of tax law changes in mexico  an election was made during that resulted in a reduction of million of deferred tax liabilities 
the company also incurred in  additional costs of million associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 
during  the company decided to repatriate earnings from australia and certain other foreign units that were previously determined to be indefinitely reinvested in order to take advantage of historically favorable exchange rates 
the effective tax rates for  and are below the us statutory rate  reflecting the availability of excess foreign tax credits  as well as lower foreign effective tax rates 
tax rates are affected by many factors  including the global mix of earnings  changes in tax legislation  acquisitions or dispositions as well as the tax characteristics of income 
the company is required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities  uncertain tax positions and assessments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets in determining the income tax provision 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets based upon its analysis of the likelihood of realizing the benefits inherent in them 
at december  and december   the company had valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets totaling million and million  respectively 
these valuation allowances relate to tax assets in jurisdictions where it is management best estimate that there is not a greater than percent probability that the benefit of the assets will be realized in the associated tax returns 
this assessment is based upon expected future domestic results  future foreign dividends from then current year earnings and cash flows and other foreign source income  including rents and royalties  as well as anticipated gains related to future sales of land held for development near the company orlando  florida headquarters 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions may be entered into to facilitate realization of these benefits 
in evaluating uncertain tax positions  the company makes determinations regarding the application of complex tax rules  regulations and practices 
uncertain tax positions are evaluated based on many factors including but not limited to changes in tax laws  new developments and the impact of settlements on future periods 
refer to the critical accounting policies section and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussions of the company methodology for evaluating deferred tax assets 
as of december  and december   the company gross unrecognized tax benefit was million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the accrual for uncertain tax positions decreased million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions 
the accrual also increased for positions being taken during the year in various tax filings 
the accrual is further impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company estimates that it may settle one or more foreign audits in the next twelve months that may result in a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of up to million 
for the remaining balance as of december   the company is not able to reliably estimate the timing or ultimate settlement amount 
while the company does not currently expect material changes  it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease related to audits in various foreign jurisdictions that may conclude during that period or new developments that could also  in turn  impact the company assessment relative to the establishment of valuation allowances against certain existing deferred tax assets 
at this time  the company is not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items

also contributing to the segment sales increase was venezuela due to higher pricing reflecting inflation and a modest increase in the size and activity of the sales force  as well as uruguay and argentina due to higher pricing in line with inflation 
the company estimates that one third of the overall local currency sales increase by the segment was from price increases 
segment profit increased million  or percent  in compared with segment profit as a percentage of sales  at percent  was percentage points higher than the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the comparison was minimal 
the increase in profit mainly reflected higher sales volume in brazil and  to a lesser extent  in venezuela  as well as more efficient promotional spending and leverage from the higher sales on the fixed components of ds a spending 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources net working capital was million as of december   compared with million as of december  and million as of december  the current ratio was to at the end of and  and to at the end of the most significant component in the company s million reduction in net working capital in was million less cash and cash equivalents  which together with cash flow from operating activities  was the main source of funding the cash outflow during the year for investing activities  dividends and share repurchases 
while both inventory and accounts receivable increased modestly  this was largely offset by an increase in accrued liabilities  including accrued compensation related to management incentives 

table of contents the company s net working capital decreased as of the end of compared with  primarily reflecting a lower level of cash as of the end of and borrowings under its revolving credit facility  both of which were used to repurchase shares 
there was also an impact from a reduction in receivables  reflecting the timing of collections around the company fiscal year end 
there was a partial offset from a higher level of inventory to support a higher level of sales generally  along with more specific instances where inventory was increased in units to enable a better level of service to customers and in light of sales below expectations 
there was also an increase in deferred tax assets and a decrease in accrued liabilities  largely from lower income taxes payable due to the timing of the company tax payments around year end 
on june   the company completed the sale of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june  the senior notes at an issue price of  as well as entered into a new million multicurrency revolving credit agreement the credit agreement 
the proceeds were used to repay all of the company million term loans outstanding under the company previous credit facility from september old credit facility  which was terminated on the same date 
the company is permitted to request  on up to three separate occasions  an increase to its borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by up to million in the aggregate for a maximum aggregate facility amount of million 
loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest under a formula that includes  at the company option  one of three different base rates 
the company generally selects the london interbank offered rate libor for the applicable currency and interest period as its base for its interest rate 
as provided in the credit facility  a margin is added to the base 
the applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing schedule based upon the ratio the consolidated leverage ratio of the consolidated funded indebtedness of the company and its subsidiaries to the consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of the company and its subsidiaries for the four fiscal quarters then most recently ended 
as of december   the credit agreement dictated a base rate spread of basis points  which gave the company a weighted average interest rate of percent on million of total borrowings under the credit agreement  of which million was denominated in euros 
the company routinely increases its revolver borrowings under the credit agreement during each quarter to fund operating  investing and financing activities and uses cash available at the end of each quarter to reduce borrowing levels 
as a result  the company has higher foreign exchange exposure on the value of its cash during each quarter than at the end of each quarter 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants  including financial covenants requiring minimum interest coverage and allowing a maximum amount of leverage 
as of december   the company had  and currently has  considerable leeway under its financial covenants 
however  economic conditions  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  lower than foreseen sales and profit or the occurrence of other events discussed under forward looking statements and elsewhere could cause noncompliance 
the company monitors the financial stability of third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents and diversifies its cash and cash equivalents among counterparties  which minimizes exposure to any one of these entities 
furthermore  the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and the possible liquidity and credit risks of its counterparties 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its working capital and capital spending needs and its current dividend 
this liquidity includes its year end cash and cash equivalents balance of million  cash flows from operating activities  and access to its million credit agreement 
as of december   the company had million available under its credit agreement and million available under other uncommitted lines of credit 
the company has not experienced any limitations on its ability to access its committed facility 
on february   in conjunction with executing its planned share repurchase program  the company entered into a day million promissory note with the same interest rate and covenant terms as under its million credit agreement 
the company expects to make further changes to its financing arrangements in in order to fund its investing and financing activities 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents cash totaled million as of december  of this amount  million was held by foreign subsidiaries 
approximately percent of the cash held outside of the united states was not eligible for repatriation due to the level of past statutory earnings by the foreign unit in which the cash was held or other local restrictions 
the remaining cash is subject to repatriation tax effects 
the company current intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds in its foreign operations  as the cash is needed to fund on going operations 
in the event circumstances change  leading to the conclusion that these funds will not be indefinitely reinvested  the company would need to provide at that time for the income taxes that would be triggered upon their repatriation 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposures are to the euro  indonesian rupiah and mexican peso 
business units in which the company generated at least million of sales in included brazil  tupperware france  fuller mexico  germany  indonesia  malaysia singapore  tupperware mexico and tupperware united states and canada 
a significant downturn in the company s business in these units would adversely impact its ability to generate operating cash flows 
operating cash flows would also be adversely impacted by significant difficulties in the recruitment  retention and activity of the company s independent sales force or the success of new products and or promotional programs 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared with million in net income before the impacts of non cash charges for goodwill and intangible assets and gains on disposal of assets in both periods  reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments into operating income in and non cash interest swap impairments in  was million higher in than other more significant factors impacting the year over year comparison of cash flow from operating activities were a smaller increase in inventory due to success in managing to a lower number of days on hand  and offsetting effects in the comparison of trade receivables and accounts payable and accruals associated with the company fiscal year ending before the end of the calendar month of december in but not in net cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared with million in the decrease in operating cash flow in  notwithstanding a million increase in net income excluding the non cash impairment charges  primarily reflected the timing of distributions for payables and accruals around the beginning of each year resulting from the extra week in inventory levels also increased during due to purchases to support higher sales and customer service levels in certain markets and in light of sales below forecast in other markets 
investing activities in  and  the company spent million  million and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
the most significant type of spending in all years was for molds for new products  with the greatest amount spent in europe  and vehicles for the sales force

in the first quarters of and  the board increased the regular quarterly dividend per share by percent  to in and percent to in it also increased the regular quarterly dividend by percent to per share with its declaration in november the payment of a dividend on common shares is a discretionary decision and subject to a significant event that would require cash  the ability to continue to comply with debt covenants  cash needed to finance operations  making necessary investments in the future growth of the business  required or discretionary debt repayment obligations or other cash needs 
if there is an event requiring the use of cash  such as a strategic acquisition  the company would need to reevaluate whether to maintain its dividend payout 
stock option exercises during  and  the company received proceeds of million  million and million  respectively  related to the exercise of stock options 
the corresponding shares were issued out of the company s balance held in treasury 
stock repurchases the company board of directors increased its existing share repurchase authorization in february to allow open market repurchases with an aggregate cost of up to million until february  the company expected  at that time  to use proceeds from stock option exercises and excess cash generated by the business to offset dilution associated with the company equity incentive plans  with the intention of keeping the number of shares outstanding at about million 
in  the company board increased the share repurchase authorization on two occasions to a total of billion 
in january  the board further increased the share repurchase authorization by million to billion and extended the term of the authorization by two years to february  going forward  in setting share repurchase amounts  the company expects to target over time a debt to ebitda ratio of times consolidated funded debt as defined in the company credit agreement  which is an increase of a quarter point from its previous target leverage ratio of times consolidated funded debt  as targeted since during  and the company repurchased in the open market million  million and million shares under this program at an aggregate cost of million  million and million  respectively

table of contents contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 
total less than year years years more than years debt obligations interest payments on long term obligations pension benefits post employment medical benefits income tax payments a capital commitments b operating lease obligations total contractual obligations c a the company has not included in the above table amounts related to its other unrecognized tax positions  as it is unable to make a reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these items might lead to payments 
as of december  the company s total gross unrecognized tax positions were million 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next months based on the results of tax examinations  expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and additions due to ongoing transactions and activity 
however  the company is unable to estimate the impact of such events 
b capital commitments represent signed agreements as of december  on relatively minor capital projects in process in the company s brazil  indonesia  portugal manufacturing and tupperware south africa units 
c the table excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding  are generally consistent from year to year  and are short term in nature 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the implementation of the following critical accounting policies are the most significantly affected by its judgments and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains current receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets 
it also maintains long term receivable amounts with certain of these customers 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts current and past due  along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
it is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects  particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due 
this evaluation is performed market by market and account by account  based upon historical experience  market penetration levels and similar factors 
it also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts 
the company records its allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the results of this analysis 
the analysis requires the company to make significant estimates and as such  changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company considers any receivable balance not collected within its contractual terms past due 

table of contents inventory valuation the company writes down its inventory for obsolescence or unmarketability in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value based upon expected future demand and pricing 
the demand and pricing is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs  new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels 
the company prepares projections of demand and pricing on an item by item basis for all of its products 
if inventory on hand exceeds projected demand or the expected market value is less than the carrying value  the excess is written down to its net realizable value 
however  if actual demand or the estimate of market decreases  additional write downs would be required 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
at december  and december   the company had valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets totaling million and million  respectively 
these valuation allowances relate to tax assets in jurisdictions where it is management best estimate that there is not a greater than percent probability that the benefit of the assets will be realized in the associated tax returns 
at the end of  the company had gross domestic deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
of these total assets  approximately million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items 
the balance is primarily related to foreign tax credits and federal and state net operating losses that  other than for the amount for which a valuation allowance has been provided  are expected to be realized prior to expiration 
this assessment is based upon expected future domestic results  future foreign dividends from then current year earnings and cash flows and other foreign source income  including rents and royalties  as well as anticipated gains related to future sales of land held for development near the company orlando  florida headquarters 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions may be entered into to facilitate realization of these benefits 
these estimates are made based upon the company business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis  consequently  future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible 
any change in valuation allowance amounts is reflected in the period in which the change occurs 
as of december  and december   the company gross unrecognized tax benefit was million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the accrual for uncertain tax positions decreased million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions 
the accrual also increased for positions being taken during the year in various tax filings 
the accrual is further impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the company global operations are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes 
accrued interest and penalties were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
interest and penalties included in the provision for income taxes totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company estimates that it may settle one or more foreign audits in the next twelve months that may result in a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of up to million 
for the remaining balance as of december   the company is not able to reliably estimate the timing or ultimate settlement amount 
while the company does not currently expect material changes  it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease related to audits in various foreign jurisdictions that may conclude during that period or new developments that could also  in turn  impact the company assessment relative to the establishment of valuation allowances against certain existing deferred tax assets 
at this time  the company is not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items 

table of contents promotional and other accruals the company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels  party attendance  recruiting or other business critical activities 
the awards offered are in the form of cash  product awards  special prizes or trips 
the cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award 
these accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred 
the company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis 
it considers the historical success of similar programs  current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched 
during the promotion qualification period  actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known 
like promotional accruals  other accruals are recorded at the time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes occur in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual 
goodwill and intangible assets the company s recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of beauticontrol in october and the sara lee direct to consumer businesses in december the company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in each of its eight reporting units in the second and third quarter of each year related to beauticontrol and the former sara lee direct to consumer units  respectively 
additionally  in the event of a change in circumstances that leads the company to determine that a triggering event for impairment testing has occurred  a test is completed at that time 
the annual process for evaluating goodwill begins with an assessment for each entity of qualitative factors to determine whether the two step goodwill impairment test is necessary 
further testing is only performed if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying value 
the qualitative factors evaluated by the company include macro economic conditions of the local business environment  overall financial performance  sensitivity analysis from the most recent step one fair value test  and other entity specific factors as deemed appropriate 
when the company determines the two step goodwill impairment test is necessary  the first step involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  after any long lived asset impairment charges 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to determine whether there is a goodwill impairment  and if so  the amount of the loss 
this step revalues all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to their current fair value and then compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
prior to  the company annual assessment began with the two step impairment test 
the company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and tradenames acquired in conjunction with its purchase of the sara lee direct to consumer businesses 
certain tradenames are allocated between multiple reporting units 
the company early adopted accounting standards update  testing indefinite lived intangibles for impairment the asu in connection with the performance of its annual impairment testing of its tradenames 
under the asu  entities are provided the option of first performing a qualitative assessment that is similar to the assessment performed for goodwill 
when the company determines it is necessary  the quantitative impairment test for the company tradenames involves comparing the estimated fair value of the assets to the carrying amounts  to determine if fair value is lower and a write down required 
if the carrying amount of a tradename exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 

table of contents during the second quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment test of the beauticontrol reporting units  resulting in an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill in the beauticontrol united states and canada business 
this was a result of the rates of growth of sales  profit and cash flow and expectations for future performance that were below the company previous projections 
also in the second quarter  the financial performance of the nutrimetics reporting units fell below their previous trend line and it became apparent that they would fall significantly short of previous expectations for the year 
additionally  reductions in the forecasted operating trends of naturcare relating to declines in the rates of growth of sales  profit and cash flows in the japanese market led to interim impairment testing in both these businesses  as of the end of may and june  respectively 
the result of these tests was to record tradename impairments of million for nutrimetics and million for naturcare  primarily due to the use of lower estimated royalty rates in light of lower sales and profit forecasts for these units  as well as macroeconomic factors that increased the discount rates used in the valuations versus those used previously 
in addition  the company wrote off the million and million carrying value of the goodwill of the nutrimetics asia pacific and nutrimetics europe reporting units  respectively  in light of then current operating trends and expected future results  as well as the macroeconomic factors that increased the discount rates used in the valuations 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the annual impairment assessments for all of the reporting units and tradename intangibles  except for beauticontrol which was completed in the second quarter  determining there was no impairment 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the annual impairment tests for all of the reporting units and tradenames  other than beauticontrol  which was completed in the second quarter 
during the third quarter of  the financial results of nutrimetics were below expectations 
the company also made at that time  the decision to cease operating its nutrimetics business in malaysia 
as a result  the company lowered its forecast of future sales and profit 
the result of the impairment tests was to record a million impairment to the nutrimetics goodwill in the asia pacific reporting unit and a million impairment to its tradename 
during  the company completed the annual impairment tests for all of the reporting units and tradenames  determining there was no impairment 
the company subsequently decided it would cease operating its swissgarde unit in southern africa as a separate business 
as a result of this decision  the company concluded that its intangible assets and goodwill were impaired and recorded a million impairment to the swissgarde tradename  a million impairment related to the sales force intangible and a million impairment to goodwill relating to the south african beauty reporting unit 
during  the company sold its interest in swissgarde for million that resulted in a gain of million 

table of contents fair value of the beauticontrol united states and canada  nutrimetics and naturcare reporting units was determined by the company in the second quarter of using a combination of the income and market approaches with generally a greater weighting on the income approach percent 
when the characteristics of the reporting unit are more similar to the guideline public companies in terms of size  markets and economy  then a more equal weighting is used between the income and market approaches 
the income approach  or discounted cash flow approach  requires significant assumptions to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
these include estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows  including projections of revenue  costs  utilization of assets and capital requirements  along with an estimate as to the appropriate discount rate to be used 
the most sensitive estimate in this valuation is the projection of operating cash flows  as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation 
the company s cash flow model uses forecasts for periods of about years and a terminal value 
the significant assumptions for these forecasts in included annual revenue growth rates ranging from negative percent to positive percent with an average growth rate of positive percent 
the growth rates were determined by reviewing historical results of these units and the historical results of the company s other business units that are similar to those of the reporting units  along with the expected contribution from growth strategies implemented in the units 
terminal values for all reporting units were calculated using a long term growth rate of percent 
in estimating the fair value of these reporting units in  the company applied discount rates to the projected cash flows ranging from to percent 
the discount rate at the high end of this range was for the nutrimetics asia pacific reporting unit due to higher country specific risks 
the market approach relies on an analysis of publicly traded companies similar to tupperware and deriving a range of revenue and profit multiples 
the publicly traded companies used in the market approach were selected based on their having similar product lines of consumer goods  beauty products and or companies using direct to consumer or network marketing distribution methods 
the resulting multiples were then applied to the reporting unit to determine fair value 
the fair value of the nutrimetics and naturcare tradenames were determined in the second quarter using the relief from royalty method  which is a form of the income approach 
in this method  the value of the asset is calculated by selecting royalty rates  which estimate the amount a company would be willing to pay for the use of the asset 
these rates were applied to the company s projected revenue  tax affected and discounted to present value 
royalty rates used were selected by reviewing comparable trademark licensing agreements in the market and the forecasted performance of the business 
as a result  the royalty rates were reduced to percent from percent for nutrimetics and percent from percent for naturcare 
in estimating the fair value of the tradenames  the company applied discount rates of and percent  respectively  and annual revenue growth ranging from negative percent to positive percent  with an average growth rate of positive percent  and a long term terminal growth rate of percent 
with the tradename impairment recorded in the current year for nutrimetics and naturcare  these assets are at a higher risk of additional impairments in future periods if changes in certain assumptions occur 
there is no longer a goodwill balance recorded related to nutrimetics or beauticontrol united states and canada 
the estimated fair value of the naturcare reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by percent as of june given the sensitivity of the valuations to changes in cash flow or market multiples  the company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to the company s performance 
actual results below forecasted results or a decrease in the forecasted future results of the company s business plans or changes in discount rates could also result in an impairment charge  as could changes in market characteristics including declines in valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies 
further impairment charges would have an adverse impact on the company s net income and shareholders equity 
additionally  as of december  the company had million included on its consolidated balance sheets as the value of acquired sales forces 
the estimated annual amortization expense associated with these intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   a product formulation asset recorded as part of the acquisition was fully amortized 

table of contents retirement obligations pensions the company records pension costs and the funded status of its defined benefit pension plans using the applicable accounting guidance for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this guidance requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the measurement of the retirement obligations and costs of providing benefits under the company s pension plans involves various factors  including several assumptions 
the company believes the most critical of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate and government bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plans 
the discount rate assumptions used to determine pension expense for the company s us and foreign plans was as follows discount rate us plans foreign plans the company has established strategic asset allocation percentage targets for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance between risk and return 
the company periodically revises asset allocations  where appropriate  in an effort to improve return and manage risk 
the estimated rate of return is based on long term expectations given current investment objectives and historical results 
the expected rate of return assumptions used by the company for its us and foreign plans were as follows expected rate of return us plans foreign plans the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pension expense due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company s pension plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  basis points in millions increase decrease discount rate change by basis points expected rate of return on plan assets change by basis points other post retirement benefits the company accounts for its post retirement benefit plan in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination requires the selection of various assumptions  including a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of return on high quality  long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plan 
the discount rate assumptions used by the company to determine other post retirement benefit expense were percent  percent  and percent for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
a change in discount rate of basis points would not be material 

table of contents the following are the assumed health care cost trend rates used by the company health care trend rates initial health care cost trend ultimate health care cost trend year ultimate trend rate achieved the healthcare cost trend rate assumption may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on post retirement benefit obligation revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the price is fixed  the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer who  in most cases  is one of the company s independent distributors or a member of its independent sales force  and when collection is reasonably assured 
when revenue is recorded  estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue 
discounts earned based on promotional programs in place  volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for stock based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options  which requires the input of assumptions  including dividend yield  risk free interest rate  the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of the company common stock price over the expected term 
furthermore  in calculating compensation expense for these awards  the company is also required to estimate the extent to which options will be forfeited prior to vesting forfeitures 
many factors are considered when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment to the previously recorded amounts 
impact of inflation inflation  as measured by consumer price indices  has continued at a low level in most of the countries in which the company operates  except for argentina and venezuela

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of the company market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on its borrowings 
the company borrowings under the credit agreement carry a variable interest rate 
the company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings and the currencies in which it borrows 

table of contents loans taken under the credit agreement bear interest under a formula that includes  at the company option  one of three different base rates  plus an applicable spread 
the company generally selects the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of december   the credit agreement dictated a spread of basis points  which gave the company an interest rate of percent on borrowings under the credit agreement 
going forward  in light of the company share repurchase program  the company is targeting an increase in its debt to ebitda ratio from times consolidated funded indebtedness to times consolidated funded indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement as of the end of each quarter 
at this level of leverage  the spread would increase by basis points 
of the company short term borrowings as of december   million was denominated in euro and million in us dollars 
if short term interest rates varied by percent  with all other variables remaining constant  the company annual interest expense would not be significantly impacted 
the company routinely increases its revolver borrowings under the credit agreement during each quarter to fund operating  investing and financing activities and uses cash available at the end of each quarter to reduce borrowing levels 
as a result  the company has higher foreign exchange exposure on the value of its cash during each quarter than at the end of each quarter 
a significant portion of the company sales and profit come from its international operations 
although these operations are geographically dispersed  which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries  the company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations 
these risks include local political and economic environments and relations between foreign and us governments 
another economic risk of the company is exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of its international operations 
the company is not able to project  in any meaningful way  the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings 
this is due to the company constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the us dollar and the large number of currencies involved  although the company most significant exposures are to the euro  indonesia rupiah and mexican peso  as well as the brazilian real and malaysian ringgit 
although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the company local product sourcing in many markets  a strengthening us dollar generally has a negative impact on the company 
in response to this fact  the company uses financial instruments  such as forward contracts  to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations 
in addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates  the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations 
the company also hedges  with these instruments  certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable  non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases 
the company generally does not seek to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translated value of the sales  profit or cash flow generated by its operations 
while the company hedges of its equity in its foreign subsidiaries and its fair value hedges of balance sheet risks all work together to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses  they result in an impact to operating cash flows as they are settled 
the cash flow impact of these currency hedges was an inflow of million and million in and  respectively  and an outflow of million in the us dollar equivalent of the company most significant net open foreign currency hedge positions as of december  were to buy us dollar million  euro million  malaysian ringgit million and indonesian rupiah million  and to sell swiss franc million  japanese yen million  mexican peso million  australian dollar million and turkish lira million 
in agreements to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  for example  an appreciating dollar versus the opposing currency would generate a cash inflow for the company at settlement  with the opposite result in agreements to buy foreign currencies for us dollars 
the above noted notional amounts change based upon changes in the company outstanding currency exposures 
based on rates existing as of december   the company was in a net payable position of approximately million related to its currency hedges  which  upon settlement  could have a significant impact on the company cash flow 
the company records the impact of forward points in net interest expense 

table of contents a precise calculation of the impact of currency fluctuations is not practical since some of the contracts are between non us dollar currencies

the company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and  in particular  the cost of oil and natural gas based resins 
this is the primary material used in production of most tupperware products  and the company estimates that cost of sales will include about million for the cost of resin in the tupperware brand products it produces 
the company uses many different kinds of resins in its products 
about three fourths of its resins are polyolefins simple chemical structure  easily refined from oil  and as such  the price of these is strongly affected by the underlying price of oil and natural gas 
the remaining one fourth of its resins is more highly engineered  where the price of oil and natural gas plays a less direct role in determining price 
with a comparable product mix and exchange rates  a percent fluctuation in the cost of resin would impact the company annual cost of sales by about million compared with the prior year 
for  the company estimates its cost of sales of the tupperware products it produced was positively impacted by about million in local currency due to resin cost changes  as compared with for the full year of  the impact of resin cost changes  on a local currency basis  on the company cost of sales of the tupperware products it produces is expected to be positive million  as compared with the company partially manages its risk associated with rising resin costs by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements 
it also manages its margin through the pricing of its products  with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation in each market  and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers 
it may also  on occasion  make advance material purchases to take advantage of current favorable pricing 
at this point in time  the company has determined that entering into forward contracts for resin is not practical or cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place 
however  should circumstances warrant  the company may consider such contracts in the future
