critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and should be read as an integral part of the discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial position 
for additional accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
the company has entered into a number of license agreements covering potential products using the company s spd technology 
the company receives fees and minimum annual royalties under certain license agreements and records fee income on a ratable basis each quarter 
in instances when sales of licensed products by its licensees exceed minimum annual royalties  the company recognizes fee income as the amounts have been earned 
certain of the fees are accrued by  or paid to  the company in advance of the period in which they are earned resulting in deferred revenue 
the company expenses costs relating to the development or acquisition of patents due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of these items 
all of our research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for internal and external research and development 
these costs include direct and indirect overhead expenses 
the company has historically used the black scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of each option grant 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives  and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but these items involve uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years 
on occasion  the company may issue to consultants either options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the company at specified share prices 
these options or warrants may vest based upon specific services being performed or performance criteria being met 
in accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  the company would be required to record consulting expenses based upon the fair value of such options or warrants on the earlier of the service period or the period that such options or warrants vest as determined using a black scholes option pricing model 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
an example of a critical estimate is the full valuation allowance for deferred taxes that was recorded based on the uncertainty that such tax benefits will be realized in future periods
