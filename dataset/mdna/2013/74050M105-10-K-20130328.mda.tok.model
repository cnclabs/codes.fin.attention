the activities of both the internal and external audit functions are reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 
forward looking statements management discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier growth or lack thereof  premier ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
the words may  could  should  would  will  believe  anticipate  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  predict  continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and management discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the presentation and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

management s discussion and analysis december  allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment using accounting guidance issued by financial accounting standards board fasb 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by accounting guidance 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements

management s discussion and analysis december  business acquisitions and impairment of goodwill fr acquisitions  premier is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
the loans acquired via the purchase of abigail adams national bancorp on october  and the branch purchase were recorded on the books of premier at their estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates required management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and are inherently uncertain 
since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  consistent with new accounting guidance for acquisitions after  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded by premier at the date of acquisition 
however  in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail due to uncertainties in the economy  the borrower s ability to repay or other factors  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
under accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of the company banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management impairment analysis

management s discussion and analysis december  summary financial results premier had net income available to common shareholders of million in compared to million of net income available to common shareholders in and million of net income available to common shareholders reported for net income available to common shareholders increased in largely due to decreased operating expenses  an increase in income from asset sales such as securities and loans and a discount recognized on the purchase and retirement of  shares of premier s series a preferred stock 
net income available to common shareholders decreased in when compared to  largely due to increased expenses  primarily data processing expenses and expenses related to converting data processing systems 
otherwise  net interest income and non interest income increased in  partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses 
basic earnings per share were in compared to in and in the increase in earnings per shares in is largely due to increases in net income discussed above 
the decrease in earnings per share in is largely due to the increase in non interest expenses discussed above 
the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years 
return on average assets roa measures how effectively premier utilizes its assets to produce net income 
it also facilitates the analysis of earnings performance of different sized organizations 
in  premier increased the size of its balance sheet with the acquisition of abigail adams national bancorp  inc abigail adams 
the result was an increase in total assets from million at the end of  to  million at the end of  largely due to the acquisition 
in  total assets declined slightly to  million at december  and at december   total assets remained relatively unchanged at  million 
an increase in asset size will generally result in higher dollars of income earned and expenses incurred 
a detailed review of the components of roa will help analyze premier s performance without regard to changes in its size 
premier s net income available to common shareholders in resulted in an roa of  an increase from the roa in and the roa in as shown in the following table  fully taxable equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets reached its highest level during the last five years in both and at 
in  this percentage was and decreased in to as yields on earning assets declined as a result of a lower overall interest rate environment due to federal reserve policies designed to stimulate national economic growth 
in  fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased to as the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities fell more quickly in than the yield earned on average earning assets 
in  net interest income decreased to of average earning assets as the yield on earning assets decreased by more than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in  net interest income returned to of average earnings assets largely due to a continuing decrease in rates paid on deposits while the overall yield on loans held steady at

management s discussion and analysis december  while net interest income as a percent of average earning assets repeated its highest level during the last five years in at  net credit income as a percentage of average earning assets repeated its lowest level in at  duplicating the same performance as in net credit income reduces the net interest income earned by the provision for loan losses recorded during the year 
in  net credit income as a percentage of average earning assets reached its highest level over the past five years at due to minimal provisions for losses reducing the net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets reached its highest level in the past five years at while non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets totaled 
in  net credit income as a percent of average earning assets declined to  as the lower net interest income was lowered even further by a higher provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets 
further lowering premier s return on average assets in was lower non interest income and the highest non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets in the last five years  largely due to acquisition related expenses  a special fdic insurance assessment  and writedowns on the value of other real estate owned oreo 
adding to premier s return on average assets in was a gain recognized on the acquisition of abigail adams and lower income tax expense 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to decrease premier return on average earning assets to and decrease its return on average total assets roa to 
in  the increase in net interest income as a percent of average earning assets was more than offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets lowering net credit income to of average earning assets 
further lowering premier s return on average assets in was lower non interest income as a percent of average earning assets due to lower deposit customer fee income in relation to the total deposits outstanding and no gain on the acquisition of a subsidiary as was recorded in on the positive side  non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets decreased in to compared to in  largely due to reduced acquisition related expenses and lower oreo costs due to gains realized on the disposition of some oreo properties in lastly  dividends and accretion accrued on premier s series a preferred stock also serve to reduce net income available to common shareholders and thus reduce premier s roa 
in  preferred stock dividends and accretion totaled as a percent of average earning assets 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to decrease premier return on average earning assets to and decrease its return on average total assets roa to 
in  net interest income as a percent of average earning assets decreased from and was further reduced by a slight increase in the provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets lowering net credit income to of average earning assets  the lowest percentage in the five year period presented 
non interest income as a percent of average earning assets held steady in compared to  but non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets increased to  largely due to the increase in data processing expenses and the conversion expenses 
income tax expense as a percentage of average earning assets was the lowest level in  but only slightly less than the percentages

dividends and accretion accrued on premier s series a preferred stock reduce net income available to common shareholders and thus reduce premier s roa 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to decrease premier return on average earning assets to and decrease its return on average total assets roa to in  net interest income as a percent of average earning assets returned to its highest level over the five year period but an increase in the provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets reduced net credit income to of average earning assets  repeating as the lowest percentage in the five year period presented 
non interest income as a percent of average earning assets dropped slightly in compared to  but non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets decreased to  the lowest level over the five year period 
the decrease in non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets is largely due to lower staff costs  data processing costs  and the elimination of conversion charges incurred in  partially offset by an increase in expenses related to other real estate owned oreo 
income tax expense as a percentage of average earning assets returned to a more normal level in  due to tax benefits realized in  and related to deferred tax assets 
also similar to and  preferred stock dividends and accretion in totaled as a percent of average earning assets 
dividends and accretion accrued on premier s series a preferred stock reduce net income available to common shareholders and thus reduce premier s roa 
substantially offsetting the reduction in net income available to common shareholders from preferred stock dividends was the a discount realized on the redemption of  shares of series preferred stock purchased during an auction conducted by the us treasury in july adding to premier s net income available to common shareholders in was as a percentage of average earning assets of income realized on the early call of two securities during the year plus a gain on the sale of a note on non accrual status 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to increase premier return on average earning assets to and increase its return on average total assets roa to 
return on average common equity roe  another measure of earnings performance  indicates the amount of net income earned in relation to the total equity invested by holders of common stock 
premier s roe was compared to in and realized in roe increased in due to the significantly higher roa in but was tempered by the lower multiple of average assets to average common equity in roe decreased in due to the significantly lower roa in and a slightly lower multiple of average assets to average common equity in

this ratio compares favorably to the net overhead ratio in  the ratio reported in and the reported in  but is still higher than the reported in  the lowest ratio reported in the last five years 
the decrease in the net overhead ratio was largely the result of lower operating expenses  primarily staff costs  data processing costs and the costs incurred in related to converting to a different data processing provider 
the expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in oreo expenses in the net overhead ratio in compared to was largely the result of a lower ratio of non interest expense to average earning assets due to operational savings  lower acquisition expenses and gains on the sale of some oreo in compared to negatively affecting the net overhead ratio was a lower ratio of non interest income to average earning assets  largely due to the lower non interest income ratio of the acquired abigail adams banks compared to the historical results of premier s other subsidiary banks 
this lower trend continued into as well as a lower level of secondary market mortgage commissions 
in  the higher net overhead ratio  when compared to  was largely the result of a higher ratio of non interest expense to average earning assets due to acquisition related expenses  significantly higher fdic insurance costs  higher oreo costs and relatively less efficient operations of the acquired abigail adams subsidiary banks

management s discussion and analysis december  balance sheet analysis summary a financial institution primary sources of revenue are generated by its earning assets  while its major expenses are produced by the funding of these assets with interest bearing liabilities 
effective management of these sources and uses of funds is essential in attaining a financial institution optimal profitability while maintaining a minimum amount of interest rate risk and credit risk 
information on rate related sources and uses of funds for each of the three years in the period ended december   is provided in the table below

management s discussion and analysis december  loan portfolio premier s loan portfolio is its largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  totaling of average earning assets during average loans decreased in by million  or  over following a million  or  increase in over the decrease in is largely due to weak loan demand during the latter half of and the first half of combined with loan payoffs resulting not only from borrowers accelerating their payments to reduce their outstanding debt  but also payoffs due to the workout of problem loans 
the decrease in average loans occurred in all of premier s markets  but particularly in the dc metro and virginia markets largely due to reductions in problem loans and in premier s kentucky market largely due to payments and payoffs on the loans acquired from the branch purchase in september average loans outstanding decreased by million  or  in premier s west virginia market and decreased by million  or  in premier s ohio market 
otherwise  average loans outstanding decreased by million  or  in premier s dc metro market  decreased by million  or  in premier s virginia market and decreased by million  or  in premier s kentucky market 
the modest increase in is again largely due to weak loan demand combined with loan payoffs resulting not only from borrowers accelerating the reduction in their outstanding debt  but also payoffs due to the workout of problem loans 
the growth in average loans in  resulted from increases in balances in premier s kentucky and ohio markets  substantially offset by decreases in average loans outstanding in premier s west virginia  dc metro and virginia markets 
in  premier realized a million  or  increase in average outstanding loans in its kentucky markets 
a significant portion of the loan growth in this market came from the full year inclusion of the loans acquired via the branch purchase in september otherwise  average loans outstanding increased by million  or  in premier s ohio markets but decreased by million  or  in premier s dc metro market  decreased by million  or  in premier s virginia markets and decreased million  or  in premier s west virginia markets 
total loans at december  increased by million  or  from the total at december  this increase follows a million  or  decrease from the total at december  the increase in is largely due to increased loan demand in the second half of during the latter half of  total loans increased by million 
the loan demand in was largely due to increases in outstanding loans in premier s dc metro market  up million  or  and its virginia market  up million  or since year end these increases offset a million  or  decrease in premier s kentucky market and a million  or  decrease in premier s ohio market 
total loans in premier s west virginia market remained at million at december  and december  the decrease in is due to decreases in loans outstanding in all of premier s markets as loan payments and payoffs exceeded demand for new loans

management s discussion and analysis december  loans secured by real estate totaled of premier s loan portfolio at december   down from the of total loans at december  the decrease is largely due to a decrease in real estate mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio 
the decrease more than offset an increase in construction and land development loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio 
in  loans secured by real estate increased from of premier s loan portfolio at december  to approximately of premier s total loan portfolio at december   largely due to an increase in commercial real estate loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio 
the increase more than offset a decrease in construction and land development loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio 
residential real estate loans  as a percentage of the total loan portfolio  remained relatively unchanged in compared to premier s residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan at the time of origination 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also originates mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market and recognizes non interest income upon the sale of those mortgages in the form of commissions and servicing release fees 
premier has not engaged in the solicitation of so called sub prime or interest only mortgages 
premier uses an experienced staff underwriter to ensure the completeness of the borrowers loan application and documentation and to ensure that the loans meet the standards required by prospective loan purchasers 
additional information regarding the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold is contained in premier s consolidated statements of cash flows presented elsewhere in this annual report 
commercial loans  including commercial real estate secured loans  are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plans 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier defined market area who are known to the local bank staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default 
in addition to the loans presented in the loan summary table  premier also offers certain off balance sheet products such as letters of credit  revolving credit agreements  and other loan commitments 
these products are offered under the same credit standards as the loan portfolio and are included in the risk based capital ratios used by the federal reserve to evaluate capital adequacy 
additional information on off balance sheet commitments is contained in

these decreases more than offset an million increase in restructured loans primarily resulting from previously restructured loans on non accrual that returned to accrual status in the increase in from year end was largely due to a million increase in loans past due days or more  a million increase in oreo and a million increase in restructured loans 
these increases more than offset the million decrease in non accrual loans 
as shown in the table above  premier experienced a significant increase in non performing assets in with the acquisition of abigail adams and its two subsidiary banks 
at december   these two banks accounted for million  or of premier s non performing assets 
at december   the same two banks from abigail adams accounted for million  or of premier s non performing assets  as an increase in non accrual loans at the two banks was substantially offset by a decrease in oreo 
at december   the operations covered by the markets of the acquired abigail adams banks accounted for million  or of premier s non performing assets 
in  premier made significant progress in reducing the overall level of the non performing assets from the operations covered by the markets of the acquired abigail adams banks 
at december   non performing assets originating from the acquired abigail adams banks decreased by million to million  or of premier s total non performing assets 
however  since these assets were recorded at an estimated fair value on the date of acquisition  the amount of credit risk assumed by premier is not nearly as great as the volume of non performing assets suggests taken at face value 
new accounting guidance adopted by premier at the beginning of does not permit an acquirer to carry over the purchased entity s allowance for loan losses 
instead  under the new accounting guidance  all acquired loans are to be recorded at their net estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value on all loans  but particularly on non performing assets  included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates included significant discounts on the non accrual loans 
these estimates required management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and are inherently uncertain 
however  since the estimated fair value of these loans was believed to have been accounted for in the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded at the date of acquisition 
at september   just prior to premier s acquisition  abigail adams reported a collective allowance for loan losses of approximately million 
in contrast  premier recorded the estimated fair value of the 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  combined loan portfolios at an estimated million discount to the contractual amounts receivable on the loans at acquisition 
these discounts  allocated per loan  will be used to offset any charge offs of the uncollectible portion of the contractual amount due on non performing assets  or accreted into interest income using a level yield method on performing loans 
should premier collect the full contractual amount due  any fair value discount would be recognized as interest income 
the following table illustrates the and year end face value and the discounted net carrying value of the non performing assets located in the two markets washington  dc and richmond  virginia added to premier s operations from the acquisition of abigail adams 
these markets were the operational territories of the former adams national bank in washington  dc and the former consolidated bank and trust in richmond  virginia  both of which were merged into premier s wholly owned subsidiary  boone county bank  to form premier bank on april  additional information on loans purchased with evidence of deteriorated credit quality is contained in

excluding the non performing assets at december  from the abigail adams acquisition  the million of non performing assets at december  is an increase of million over the same measure of non performing assets at december  the increase in is largely due to a million increase in non accrual loans  a million increase in accruing loans past due days or more  and a million increase in restructured loans 
these increases more than offset a  decrease in oreo 
most of premier s restructured loans are loans that have been modified to allow the borrower to pay interest only for a limited amount of time 
although loans may be classified as non performing  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than originally contracted terms 
during  approximately million of interest income was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  including approximately million from the recognition of purchase discounts upon loan payoff  while approximately million would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms

management s discussion and analysis december  management believes the estimated potential losses related to delinquent loans to be adequately provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
these non performing assets were included in the analyses that supported the recording of provisions for loan loss during  and as management efforts to collect on all of the company s non performing assets continue  matured loans are only renewed using premier strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceedings begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
as previously demonstrated by premier s history  management is committed to continuing to reduce its level of non performing assets and maintaining strong underwriting standards to help maintain a lower level of non performing assets in the future 
premier collection efforts at affiliate banks in and were masked by the high level of non performing assets at its farmers deposit bank subsidiary  which alone totaled million at december  at december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million  leaving million of total non performing assets at the other affiliate banks combined 
by december   total non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million 
this experience and performance in pursuing the collection of non performing assets was a factor in management s decision to pursue the acquisition of abigail adams and its high level of non performing assets 
while the circumstances related to the collection of every non performing loan are different  with the benefit of the additional capital provided by premier s participation in the tarp capital purchase program and the requirement to record the non performing assets at their estimated fair value at acquisition date  management believes it will be successful in resolving a majority of the non performing assets acquired from abigail adams 
the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
other than these loans and the impaired loans discussed in 
note to the consolidated financial statements  premier does not have a significant volume of loans where management has serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms of the loan 
it is premier policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
premier has million of construction and land development loans on non accrual status at december  whereby additional funds may be needed by the borrower to complete the project 
for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends  less estimated disposal costs 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations

management s discussion and analysis december  during  premier recorded million of writedowns of oreo properties that were partially offset by  of gains on the disposition of oreo properties  resulting in a net expense in of  this expense compares to  of oreo writedowns in which were more than offset by million of gains on the disposition of oreo properties  resulting in a  net reduction in operating expense 
during  premier realized  net reduction in operation expense as  of oreo writedowns were more than offset by  of gains on the disposition of oreo 
the gains realized in are largely due to sales of oreo properties acquired via the abigail adams acquisition 
real estate values in and around washington  dc have improved in compared to when abigail adams was acquired 
the writedowns on oreo that were recorded in were largely due to two repossessed construction projects where the costs incurred to complete the projects have exceeded original estimates and the properties were adjusted to net realizable value 
the net gains realized in are largely due to sales of oreo properties acquired via the abigail adams acquisition 
real estate values in and around washington  dc improved in and compared to furthermore  premier spent funds on repairing or completing certain oreo properties prior to their sale  improving the properties salability and market value 
similar to  the net gains realized in are largely due to sales of oreo properties acquired via the abigail adams acquisition which had improved values at the time of sale  or were properties where premier spent funds on repairing or completing certain properties prior to their sale 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are more likely to be classified as impaired 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions

management s discussion and analysis december  a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial conditions and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed  assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower

events that may lead to negative provisions include greater than anticipated recoveries  a reduction in the historical loss ratios  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  although total loans outstanding increased by million in  the increase in the ratio to was largely due to the million of provision for loan losses in exceeding the million of net charge offs  adding million to the allowance for loan losses at year end 
the percentage increase in the allowance for loan losses exceed the percentage increase in loans outstanding resulting in the higher ratio at december  the increase in the level of provision expense in was largely due to increases in specific reserves on loans already identified as impaired and also due to specific reserves on loans newly identified as impaired during at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  the increase in the ratio of the allowance to total loans in was largely the result of a million decrease in total loans at december  the million of provision for loan losses in was slightly offset by million of net charge offs

management s discussion and analysis december  recorded in  reducing the allowance by approximately  the increase in the level of provision expense during was largely to provide for a calculated increase in exposure to credit risk related to one borrowing relationship in premier s kentucky market identified during the second quarter 
the loan was eventually charged off in the fourth quarter of while premier is continuing to pursue available collection remedies  management determined that the borrowing relationship should be charged off in accordance with the company s loan policies and procedures 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  the increase in the ratio of the allowance to total loans in was the result of million of additional provisions for loan losses exceeding the million of net charge offs 
the additional provisions for loan losses recorded in were largely due to million of provisions recorded for loans acquired from abigail adams as loans were reanalyzed for impairment throughout the year 
the remaining banks recorded a collective provision for loan losses of million in  which is similar to the provision recorded by these banks in a summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above

the level of additional provisions increased in to provide for estimated loan impairment  primarily as additional loans from the acquisition of abigail adams were downgraded and analyzed for impairment 
the increase in the level of provision expense during was largely to provide for a calculated increase in exposure to credit risk related to one borrowing relationship in premier s kentucky market identified during the second quarter

note to the consolidated financial statements 
premier aggressively pursues past due loans in an effort to bring those loans back to current status 
if these efforts fail and a past due loan becomes a non performing loan  premier s policies for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are used to determine the estimated potential loss on the loan 
future provisions to the allowance for loan losses  positive or negative  will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans

premier continues to make a significant effort to reduce its past due and non performing loans by reviewing loan files  using the courts to bring borrowers current with the terms of their loan agreements and or the foreclosure and sale of oreo properties 
as in the past  when these plans are executed  premier may experience increases in non performing loans and non performing assets

management s discussion and analysis december  investment portfolio and other earning assets investment securities averaged million in  up million  or  from the million averaged in this increase follows a million  or  increase in from the million averaged in the increase during is largely attributable to weak loan demand 
during  as loan payments and payoffs exceeded the demand for new loans  some of the proceeds from the loan payments were invested in investment securities 
this was especially true during the first half of likewise  the increase during is largely attributable to the growth in funding from non interest bearing deposits coupled with weak loan demand 
also contributing to the increase in average investments in was the use of lower yielding  interest bearing bank balances and federal funds sold to purchase investment securities 
investment securities are highly liquid and generally have a greater yield than interest bearing bank balances or federal funds sold 
however their longer investment term generally results in greater interest rate risk over other short term investments 
this was believed to be especially true in and  as management continued to invest based on a belief that market interest rates were at their lowest level and that buying longer term investments would have the effect of locking in these lowest interest rates over the life of the investments 
due to the low interest rate environment during and continuing throughout  issuers of investment securities were routinely invoking call features within their securities and reissuing new bonds at lower coupon rates 
during  million of premier s investment securities were either called or matured compared to million during to offset some of the effects of interest rate risk in the investment portfolio  premier purchased collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s issued by the government national mortgage association gnma  also known as ginnie mae 
these cmo s are similar to us treasury bonds in that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government  but unlike us treasury bonds  return a portion of the principal each month coinciding with the monthly principal payments made by mortgage borrowers collateralizing the securities 
it is the monthly return of principal that will allow premier to take advantage of any rise in market interest rates by investing the principal payments in future higher yielding securities long before the final maturity date of the cmo 
an added feature of these gnma cmo s is that the securities are not subject to early call provisions 
only the mortgagees prepayment of their underlying mortgages can accelerate the principal reduction on the investment security 
thus  the purchase yield is not as susceptible to downward interest rate risks as investment securities with call features 
this benefit is illustrated by the lower amount of premier s securities that were either called or matured in and during  million of investments were called or matured including principal payments on cmo s and mortgage backed securities and during  million of investments were called or matured compared to million during 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  at december  the amount of investments totaled million  up million or from the million of investments at december  the increase in investments is largely due to the utilization of premier s more liquid yet lower yielding interest bearing bank balances and federal funds sold  both of which have decreased since december  the increase in follows a million  or increase in from the balance of investments at december  the increase in investments in is largely due to additional funds from loan payments and payoffs exceeding the demand for new loans 
much of these funds were reinvested in investment securities rather than held in interest bearing bank balances

based upon analyses of asset liability repricing  interest rate forecasts  and liquidity requirements  funds are periodically reinvested in high quality debt securities  which typically mature over a longer period of time 
at the time of purchase  management determines whether the securities will be classified as trading  available for sale  or held to maturity

management s discussion and analysis december  premier s average investment in federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances decreased in compared to this decrease follows a decrease in averaging million in  federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances decreased million from the million in the decrease in reflects the utilization of some of these funds to repay premier s million of fhlb debt upon maturity in  to purchase additional investment securities and satisfy deposit withdrawals 
the decrease in reflects the migration of some of premier s most highly liquid yet lowest yielding assets into higher yielding investment securities 
as shown in the consolidated average balance sheets and net interest income analysis above  on average  the yield on federal funds sold dropped to in and and rose slightly to in in accordance with the federal reserve s board of governors policy to maintain the federal funds rate between and 
to obtain higher yields on its most highly liquid funds  in premier began shifting some of its federal funds sold to certificates of deposits with other banks and other interest bearing bank balances  primarily with the federal reserve bank  which yielded  on average  in and in this practice continued in and as the yield on interest bearing bank balances averaged in and in  far exceeding the yield on average federal funds sold 
the average balance of federal funds sold decreased by million in to million  while average interest bearing bank balances decreased by million in to million 
the majority of these interest bearing bank balances are held at federal reserve banks 
yields on federal funds sold rise and fall in direct correlation with interest rate changes made by the federal reserve board in establishing national economic policy 
investment security yields are based on a number of pricing factors  including but not limited to coupon rate  time to maturity and issuer credit quality 
fluctuations in the amount of federal funds sold and other short term investments reflect management goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure  as discussed in greater detail above and in other sections of this report 
funding sources in response to the federal reserve policy to reduce market interest rates by lowering the targeted federal funds rate  in premier began cutting its rates paid on its interest bearing deposits 
this change follows a three year period during which premier was raising the rates paid on its interest bearing deposits in response to the increase in market interest rates 
as a result  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  down from the paid in  and the paid in the basis point decrease in was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on certificates of deposits and other time deposits  which made up of the total average interest bearing liabilities in other rate decreases on deposits in include a basis point decrease on savings deposits and a basis point decrease on now and money market accounts 
similarly  in  premier decreased the rate paid on its short term borrowings  primarily repurchase agreements with deposit customers  by basis points

the company s fhlb advances were fixed rate borrowings and thus yields increase or decrease usually as a result of payments and maturities

in  all remaining fhlb advances were repaid at maturity 
the effect was an increase in the average rate paid to countering the trend of lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities in was the average rate paid on other borrowings  which increased basis points to in the average rate paid on other borrowings decreased only slightly to in increasing the overall rate paid on other borrowings was the million borrowed from the bankers bank of kentucky bankers bank on september  the new borrowing has a minimum interest rate of 
the proceeds were used to refinance million of existing debt with the bankers bank and to inject million of capital into premier s subsidiary bank  citizens deposit bank  to facilitate the bank s purchase of four branches from integra bank 
the effect of this new borrowing was to increase the average rate paid in to 
at the end of  premier converted its largest dollar borrowing at the time  the million owed to first guaranty bank  to a fixed rate of interest of through its remaining maturity date on april  the fixed rate was slightly higher than the variable rate paid on the borrowing  but as a fixed rate  the interest rate would not increase until maturity 
as premier reduced the principal on the higher rate banker s bank borrowing at a faster rate than the borrowing from first guaranty bank  the average rate paid on other borrowings decreased in by basis points 
due to alternative sources of investment and an ever increasing sophistication of customers in funds management techniques to maximize return on their money  competition for funds has become more intense 
other financial institutions that compete in local markets with premier that have a need to increase liquidity offer special above market rate deposit products to attract additional funds 
premier banks periodically offer special rate products to retain their deposit base or attract additional deposits 
premier s deposits  on average  decreased by million  or  in following a million or increase in from average deposits 
the decrease in average deposits is partially due to the full year impact of the withdrawal of million of funds by the district of columbia government reported in the second quarter of local government 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  deposits are typically volatile deposits  as local governments routinely seek higher returns on their deposit accounts 
average non interest bearing deposits decreased by million  or  in another factor in premier s decrease in average total deposits in was the continuing decrease in rates paid on certificates of deposit 
customers shopping for higher yielding certificates of deposit withdrew their funds upon maturity  while other customers deposited their maturing certificate of deposit funds in interest bearing transaction accounts keeping their funds readily available rather than investing in a new certificate of deposit over a longer time frame 
in  average certificates of deposit and other time deposits decreased by  or million  to million 
partially offsetting this decrease  average money market and other interest bearing transaction oriented deposits increased by  or million  in while average savings deposits increased by  or million 
the combined decrease in average interest bearing deposit balances in was  or million 
the increase in average deposits is primarily attributable to the full year impact of the million of deposits assumed via the branch purchase in september this increase in deposits more than offset the withdrawal of million of funds by the district of columbia government reported in the second quarter of in  average money market and other interest bearing transaction oriented deposits decreased by million  or  while average savings deposits increased by million  or and average non interest bearing deposits increased by million  or 
in  average certificates of deposit and other time deposits remained relatively unchanged  increasing by only or million  to million 
in  average non interest bearing deposits totaled million  a million or increase from the average in the increase in includes the benefit of the full year inclusion of the non interest bearing deposits assumed from the branch purchase in september as well as increases recorded at each of the affiliate banks 
since no interest is paid on these deposits  an increase in non interest bearing deposits helps to increase premier net interest margin and its profitability 
non interest bearing deposits are more susceptible to withdrawal and therefore may provide challenges to maintaining adequate liquidity 

see the additional discussion on liquidity below 
most customers are still keeping their maturity choices short in order to take advantage of possible higher interest rates in the future 
while offering some special certificate of deposit rates to remain competitive  premier continues to focus on building its base of customer relationships by offering more convenient electronic banking products to its non interest bearing deposit customers

premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model developed by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates from and basis points  but never below zero 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects that net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier alco guidelines 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide as well as actual results for premier 
the unique characteristics of premier loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier deposits and borrowings 
premier deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier net assets

capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio increased to during  an increase from the during and the average equity to asset ratio in the ratios for all three years are considered adequate for a company of premier s size

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  during the third quarter of the increase in over was the result of a higher percentage increase in average equity  primarily from the generation of million of retained net income  exceeding the percentage growth in average assets 
also increasing average equity in was an increase in the market value of investments from a million net unrealized loss at the end of to a million net unrealized gain at the end of the federal reserve risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s capital to risk adjusted asset ratio was  compared to at december  and at december  all three of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets  net of any related deferred taxes as permitted 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was equal to the at december  and higher than the at december  all three of these ratios are above the to ratios recommended by the federal reserve 
the leverage ratio remained unchanged at december   due to the very small change in total assets and total stockholders equity since year end while preferred stockholders equity decreased in due to the redemption of  shares of premier s series a preferred stock  this equity was replaced by premier s earnings performance in  net of any dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders 
similarly  premier s capital to risk adjusted assets ratio changed little in  increasing to at december  from at december   as total stockholders equity changed very little from year end the increase in the ratio was largely due to a decrease in premier s risk adjusted assets at december  the increase in the leverage ratio during was a combined result of a decrease in total assets  an increase in total stockholders equity and a decrease in the amounts of goodwill and other intangibles that are subtracted from stockholders equity by regulation 
similarly  the increase in the capital to risk adjusted assets ratio in is the combined result of a decrease in risk adjusted assets  as premier increased its holdings of less riskier liquid assets and kept more of those liquid assets in interest bearing deposit accounts with the federal reserve which are given a zero percent risk factor  along with the increase in total capital 
premier capital ratios are the direct result of management desire to maintain a strong capital position 
this strong capital position tends to have a dampening effect on the key performance ratio return on average equity roe due to the higher level of capital maintained

management s discussion and analysis december  income statement analysis net interest income net interest income  the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense associated with funding those assets  is premier s most significant component of earnings 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million in  down from the million earned in  which follows a increase in from when net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  interest income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by the amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutory federal tax rate of for companies of premier size 
the decrease in net interest income in is largely the result of the combined decrease in interest income on loans and investments exceeding the combined decrease in interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  in  interest income on loans decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the average volume of loans outstanding in this decrease was offset slightly by an increase in interest income on loans due to a higher overall yield on the loan portfolio 
the net result was a million decrease in interest income on loans when compared to in contrast  interest income on investments decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the average yield earned on the portfolio of securities 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest income on investments due to a higher average volume of investments outstanding in the net result was an  decrease in interest income on investments when compared to also  as shown in the table below  interest expense on deposits decreased in total by million  largely due to interest expense savings on certificates of deposit 
interest expense decreased by  as a result of a lower average volume of certificates of deposit in interest expense also decreased by  due to a lower overall rate paid on those deposits in interest expense on now and money market accounts as well as savings accounts decreased by  in total as interest savings from lower rates paid on those transaction based deposits more than offset an increase in interest expense resulting from a higher volume of both now and money market deposits as well as savings account deposits 
premier also realized  of interest expense savings on its short term borrowings  largely due to lower rates paid on these borrowings but also due to a lower average balance during premier realized  of interest expense savings on other borrowed funds  largely due to principal reductions during the year  and  of interest expense savings on fhlb borrowings due to repaying the borrowings upon maturity in the first half of the combined effect was to decrease net interest income by  in the increase in net interest income in is largely the result of savings on interest paid on certificates of deposit exceeding a decrease in interest income on loans

also  as shown in the table below  interest expense on deposits in increased by only  as a result of changes in the volume in interest bearing deposits  as the increase in interest expense from the increase in the average volume of certificates of deposit and savings deposits was substantially offset by the decrease in interest expense from the decrease in the average volume of now and money market deposit accounts 
however  due to lower rates paid on certificates of deposit in  premier saved million of interest expense  more than offsetting the increase in interest expense due to the higher volume of average interest bearing liabilities and the decrease in interest income from loans and investment securities described above 
combined with the interest savings from lower rates on savings deposits  premier reduced interest expense on deposit accounts by million in premier also realized  of interest expense savings on its short term borrowings  largely due to lower rates paid  and  of interest expense savings on its fhlb borrowings due to the maturities of its highest rate borrowings in partially offsetting these savings in was a  increase in interest expense paid on other borrowed funds at the parent company due to the increase in the volume of borrowed funds from the september borrowing from bankers bank and that borrowing s overall higher interest cost

non interest income and expense non interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving profitability 
recognizing this importance  management continues to evaluate areas where non interest income can be enhanced 
nevertheless  key sources of premier s non interest income have diminished  in part  due to increased government regulation making the selling of fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market more difficult and limiting the number of overdraft charges that can be assessed on a customer s account on a given day 
as shown in the table of non interest income and expense below  total fees and other income decreased by  or  in in  service charges on deposit accounts decreased by  or  due to lower revenue from monthly account charges on consumer checking accounts as well as lower overall revenue from consumer overdraft charges

the increase in was largely due to increases in electronic banking income and other non interest income partially offset by decreases in service charges on deposit accounts and secondary market mortgage income

effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one effect is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report
