overview we are a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in middle market privately held companies 
we are a closed end investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company under the investment company act of  or the act 
we invest primarily in senior and subordinated debt and equity of companies in need of capital for acquisitions  divestitures  growth  development and recapitalization 
we work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows  asset collateral or contracted pro forma cash flows 
we currently have seven origination strategies in which we make investments lending in private equity sponsored transactions  lending directly to companies not owned by private equity firms  control investments in corporate operating companies  control investments in financial companies  investments in structured credit  real estate investments  and investments in syndicated debt 
we continue to evaluate other origination strategies in the ordinary course of business with no specific tops down allocation to any single origination strategy 
lending in private equity sponsored transactions we make loans to companies which are controlled by leading private equity firms 
this debt can take the form of first lien  second lien  unitranche or mezzanine loans 
in making these investments  we look for a diversified customer base  recurring demand for the product or service  barriers to entry  strong historical cash flow and experienced management teams 
these loans typically have significant equity subordinate to our loan position 
this strategy has represented approximately of our business 
lending directly to companies we provide debt financing to companies owned by non private equity firms  the company founder  a management team or a family 
here  in addition to the strengths we look for in a sponsored transaction  we also look for the alignment with the management team with significant invested capital 
this strategy often has less competition than the private equity sponsor strategy because such company financing needs are not easily addressed by banks and often require more diligence preparation 
direct lending can result in higher returns and lower leverage than sponsor transactions and may include warrants or equity to us 
this strategy generally has comprised approximately of our business 
control investments in corporate operating companies this strategy involves acquiring controlling stakes in non financial operating companies 
our investments in these companies are generally structured as a combination of yield producing debt and equity 
we provide certainty of closure to our counterparties  give the seller personal liquidity and generally look for management to continue on in their current roles 
this strategy has comprised approximately of our business 
control investments in financial companies this strategy involves acquiring controlling stakes in financial companies  including consumer direct lending  subprime auto lending and other strategies 
our investments in these companies are generally structured as a combination of yield producing debt and equity 
these investments are often structured in a tax efficient ric compliant partnership  enhancing returns 
this strategy has comprised approximately of our business 

table of contents investments in structured credit we make investments in clos  generally taking a significant position in the subordinated interests equity of the clos 
the clos include a diversified portfolio of broadly syndicated loans and do not have direct exposure to real estate  mortgages  sub prime debt  or consumer based debt 
the clos in which we invest are managed by top tier collateral managers that have been thoroughly diligenced prior to investment 
this strategy has represented of the portfolio 
real estate investments we make investments in real estate through our wholly owned tax efficient reit  aphc 
our real estate investments are in various classes of fully developed and occupied real estate properties that generate current yields 
we seek to identify properties that have historically high occupancy and steady cash flow generation 
we partner with established property managers with experience in managing the property type to manage such properties after acquisition 
this is a more recent investment strategy that has represented less than of our business 
investments in syndicated debt on an opportunistic basis  we make investments in loans and high yield bonds that have been sold to a syndicate of buyers 
here we look for investments with attractive risk adjusted returns after we have completed a fundamental credit analysis 
these investments are purchased with a long term  buy and hold outlook and we look to provide significant structuring input by providing anchoring orders 
this strategy has represented approximately of the portfolio 
we invest primarily in first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt  which in some cases includes an equity component 
first and second lien senior loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt of a given portfolio company 
these loans also have the benefit of security interests on the assets of the portfolio company  which may rank ahead of or be junior to other security interests 
mezzanine debt and our investments in clos are subordinated to senior loans and are generally unsecured 
we invest in debt and equity positions of clos which are a form of securitization in which the cash flows of a portfolio of loans are pooled and passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches 
our clo investments are derived from portfolios of corporate debt securities which are generally risk rated from bb to b depending on the tranche 
we seek to be a long term investor with our portfolio companies 
the aggregate value of our portfolio investments was  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
during the year ended june   our net cost of investments increased by  or  as a result of new investments  follow on investments and several revolver advances of  accrued of payment in kind interest of  structuring fees of  and amortization of discounts and premiums of  while we received full repayment on investments  sold ten investments  impaired one investment  and received several partial prepayments  amortization payments and a revolver repayment  totaling compared to the end of last fiscal year ended june   net assets increased by  or during the year ended june   from  to  this increase resulted from the issuance of new shares of our common stock less offering costs in the amount of  dividend reinvestments of  and  from operations 
these increases  in turn  were offset by  in dividend distributions to our stockholders 
the  increase in net assets resulting from operations is net of the following net investment income of  net realized loss on investments of  and a decrease in net assets due to changes in net unrealized depreciation of investments of  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ  and these differences could be material

table of contents investment valuation in determining the fair value of our portfolio investments at june   the audit committee considered valuations from the independent valuation firms and from management having an aggregate range of  to  excluding money market investments 
in determining the range of value for debt instruments  management and the independent valuation firms generally shadow rated the investment and then based upon the range of ratings  determined appropriate yields to maturity for a loan rated as such 
a discounted cash flow analysis was then prepared using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate  yielding the ranges 
for equity investments  the enterprise value was determined by applying ebitda multiples for similar recent investment sales 
for stressed equity investments  a liquidation analysis was prepared 
in determining the range of value for our investments in clos  management and the independent valuation firms used discounted cash flow models 
the valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the clo deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view 
for each security  the most appropriate valuation approach was chosen from alternative approaches to ensure the most accurate valuation for each security 
a discounted cash flow model is prepared  utilizing a waterfall engine to store the collateral data  generate collateral cash flows from the assets  and distributes the cash flow to the liability structure based on the payment priorities  and discount them back using proper discount rates that incorporate all the risk factors 
the board of directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to value the asset including recent operating and financial trends for the asset  independent ratings obtained from third parties  comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry and discounted cash flow models for our investments in clos 
the composite of all these analyses  applied to each investment  was a total valuation of  excluding money market investments 
our portfolio companies are generally lower middle market companies  outside of the financial sector  with less than  of annual ebitda 
we believe our market has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments 
control investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments 
operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter 
significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment 
several control investments in our portfolio are under enhanced scrutiny by our senior management and our board of directors and are discussed below

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
basis of consolidation under the act rules  the regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x and the american institute of certified public accountants audit and accounting guide for investment companies  we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services and benefits to us 
our financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of pcf  our only wholly owned  closely managed subsidiary that is also an investment company 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
investment classification we are a non diversified company within the meaning of the act 
we classify our investments by level of control 
as defined in the act  control investments are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company 
control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within days or less  a beneficial ownership of or more of the voting securities of an investee company 
affiliated investments and affiliated companies are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within days or less  beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person 
investments are recognized when we assume an obligation to acquire a financial instrument and assume the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument 
investments are derecognized when we 
table of contents assume an obligation to sell a financial instrument and forego the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument 
specifically  we record all security transactions on a trade date basis 
investments in other  non security financial instruments are recorded on the basis of subscription date or redemption date  as applicable 
amounts for investments recognized or derecognized but not yet settled are reported as receivables for investments sold and payables for investments purchased  respectively  in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities 
investment valuation to value our assets  we follow the guidance of asc that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or america  or gaap  and requires disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by the company at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
asc applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by other standards 
in accordance with asc  the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted 
our board of directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio 
these procedures are detailed below 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
for most of our investments  market quotations are not available 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors  the independent valuation firms conduct independent appraisals and make their own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation of the investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firms  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the investment adviser  the respective independent valuation firm and the audit committee 

table of contents investments are valued utilizing a shadow bond approach  a market approach  an income approach  a liquidation approach  or a combination of approaches  as appropriate 
the shadow bond and market approaches use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities including a business 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  cash flows or earnings to a single present value amount discounted calculated based on an appropriate discount rate 
the measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
in following these approaches  the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include  as relevant available current market data  including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and multiples  security covenants  call protection provisions  information rights  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company ability to make payments  its earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public  m a comparables  the principal market and enterprise values  among other factors 
our investments in clos are classified as asc level securities  and are valued using discounted cash flow model 
the valuations have been accomplished through the analysis of the clo deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view 
for each security  the most appropriate valuation approach has been chosen from alternative approaches to ensure the most accurate valuation for each security 
to value a clo  both the assets and liabilities of the clo capital structure need be modeled 
we use a waterfall engine to store the collateral data  generate collateral cash flows from the assets  and distributes the cash flow to the liability structure based on the payment priorities  and discount them back using proper discount rates that incorporate all the risk factors 
the main risk factors are default risk  interest rate risk  downgrade risk  and credit spread risk 
for a discussion of the risks inherent in determining the value of securities for which readily available market values do not exist  see risk factors risks relating to our business most of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith under the direction of our board of directors and  as a result  there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments 
valuation of other financial assets and financial liabilities asc subtopic  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities asc permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
we have elected not to value some assets and liabilities at fair value as would be permitted by asc federal and state income taxes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code of the code  applicable to regulated investment companies 
we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute or retain through a deemed distribution all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders  therefore  we have made no provision for income taxes 
the character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from gaap 
book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid in capital 
if we do not distribute at least of our annual income and of our capital gains in the calendar year earned  we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains exceeds the distributions 
table of contents from such taxable income for the year 
to the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income  we accrue excise taxes  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate 
the annual effective excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income 
for the calendar year ended december   we elected to retain a portion of our annual taxable income and have paid  for the excise tax due with the filing of the return 
as of june   we have  accrued as an estimate of two quarters of the excise tax due for the calendar year ending december  if we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a ric in any taxable year  we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders  nor would we be required to make distributions 
distributions would generally be taxable to our individual and other non corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  provided certain holding period and other requirements are met 
subject to certain limitations under the code  corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
to qualify again to be taxed as a ric in a subsequent year  we would be required to distribute to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non ric years reduced by an interest charge of of such earnings and profits payable by us as an additional tax 
in addition  if we failed to qualify as a ric for a period greater than two taxable years  then  in order to qualify as a ric in a subsequent year  we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built in gain the excess of aggregate gain  including items of income  over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated or  alternatively  be subject to taxation on such built in gain recognized for a period of ten years 
we adopted fasb asc  income taxes asc 
asc provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized  measured  presented  and disclosed in the financial statements 
asc requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year 
adoption of asc was applied to all open tax years as of july  the adoption of asc did not have an effect on our net asset value  financial condition or results of operations as there was no liability for unrecognized tax benefits and no change to our beginning net asset value 
as of june  and for the year then ended  we did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits 
management determinations regarding asc may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including  but not limited to  an on going analysis of tax laws  regulations and interpretations thereof 
revenue recognition realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method 
interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination  closing and commitment fees are recorded as interest income 
interest income from investments in the equity class of security of clo funds typically income notes or subordinated notes is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected 
table of contents maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with asc  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
we monitor the expected cash inflows from our clo equity investments  including the expected residual payments and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically 
loans are placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected 
unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management judgment 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in management judgment  are likely to remain current 
as of june   approximately of our net assets are in non accrual status 
dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
structuring fees and similar fees are recognized as income as earned  usually when paid 
structuring fees  excess deal deposits  net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other income 
dividends and distributions dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex dividend date 
the amount  if any  to be paid as a dividend or distribution is approved by our board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon our management estimate of our earnings for the quarter 
net realized capital gains  if any  are distributed at least annually 
financing costs we record origination expenses related to our credit facility and senior notes as deferred financing costs 
these expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight line method for our revolving credit facility and the effective interest method for our senior notes  over the respective expected life 
we record registration expenses related to shelf filings as prepaid assets 
these expenses consist principally of securities and exchange commission sec registration fees  legal fees and accounting fees incurred 
these prepaid assets will be charged to capital upon the receipt of an equity offering proceeds or charged to expense if no offering completed 
guarantees and indemnification agreements we follow asc  guarantees asc 
asc elaborates on the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  for those guarantees that are covered by asc  the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees 
per share information net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations per common share are calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period presented 
in accordance with asc  financial services investment companies  convertible securities are not considered in the calculation of net assets per share 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu 
asu amends topic  fair value measurements  asc by clarifying that the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts only apply to measuring the fair value of non financial assets  allowing a reporting entity to measure the fair value of the net asset or net liability position in a manner consistent with how market participants would price the net risk position  if certain criteria are met  providing a framework for considering whether a premium or discount can be applied in a fair value measurement  providing that the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity shareholders equity is estimated from the perspective of a market participant that holds the identical item as an asset  and expanding the qualitative and quantitative fair value disclosure requirements 
the expanded disclosures include  for level items  a description of the valuation process and a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those inputs if a change in those inputs would result in a significantly different fair value measurement 
asu also requires disclosures about the highest and best use of a non financial asset when this use differs from the asset current use and the reasons for such a difference 
in addition  this asu amends asc  fair value measurements  to require disclosures to include any transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
these amendments were effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of the amended guidance in asu did not have a significant effect on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price risk 
some of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the twelve months ended june   we did not engage in hedging activities
