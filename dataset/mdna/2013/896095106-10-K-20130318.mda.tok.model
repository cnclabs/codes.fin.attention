restricted equity securities restricted equity securities were  at december  and  at december  the entire balance of restricted equity securities at december  and december  represents the bank s investment in the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb 
the decrease of  is attributable to the redemption of  of fhlb stock 
fhlb stock is carried at par and does not have a readily determinable fair value 
while technically these are considered equity securities  there is no market for the fhlb stock 
therefore  the shares are considered as restricted investment securities 
management periodically evaluates fhlb stock for other than temporary impairment 
management s determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value 
the determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of cost is influenced by criteria such as the significance of any decline in net assets of the fhlb as compared to the capital stock amount for the fhlb and the length of time this situation has persisted  commitments by the fhlb to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the fhlb  the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and  accordingly  the customer base of the fhlb  and the liquidity position of the fhlb 
as a member of the fhlb system  the company is required to maintain a minimum level of investment in fhlb stock based on specific percentages of its outstanding mortgages  total assets  or fhlb advances 
the company may request redemption at par value of any stock in excess of the minimum required investment 
stock redemptions are at the discretion of the fhlb

the majority of the bank s loans are direct loans made to individuals  farmers and local businesses 
the bank relies substantially on local promotional activity and personal contacts by bank officers  directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions 
the bank makes loans to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose  a viable repayment source and a plan of repayment established at inception and generally backed by a secondary source of repayment

asset quality and nonperforming assets nonperforming assets loans originated by the company  ie  not purchased or acquired in a business combination  are referred to as originated loans 
originated loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding  net of deferred loan fees and costs 
loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred  and the net amount is amortized as an adjustment of the related loan s yield over the actual life of the loan 
originated loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans 
originated loans are placed in nonaccrual status when reasonable doubt exists as to the full  timely collection of interest or principal  or a loan becomes contractually past due by days or more with respect to interest or principal and is not well secured and in the process of collection 
when an originated loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed 
income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and where the future collection of principal is probable 
interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when  in the judgment of management  the loan is estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest 

table of contents an allowance for loan losses for originated loans is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
originated loans and deposit related overdrafts are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely or  with respect to consumer installment loans  according to an established delinquency schedule 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in existing loans and leases  based on evaluations of the collectability  impairment and prior loss experience of loans and leases 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
the company defines an originated loan as impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired originated loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance 
in situations related to originated loans where  for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties  the company grants a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to the borrower that the company would not otherwise consider  the related loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
the company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify to more affordable terms before their loan reaches nonaccrual status 
these modified terms may include rate reductions  principal forgiveness  payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral 
in cases where the company grants the borrower new terms that result in the loan being classified as a tdr  the company measures any impairment on the restructuring as noted above for impaired loans 
tdr loans are classified as impaired until they are fully paid off or charged off 
loans that are in nonaccrual status at the time they become tdr loans  remain in nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance which the company generally believes to be six consecutive months of payments  or equivalent 
otherwise  tdr loans are subject to the same nonaccrual and charge off policies as noted above with respect to their restructured principal balance 
credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the company s originated loan portfolio 
this is maintained through periodic charges to earnings 
these charges are included in the consolidated statements of income as provision for loan losses 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
however  for a variety of reasons  not all losses are immediately known to the company and  of those that are known  the full extent of the loss may not be quantifiable at that point in time 
the balance of the company s allowance for originated loan losses is meant to be an estimate of these unknown but probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
the company formally assesses the adequacy of the allowance for originated loan losses on a quarterly basis 
determination of the adequacy is based on ongoing assessments of the probable risk in the outstanding originated loan portfolio  and to a lesser extent the company s originated loan commitments 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of credits based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  growth of the portfolio as a whole or by segment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are re graded as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower  when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of nonpayment  or if they become delinquent 
re grading of larger problem loans occurs at least quarterly 
confirmation of the quality of the grading process is obtained by independent credit reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
the company s method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for originated loan losses includes specific allowances for impaired originated loans and leases  formula allowance factors for pools of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  interest rates  growth  economic conditions  etc allowance factors for loan pools were based on historical loss experience by product type and prior risk rating 
during the three months ended march   management changed some of the assumptions utilized in the allowance for loan losses estimate calculation 
these changes were intended to more accurately reflect the current risk in the loan portfolio and to better estimate the losses inherent but not yet quantifiable 
these changes included the conversion to a historical loss migration analysis intended to better determine the appropriate formula reserve ratio by loan category and risk rating  the addition of an environmental factor related to the delinquency rate of loans not classified as impaired by loan category  the elimination of an unspecified reserve allocation previously intended to account for imprecision inherent in the overall calculation  and the reclassification of risk rating of certain consumer loans based on current credit score in an attempt to better identify the risk in the portfolio 
the financial effect of these changes resulted in a net reduction in the calculated allowance for loan losses of  during the three months ended march  allowances for impaired loans are based on analysis of individual credits 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the originated loan portfolio as a whole 
the allowance for originated loans is included in the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents loans purchased or acquired in a business combination are referred to as acquired loans 
acquired loans are valued as of acquisition date in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  business combinations 
loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are referred to as purchased credit impaired pci loans 
pci loans are accounted for under fasb asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
under fasb asc topic and fasb asc topic  pci loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition date  factoring in credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
accordingly  an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded as of the acquisition date 
fair value is defined as the present value of the future estimated principal and interest payments of the loan  with the discount rate used in the present value calculation representing the estimated effective yield of the loan 
default rates  loss severity  and prepayment speed assumptions are periodically reassessed and our estimate of future payments is adjusted accordingly 
the difference between contractual future payments and estimated future payments is referred to as the nonaccretable difference 
the difference between estimated future payments and the present value of the estimated future payments is referred to as the accretable yield 
the accretable yield represents the amount that is expected to be recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
if after acquisition  the company determines that the estimated future cash flows of a pci loan are expected to be more than the originally estimated  an increase in the discount rate effective yield would be made such that the newly increased accretable yield would be recognized  on a level yield basis  over the remaining estimated life of the loan 
if  after acquisition  the company determines that the estimated future cash flows of a pci loan are expected to be less than the previously estimated  the discount rate would first be reduced until the present value of the reduced cash flow estimate equals the previous present value however  the discount rate may not be lowered below its original level at acquisition 
if the discount rate has been lowered to its original level and the present value has not been sufficiently lowered  an allowance for loan loss would be established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to decrease the present value to the required level 
if the estimated cash flows improve after an allowance has been established for a loan  the allowance may be partially or fully reversed depending on the improvement in the estimated cash flows 
only after the allowance has been fully reversed may the discount rate be increased 
pci loans are put on nonaccrual status when cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated 
pci loans on nonaccrual status are accounted for using the cost recovery method or cash basis method of income recognition 
pci loans are charged off when evidence suggests cash flows are not recoverable 
foreclosed assets from pci loans are recorded in foreclosed assets at fair value with the fair value at time of foreclosure representing cash flow from the loan 
asc allows pci loans with similar risk characteristics and acquisition time frame to be pooled and have their cash flows aggregated as if they were one loan 
the company elected to use the pooled method of asc for pci other loans in the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of granite community bank granite and citizens bank of northern california citizens 
acquired loans that are not pci loans are referred to as purchased not credit impaired pnci loans 
pnci loans are accounted for under fasb asc topic  receivables nonrefundable fees and other costs  in which interest income is accrued on a level yield basis for performing loans 
for income recognition purposes  this method assumes that all contractual cash flows will be collected  and no allowance for loan losses is established at the time of acquistion 
post acquisition date  an allowance for loan losses may need to be established for acquired loans through a provision charged to earnings for credit losses incurred subsequent to acquisition 
under asc  the loss would be measured based on the probable shortfall in relation to the contractual note requirements  consistent with our allowance for loan loss policy for similar loans 
when referring to pnci and pci loans we will use the terms nonaccretable difference  accretable yield  or purchase discount 
nonaccretable difference is the difference between undiscounted contractual cash flows due and undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect  or put another way  it is the undiscounted contractual cash flows we do not expect to collect 
accretable yield is the difference between undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect and the value at which we have recorded the loan on our financial statements 
on the date of acquisition  all purchased loans are recorded on our consolidated financial statements at estimated fair value 
purchase discount is the difference between the estimated fair value of loans on the date of acquisition and the principal amount owed by the borrower  net of charge offs  on the date of acquisition 
we may also refer to discounts to principal balance of loans owed  net of charge offs 
discounts to principal balance of loans owed  net of charge offs is the difference between principal balance of loans owed  net of charge offs  and loans as recorded on our financial statements 
discounts to principal balance of loans owed  net of charge offs arise from purchase discounts  and equal the purchase discount on the acquisition date 
loans are also categorized as covered or noncovered 
covered loans refer to loans covered by a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic loss sharing agreement 
noncovered loans refer to loans not covered by a fdic loss sharing agreement 

table of contents originated loans and pnci loans are reviewed on an individual basis for reclassification to nonaccrual status when any one of the following occurs the loan becomes days past due as to interest or principal  the full and timely collection of additional interest or principal becomes uncertain  the loan is classified as doubtful by internal credit review or bank regulatory agencies  a portion of the principal balance has been charged off  or the company takes possession of the collateral 
loans that are placed on nonaccrual even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled are classified as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonperforming loans 
the reclassification of loans as nonaccrual does not necessarily reflect management s judgment as to whether they are collectible

the company had no pnci loans during the company s policy is to place originated loans and pnci loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status 
in some instances when an originated loan is days past due management does not place it on nonaccrual status because the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
loans where the collateral has been repossessed are classified as foreclosed assets 
management considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans 
alternatives that are considered are foreclosure  collecting on guarantees  restructuring the loan or collection lawsuits

table of contents allowance for loan losses the company s allowance for loan losses is comprised of allowances for originated  pnci and pci loans 
all such allowances are established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
originated and pnci loans  and deposit related overdrafts are charged against the allowance for originated loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely or  with respect to consumer installment loans  according to an established delinquency schedule 
the allowances for originated and pnci loan losses are amounts that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in existing originated loans  based on evaluations of the collectability  impairment and prior loss experience of those loans and leases 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
the company defines an originated or pnci loan as impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired originated and pnci loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance 
in situations related to originated and pnci loans where  for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties  the company grants a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to the borrower that the company would not otherwise consider  the related loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
the company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify to more affordable terms before their loan reaches nonaccrual status 
these modified terms may include rate reductions  principal forgiveness  payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral 
in cases where the company grants the borrower new terms that provide for a reduction of either interest or principal  the company measures any impairment on the restructuring as noted above for impaired loans 
tdr loans are classified as impaired until they are fully paid off or charged off 
loans that are in nonaccrual status at the time they become tdr loans  remain in nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance which the company generally believes to be six consecutive months of payments  or equivalent 
otherwise  tdr loans are subject to the same nonaccrual and charge off policies as noted above with respect to their restructured principal balance 
credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the company s originated and pnci loan portfolios 
these are maintained through periodic charges to earnings 
these charges are included in the consolidated income statements as provision for loan losses 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
however  for a variety of reasons  not all losses are immediately known to the company and  of those that are known  the full extent of the loss may not be quantifiable at that point in time 
the balance of the company s allowances for originated and pnci loan losses are meant to be an estimate of these unknown but probable losses inherent in these portfolios 
the company formally assesses the adequacy of the allowance for originated and pnci loan losses on a quarterly basis 
determination of the adequacy is based on ongoing assessments of the probable risk in the outstanding originated and pnci loan portfolios  and to a lesser extent the company s originated and pnci loan commitments 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of credits based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  growth of the portfolio as a whole or by segment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated or acquired 
they are re graded as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower  when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of nonpayment  or if they become delinquent 
re grading of larger problem loans occurs at least quarterly 
confirmation of the quality of the grading process is obtained by independent credit reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
the company s method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for originated and pnci loan losses includes specific allowances for impaired loans and leases  formula allowance factors for pools of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  interest rates  growth  economic conditions  etc allowance factors for loan pools are based on historical loss experience by product type and prior risk rating 
allowances for impaired loans are based on analysis of individual credits 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the originated or pnci loan portfolio as a whole 
the allowances for originated and pnci loans are included in the allowance for loan losses 
as noted above  the allowances for originated and pnci loan losses consists of a specific allowance  a formula allowance  and an allowance for environmental factors 
the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified credits that meet management s criteria for specific evaluation 
these loans are reviewed individually to determine if such loans are considered impaired 
impaired loans are those where management has concluded that it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
impaired loans are specifically reviewed and evaluated individually by management for loss potential by evaluating sources of repayment  including collateral as applicable  and a specified allowance for loan losses is established where necessary 

table of contents the second component of the allowance for originated and pnci loan losses  the formula allowance  is an estimate of the probable losses that have occurred across the major loan categories in the company s originated and pnci loan portfolios 
this analysis is based on loan grades by pool and the loss history of these pools 
this analysis covers the company s entire originated and pnci loan portfolios including unused commitments but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually and assigned a specific allowance as discussed above 
the total amount allocated for this component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loans and loan commitments 
the loss factors were previously based primarily on the company s historical loss experience tracked over a five year period and adjusted as appropriate for the input of current trends and events 
because historical loss experience varies for the different categories of originated loans  the loss factors applied to each category also differed 
in addition  there is a greater chance that the company would suffer a loss from a loan that was risk rated less than satisfactory than if the loan was last graded satisfactory 
therefore  for any given category  a larger loss estimation factor was applied to less than satisfactory loans than to those that the company last graded as satisfactory 
the resulting formula allowance was the sum of the allocations determined in this manner 
during the three month period ended march   the company converted to a loss migration analysis to determine the formula allowance 
under this method  the company reviewed the loss experience of each quarter over the previous three years and determined an annualized loss rate by loan category as well as risk rating at the beginning of each period reviewed 
a weighted average was then applied to arrive at the average annualized loss rate for each loan category and risk rating  which was then applied against the net recorded investment for all loans by category and risk rating not classified as impaired 
the effect of this change in methodology resulted in a net reduction in formula allowance required of  this loss migration approach was promoted by regulatory agencies and implemented by the company during the three month period ended march  as this was the first period in which sufficient historical data could be compiled to support the analysis 
in addition to updating the method by which the estimated formula allowance required is calculated  management also improved the monitoring and risk recognition within its consumer portfolio 
previously  consumer loans with no identified credit weakness had a risk rating of pass assigned  and this would generally only change if the loan went days past due  at which time the risk rating was systematically downgraded to substandard and the loan was placed in nonaccrual 
for the period ended march   management has chosen to monitor consumer loans based on current credit score and assign a risk rating of special mention for those scores below a certain threshold 
this change is primarily intended to more effectively monitor and manage the risk in the company s portfolio of consumer loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on family residential properties 
the current credit score allows us to better account for increasing default risk in these types of loans 
it is also the only reasonably available tool that can be used to attempt to monitor the performance of the senior lien on the associated properties  as the company does not generally service both the st and nd loans in these instances 
the result of this change in methodology resulted in an additional required formula allowance of   of this additional requirement is specifically related to loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on family residential properties 
the third component of the allowances for originated and pnci loan losses  the environmental factor allowance  is a component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components 
there are several primary reasons that the other components discussed above might not be sufficient to absorb the losses present in the originated and pnci loan portfolios  and the environmental factor allowance is used to provide for the losses that have occurred because of them 
the first reason is that there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the volume of originated and pnci loans makes it impractical to re grade every loan every quarter 
therefore  it is possible that some currently performing originated or pnci loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the second reason is that the loss estimation factors are based primarily on historical loss totals 
as such  the factors may not give sufficient weight to such considerations as the current general economic and business conditions that affect the company s borrowers and specific industry conditions that affect borrowers in that industry 
the factors might also not give sufficient weight to other environmental factors such as changing economic conditions and interest rates  portfolio growth  entrance into new markets or products  and other characteristics as may be determined by management 

table of contents specifically  in assessing how much environmental factor allowance needed to be provided  management considered the following with respect to the economy  management considered the effects of changes in gdp  unemployment  cpi  debt statistics  housing starts  housing sales  auto sales  agricultural prices  and other economic factors which serve as indicators of economic health and trends and which may have an impact on the performance of our borrowers  and with respect to changes in the interest rate environment  management considered the recent changes in interest rates and the resultant economic impact it may have had on borrowers with high leverage and or low profitability  and with respect to changes in energy prices  management considered the effect that increases  decreases or volatility may have on the performance of our borrowers  and with respect to loans to borrowers in new markets and growth in general  management considered the relatively short seasoning of such loans and the lack of experience with such borrowers  and with respect to the potential imprecision in the total allowance for loan losses calculation  management previously included an unspecified reserve equal to of the total allowance and reserve for unfunded commitments calculated 
for the period ended march   this unspecified reserve was eliminated resulting in a reduction in allowances required of  and with respect to loans that have not yet been identified as impaired  management considered the volume and severity of past due loans 
this environmental consideration was added to the company s allowance for loan losses methodology for the period ended march  and resulted in additional allowances required of  each of these considerations was assigned a factor and applied to a portion or the entire originated and pnci loan portfolios 
since these factors are not derived from experience and are applied to large non homogeneous groups of loans  they are available for use across the portfolio as a whole 
acquired loans are valued as of acquisition date in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  business combinations 
loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are referred to as purchased credit impaired pci loans 
pci loans are accounted for under fasb asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
in addition  because of the significant credit discounts associated with the loans acquired in the granite acquisition  the company elected to account for all loans acquired in the granite acquisition under fasb asc topic  and classify them all as pci loans 
under fasb asc topic and fasb asc topic  pci loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition date  factoring in credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
accordingly  an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded as of the acquisition date 
fair value is defined as the present value of the future estimated principal and interest payments of the loan  with the discount rate used in the present value calculation representing the estimated effective yield of the loan 
the difference between contractual future payments and estimated future payments is referred to as the nonaccretable difference 
the difference between estimated future payments and the present value of the estimated future payments is referred to as the accretable yield 
the accretable yield represents the amount that is expected to be recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
if after acquisition  the company determines that the future cash flows of a pci loan are expected to be more than the originally estimated  an increase in the discount rate effective yield would be made such that the newly increased accretable yield would be recognized  on a level yield basis  over the remaining estimated life of the loan 
if after acquisition  the company determines that the future cash flows of a pci loan are expected to be less than the previously estimated  the discount rate would first be reduced until the present value of the reduced cash flow estimate equals the previous present value however  the discount rate may not be lowered below its original level 
if the discount rate has been lowered to its original level and the present value has not been sufficiently lowered  an allowance for loan loss would be established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to decrease the present value to the required level 
if the estimated cash flows improve after an allowance has been established for a loan  the allowance may be partially or fully reversed depending on the improvement in the estimated cash flows 
only after the allowance has been fully reversed may the discount rate be increased 
pci loans are put on nonaccrual status when cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated 
pci loans are charged off when evidence suggests cash flows are not recoverable 
foreclosed assets from pci loans are recorded in foreclosed assets at fair value with the fair value at time of foreclosure representing cash flow from the loan 
asc allows pci loans with similar risk characteristics and acquisition time frame to be pooled and have their cash flows aggregated as if they were one loan

market risk management overview 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the bank is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the bank to undue interest rate risk 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the company s interest rate risk management policies 
the bank has an asset and liability management committee alco which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
asset liability management 
activities involved in asset liability management include but are not limited to lending  accepting and placing deposits  investing in securities and issuing debt 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset liability management 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
the asset liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments 
market value of equity is the net present value of estimated cash flows from the bank s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
the bank uses simulation models to forecast net interest margin and market value of equity 
simulation of net interest margin and market value of equity under various interest rate scenarios is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk 
using computer modeling techniques  the bank is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on net interest margin and market value of equity 
a balance sheet forecast is prepared using inputs of actual loan  securities and interest bearing liability ie deposits borrowings positions as the beginning base 

table of contents in the simulation of net interest income  the forecast balance sheet is processed against various interest rate scenarios 
these various interest rate scenarios include a flat rate scenario  which assumes interest rates are unchanged in the future  and rate ramp scenarios including   and basis points around the flat scenario 
these ramp scenarios assume that interest rates increase or decrease evenly in a ramp fashion over a twelve month period and remain at the new levels beyond twelve months 
the following table summarizes the projected effect on net interest income and net income due to changing interest rates as measured against a flat rate no interest rate change scenario over the succeeding twelve month period 
the simulation results shown below assume no changes in the structure of the company s balance sheet over the twelve months being measured a flat balance sheet scenario  and that deposit rates will track general interest rate changes by approximately interest rate risk simulation of net interest income and net income as of december  change in interest rates basis points estimated change in net interest income nii as of flat nii ramp ramp flat ramp in the simulation of market value of equity  the forecast balance sheet is processed against various interest rate scenarios 
these various interest rate scenarios include a flat rate scenario  which assumes interest rates are unchanged in the future  and rate shock scenarios including   and basis points around the flat scenario 
these rate shock scenarios assume that interest rates increase or decrease immediately in a shock fashion and remain at the new level in the future

neutral sensitivity implies that net interest income does not change when interest rates change 
asset sensitive implies that net interest income increases when interest rates rise  and decrease when interest rates decrease 
the asset liability management policy limits aggregate market risk  as measured in this fashion  to an acceptable level within the context of risk return trade offs 
the simulation results noted above do not incorporate any management actions that might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
in addition  the simulation results noted above contain various assumptions such as a flat balance sheet  and the rate that deposit interest rates change as general interest rates change 
therefore  they do not reflect likely actual results  but serve as estimates of interest rate risk 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding tables 
for example  although certain of the bank s assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing time frames  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the interest rates on certain of the bank s asset and liability categories may precede  or lag behind  changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates of prepayments on loans and investments could vary significantly from the assumptions utilized in deriving the results as presented in the preceding tables 
further  a change in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve could result in different estimations from those presented herein 
accordingly  the results in the preceding tables should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
additionally  the resulting estimates of changes in market value of equity are not intended to represent  and should not be construed to represent  estimates of changes in the underlying value of the bank 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the bank s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
one aspect of these repricing characteristics is the time frame within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
an analysis of the repricing time frames of interest bearing assets and liabilities is sometimes called a gap analysis because it shows the gap between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing in each of a number of periods 
another aspect of these repricing characteristics is the relative magnitude of the repricing for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability given various changes in market interest rates 
gap analysis gives no indication of the relative magnitude of repricing given various changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity gaps are measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the bank s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the following interest rate sensitivity table shows the bank s repricing gaps as of december  in this table transaction deposits  which may be repriced at will by the bank  have been included in the less than month category 
the inclusion of all of the transaction deposits in the less than month repricing category causes the bank to appear liability sensitive 
because the bank may reprice its transaction deposits at will  transaction deposits may or may not reprice immediately with changes in interest rates 
due to the limitations of gap analysis  as described above  the bank does not actively use gap analysis in managing interest rate risk 
instead  the bank relies on the more sophisticated interest rate risk simulation model described above as its primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk

these objectives can be met from either the asset or liability side of the balance sheet 
asset liquidity sources consist of the repayments and maturities of loans  selling of loans  short term money market investments  maturities of securities and sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
these activities are generally summarized as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately  in a net decrease in investment balances and proceeds from the sale of other real estate owned were the major sources of funds in this category 
liquidity may also be generated from liabilities through deposit growth and borrowings 
these activities are included under financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in  financing activities provide funds totaling  due mainly to a  increase in deposit balances 
dividends paid and a decrease in short term other borrowings used  and  of funds  respectively 
the bank also had available correspondent banking lines of credit totaling  at december  in addition  at december   the company had loans and securities available to pledge towards future borrowings from the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank of up to  and  respectively 
as of december   the company had  of other borrowings as described in note of the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes at item of this report 
while these sources are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of funds in the future  their mix  as well as the possible use of other sources  will depend on future economic and market conditions 
liquidity is also provided or used through the results of operating activities

the afs securities plus cash and cash equivalents in excess of reserve requirements totaled  at december   which was of total assets at that time 
this was up from  and at the end of it is anticipated that loan demand may remain weak during  although such demand will be dictated by economic and competitive conditions 
the company aggressively solicits non interest bearing demand deposits and money market checking deposits  which are the least sensitive to interest rates 
the growth of deposit balances is subject to heightened competition  the success of the company s sales efforts  delivery of superior customer service and market conditions 
the reduction in the federal funds rate and various federal reserve interest rate manipulation efforts have resulted in historic low short term and long term interest rates  which could impact deposit volumes in the future 
depending on economic conditions  interest rate levels  and a variety of other conditions  deposit growth may be used to fund loans  to reduce short term borrowings or purchase investment securities 
however  due to concerns such as uncertainty in the general economic environment  competition and political uncertainty  loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain 
the principal cash requirements of the company are dividends on common stock when declared 
the company is dependent upon the payment of cash dividends by the bank to service its commitments 
shareholder dividends are expected to continue subject to the board s discretion and continuing evaluation of capital levels  earnings  asset quality and other factors 
the company expects that the cash dividends paid by the bank to the company will be sufficient to meet this payment schedule 
dividends from the bank are subject to certain regulatory restrictions 
the maturity distribution of certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more is set forth in the following table 
these deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and  therefore  are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available 
the bank participates in a program wherein the state of california places time deposits with the bank at the bank s option

the timing of the maturities indicated in the table below is based on final contractual maturities 
most mortgage backed securities return principal throughout their contractual lives 
as such  the weighted average life of mortgage backed securities based on outstanding principal balance is usually significantly shorter than the final contractual maturity indicated below 
yields on tax exempt securities are shown on a tax equivalent basis
