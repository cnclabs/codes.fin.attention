item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements 
we believe we are the leading manufacturer of aluminum bodied railcars and coal cars in north america  based on the number of railcars delivered 
our railcar manufacturing facilities are located in danville  illinois and roanoke  virginia 
in february  we sub leased approximately of a state of the art production facility located in the shoals region of alabama that was designed to efficiently build a wide variety of railcar types 
this transaction is an important part of our long term growth strategy as we continue to expand our railcar product and service offerings outside of our traditional coal car market 
while our existing facilities will continue to support our coal car products  the shoals facility will allow us to produce a broader variety of railcars in a cost effective and efficient manner 
in addition  the facility layout  automated production equipment  proximity to key suppliers and new supply agreements will increase our flexibility and make us more competitive in the marketplace 
we refurbish and rebuild railcars and sell forged  cast and fabricated parts for all of the railcars we produce  as well as those manufactured by others 
we provide railcar repair and maintenance  inspections and railcar fleet management services for all types of freight railcars through our fcrs subsidiary 
fcrs has repair and maintenance and inspection facilities in clinton  indiana  grand island  nebraska and hastings  nebraska and services freight cars and unit coal trains utilizing key rail corridors in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
we also lease freight cars through our jaix leasing company subsidiary 
our primary customers are financial institutions  shippers and railroads 
railcar deliveries totaled  units  consisting of  new railcars  used railcars   rebuilt railcars and railcars leased  for the year ended december   compared to  units  consisting of  new railcars  used railcars sold and leased railcars delivered  in the same period of our total backlog of firm orders for railcars decreased by  railcars  from  railcars as of december  to  railcars as of december  we have two reportable segments  manufacturing and services 
our manufacturing segment includes new railcar manufacturing  used railcar sales  railcar leasing and major railcar rebuilds 
our services segment includes general railcar repair and maintenance  inspections  parts sales and railcar fleet management services 
corporate includes administrative activities and all other non operating activity 
the north american railcar market is highly cyclical and the trends in the railcar industry are closely related to the overall level of economic activity 
we expect railroads and utilities to continue to upgrade their fleets of aging steel bodied coal cars to modern  higher capacity aluminum  hybrid aluminum and stainless steel  and stainless steel bodied coal cars 
financial statement presentation revenues our manufacturing segment revenues are generated primarily from sales of the railcars that we manufacture 
our manufacturing segment sales depend on industry demand for new railcars  which is driven by overall economic conditions and the demand for railcar transportation of various products  such as coal  steel products  minerals  cement  motor vehicles  forest products and agricultural commodities 
our manufacturing segment sales are also affected by competitive market pressures that impact our market share  the prices for our railcars and by the types of railcars sold 
our manufacturing segment revenues also include revenues from major railcar rebuilds and lease rental payments received with respect to railcars under operating leases 
our services segment revenue sources include parts sales  revenues related to the general maintenance and repair and inspections of railcars and revenue for fleet management services 

table of contents we generally manufacture railcars under firm orders from our customers 
we recognize revenue  when we complete the individual railcars  the railcars are accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk of any damage or other loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer and title to the railcars transfers to the customer 
deliveries include new and used cars sold  cars built and contracted under operating leases and rebuilt cars 
we value used railcars received at their estimated fair market value 
the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion  delivery and customer acceptance of railcars may cause our revenues and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter  which will result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials such as aluminum and steel  as well as the cost of finished railcar components  such as castings  wheels  truck components and couplers  and other specialty components 
our cost of sales also includes labor  utilities  freight  manufacturing depreciation and other operating costs 
factors that have affected our cost of sales include the recent volatility in railcar deliveries  the cost of steel and aluminum  and our efforts to continually reduce manufacturing costs at our manufacturing facilities 
a portion of the contracts covering our backlog at december  are fixed rate contracts 
therefore  if material costs were to increase  we may not be able to pass on these increased costs to our customers 
operating income loss operating income loss represents revenues less cost of sales  gain on sale of railcars available for lease  selling  general and administrative expenses  and plant sale income 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  manufacturing segment revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in manufacturing segment revenues for compared to reflects a higher number of railcars delivered and higher average revenue per railcar 
our manufacturing segment delivered  units  consisting of  new railcars  used railcars   rebuilt railcars and railcars leased  for the year ended december   compared to  units  consisting of  new railcars  used railcars sold and leased railcars for the year ended december  services segment revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the slight decrease in services segment revenues for compared to reflects lower repair volumes and an unfavorable repair and parts sales mix 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
the increase in our consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  reflects an increase in gross profit from our manufacturing segment of million  which was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from our services segment of million 
the increase in gross profit for our manufacturing segment for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due to a higher number of railcars delivered and higher revenue per railcar during  which were partially offset by unfavorable production variances related to production line changeover costs 
the decrease in gross profit for our services segment for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  reflects lower parts sales volume  an unfavorable parts sales mix  an unfavorable repair work mix and increased operating costs in our repair business 
our consolidated gross margin rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or

gain on sale of railcars available for lease for the year ended december  was million and represented the gain on sale of leased railcars with a net book value of million 
operating income loss our consolidated operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  operating income for the manufacturing segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in operating income for our manufacturing segment for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to a higher number of railcars delivered and higher revenue per railcar during  which were partially offset by unfavorable production variances related to production line changeover costs and lower sales of railcars available for lease 
services segment operating income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in operating income for our services segment for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  reflects lower parts sales volume  an unfavorable parts sales mix  an unfavorable repair work mix and increased operating costs in our repair business 
corporate costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in corporate costs was primarily due to increases in compensation and external services 
interest expense income interest expense consisting of commitment fees on our revolving credit facility and letter of credit fees and amortization of deferred financing costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  increases in interest expense for resulted primarily from letter of credit fees 
income taxes the income tax provision was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due the state tax provision based on a blended state tax rate and a provision of million resulting from applying changes in state tax rates on our deferred tax balances partially offset by a million benefit for tax deductible goodwill 
the changes in state tax rates resulted from changes in our estimated state tax apportionment and the expected timing of our utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due to a million benefit for tax deductible goodwill and a benefit of million resulting from applying a change in statutory state tax rates and a change in the estimated state tax apportionment on our deferred tax balances 

table of contents net income loss attributable to freightcar america as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to freightcar america was million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of million from million for the year ended december  for  our basic and diluted net income per share were both  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  and  respectively

our manufacturing segment delivered  units  sold and leased for the year ended december   compared to deliveries of  units  sold and leased for the year ended december  services segment revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in services segment revenues for compared to reflects the inclusion of fcrs revenues for the full year of compared to  which included fcrs revenues for two months  partially offset by lower parts sales 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
the increase in our consolidated gross profit for compared to reflects an increase in gross profit from our manufacturing segment of million and a decrease in corporate costs of million  which were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from our services segment of million 
the increase in gross profit for our manufacturing segment for compared to levels is due to a higher number of railcars delivered  higher average revenue per railcar and improved utilization of our manufacturing capacity during the decrease in gross profit for our services segment for compared to levels reflects lower parts sales and parts sales mix differences 
our consolidated gross margin rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or 
this increase reflects increases in employee bonuses and stock compensation costs of million  salaries of million and product development costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in severance and management contract costs of million and consulting costs of million 
manufacturing segment selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  services segment selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in services segment selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of fcrs selling  general and administrative expenses for the full year of compared to two months of corporate selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  gain on sale of railcars available for lease gain on sale of railcars available for lease for the year ended december  was million and represented the gain on sale of leased railcars with a net book value of million that the company held in excess of twelve months from the date the railcars were initially leased 
there was no gain on sale of railcars available for lease for the year ended december  
table of contents plant closure and sale plant closure and sale income for the year ended december  represents the gain on the sale of our johnstown manufacturing facility 
there was no plant closure and sale income for the year ended december  operating income loss our consolidated operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  operating income for the manufacturing segment was million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  the improvement in operating income for the manufacturing segment reflects increased deliveries  gain on sale of railcars available for lease and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities 
services segment operating income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in services segment operating income was primarily due to lower parts sales volume and an unfavorable parts sales mix for the period compared to corporate costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in corporate costs was primarily due to increases in employee bonuses and stock compensation costs which were partially offset by decreases in severance and management contract costs and consulting costs 
interest expense income interest expense consisting of commitment fees on our revolving credit facility and letter of credit fees and deferred financing costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  amortization and write off of deferred financing costs for the year ended december  included write offs related to our prior credit facilities of million 
reductions in interest expense for the period also resulted from a lower fee structure in our current revolving credit facility compared to our prior revolving credit facilities and increased utilization of cash backed letters of credit rather than letters of credit backed by our revolving credit facility 
income taxes the income tax provision was million for the year ended december   compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due to a million benefit for tax deductible goodwill and a benefit of million resulting from applying a change in statutory state tax rates and a change in the estimated state tax apportionment on our deferred tax balances 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to a blended state tax rate and an increase of for tax deductible goodwill offset by for the impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction and nondeductible expenses 
net income loss attributable to freightcar america as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to freightcar america was million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of million from net loss attributable to freightcar america of million for the year ended december  for  our basic and diluted net income per share were both  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
for  our basic and diluted net loss per share was  on basic and diluted shares outstanding of  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity for the years ended december  and  were our cash provided by operations  cash and cash equivalent balances on hand  our securities held to maturity and our revolving credit facilities 
on july   we entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a loan and security agreement dated as of july  the revolving loan agreement among the company and certain of its subsidiaries  as borrowers collectively  the borrowers  and fifth third bank  as lender 
the proceeds of the revolving credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
the revolving loan agreement also contains a sub facility for letters of credit not to exceed million 
as of december   we had no borrowings or outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility or any expectations to draw upon the revolving credit facility 

table of contents the revolving loan agreement has a term ending on july  and revolving loans outstanding thereunder will bear interest at a rate of libor plus an applicable margin of or at prime  as selected by the borrowers 
we are required to pay a non utilization fee of on the unused portion of the revolving loan commitment 
borrowings under the revolving loan agreement are secured by our accounts receivable  inventory and certain other assets  and borrowing availability is tied to a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the revolving loan agreement has both affirmative and negative covenants  including  without limitation  a minimum tangible net worth covenant and limitations on indebtedness  liens and investments 
the minimum tangible net worth covenant effectively limits potential dividends to million as of december  the revolving loan agreement also provides for customary events of default 
as of december   we had borrowing capacity of million under the revolving loan agreement and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the agreement 
during the first half of  we will be evaluating renewal or refinancing alternatives for our current revolving loan agreement and expect to have a new agreement in place by july  our restricted cash balance was million as of december  and million as of december   and consisted of cash used to collateralize standby letters of credit with respect to performance guarantees and to support our worker s compensation insurance claims 
the standby letters of credit outstanding as of december  are scheduled to expire at various dates through march  we expect to establish restricted cash balances in future periods to minimize bank fees related to standby letters of credit while maximizing our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the value of railcars available for lease was million 
we may continue to offer railcars for lease to certain customers and pursue opportunities to sell leased railcars in our portfolio 
additional railcars available for lease may be funded by cash flows from operations or we may pursue a new credit facility  or both  as we evaluate our liquidity and capital resources 
based on our current level of operations and known changes in planned volume based on our backlog  we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows  our marketable securities and our cash balances  together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our expected liquidity needs 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and any other indebtedness 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund working capital as demand for railcars increases  organic growth opportunities  including new plant and equipment and development of railcars  joint ventures  international expansion and acquisitions  and these capital requirements could be substantial 
management continuously evaluates manufacturing facility requirements based on market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher levels in the future 
our long term liquidity needs also depend to a significant extent on our obligations related to our pension and welfare benefit plans 
we provide pension and retiree welfare benefits to certain salaried and hourly employees upon their retirement 
benefits under our pension plans are now frozen and will not be impacted by increases due to future service 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our net periodic benefit costs are the discount rate used on our pension and postretirement welfare obligations and expected return on pension plan assets 
as of december   our benefit obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement benefit plan was million and million  respectively  which exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million and million  respectively 
we made contributions of million to our defined benefit pension plans during as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we expect to make contributions of  to our defined benefit pension plans in the pension protection act of provides for changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes as well as minimum funding levels 
our defined benefit pension plans are in compliance with the minimum funding levels established in the pension protection act 
funding levels will be affected by future contributions  investment returns on plan assets  growth in plan liabilities and interest rates 
assuming that the plans are fully funded as that term is defined in the pension protection act  we will be required to fund the ongoing growth in plan liabilities on an annual basis 
we made payments to our postretirement benefit plan of million during a substantial portion of our postretirement benefit plan obligation relates to a settlement with the union representing employees at the company s and its predecessors johnstown manufacturing facilities 
the terms of that settlement required us to 
table of contents pay until november  certain monthly amounts toward the cost of retiree health care coverage 
we are currently engaged in negotiations related to the expired settlement agreement but no agreements have been reached 
therefore  the outcome of those negotiations and the impact on our postretirement benefit plan obligation cannot be determined at this time 
if we continued to fund our postretirement benefit plan based on the expired settlement agreement we would make approximately million in payments to the plan in however  the company s postretirement benefit plan obligation could significantly increase or decrease if payments were to cease  if litigation should ensue or if the parties should agree on a modified settlement 
we anticipate funding pension plan contributions and postretirement benefit plan payments with cash from operations and available cash 
based upon our operating performance  capital requirements and obligations under our pension and welfare benefit plans  we may  from time to time  be required to raise additional funds through additional offerings of our common stock and through long term borrowings 
there can be no assurance that long term debt  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations would be expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total year years years after years operating leases material and component purchases total material and component purchases consist of non cancelable agreements with suppliers to purchase materials used in the manufacturing process 
purchase commitments for aluminum are made at a fixed price and are typically entered into after a customer places an order for railcars 
the estimated amounts above may vary based on the actual quantities and price 
the above table excludes million related to a reserve for uncertain tax positions at december  because the timing of the payout of these amounts cannot be determined 
we are a party to letter agreements regarding terms of employment with our president and chief executive officer  vice president  finance  chief financial officer and treasurer and senior vice president  operations and employment agreements with certain other members of our executive management team 
see item executive compensation 
we are also required to make minimum contributions to our pension and postretirement welfare plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding our expected contributions to our pension plans and our expected postretirement welfare benefit payments for cash flows the following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december   and 
table of contents amounts in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities 
our net cash provided by or used in operating activities reflects net income or loss adjusted for non cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our contract receivables  processing of bi weekly payroll and associated taxes  and payments to our suppliers 
as some of our customers accept delivery of new railcars in train set quantities  consisting on average of to railcars  variations in our sales lead to significant fluctuations in our operating profits and cash from operating activities 
we do not usually experience business credit issues  although a payment may be delayed pending completion of closing documentation 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  primarily included net income from operations and changes in working capital 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  included increases in account and contractual payables and customer deposits of million and million  respectively  and other working capital changes 
the increase in account and contractual payables for the year ended december  primarily represents purchases of materials to support increased production levels 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  included our loss from operations and an increase in working capital balances to support the increase in orders and planned production levels  including increases in inventory of million  increases in prepaid expenses of million  decreases in accounts payable of million and decreases in accrued payroll and benefits of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included the purchase of us treasuries of million  restricted cash deposits for collateralization of letters of credit of million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of railcars available for lease of million 
the most significant investing activities for the year ended december  were the sale of railcars available for lease for million which  were partially offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily included cash dividends paid to our stockholders 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures for were primarily cash outlays to enhance our capability to more efficiently produce a more diverse railcar product line in our existing facilities 
the first non coal railcars manufactured using these enhanced capabilities were delivered in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures for were primarily cash outlays to maintain our existing facilities 
excluding unforeseen expenditures  management expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in and will be used to maintain our existing railcar manufacturing and repair and maintenance facilities and provide for capacity expansion in certain facilities  including the recently sub leased shoals railcar manufacturing facility 
management continuously evaluates facility requirements based upon market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher levels in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include long lived assets  goodwill  pension and postretirement benefit assumptions  the valuation reserve on net deferred tax assets  warranty accrual and contingencies and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  under the provisions of asc  property  plant and equipment  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for assets to be held or used  we group a long lived asset or assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
an impairment loss for an asset group reduces only the carrying amounts of a long lived asset or assets of the group being evaluated 
our estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset group include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
our future cash flow estimates exclude interest charges 
we test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
these changes in circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
we routinely evaluate our manufacturing footprint to assess our manufacturing capacity and cost of production in an effort to optimize production at our low cost manufacturing facilities 
we did not perform an impairment analysis of long lived assets during  or because we did not identify any impairment indicators that we believe would have required long lived assets at our facilities to be tested for recoverability during  or impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded on our balance sheet both goodwill and intangible assets  which consist of patents and customer related intangibles 
the company assesses the carrying value of goodwill for impairment as required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other  annually or more frequently whenever events occur and circumstances change indicating potential impairment 
during the quarter ended september   we changed our annual testing date from january to august for its reporting units 
with respect to our annual goodwill testing date  we believe that this voluntary change in accounting method is preferable as it aligns the annual impairment testing date with our long range planning cycle  which is a significant element in the testing process 
in connection with this change  we performed the test as of january  and august  there were no impairment charges as of january  or august  this change in our annual testing date  which was applied prospectively  does not delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
it was impracticable to apply this change retrospectively  as we are unable to objectively determine significant estimates and assumptions that would have been used in those earlier periods without the use of hindsight 
management estimates the valuation of its reporting units using discounted future cash flows  as well as comparing the company s calculated fair value to its market capitalization 
the company determined that there are three reporting units manufacturing  repairs and maintenance and parts 
for each reporting unit with goodwill manufacturing with million and repairs and maintenance with million as  we concluded that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit s net assets exceeded the carrying value as of the dates of our impairment tests for  and additional steps  including an allocation of the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  would be necessary to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment if the fair value of our net assets were less than their carrying value 
the discounted cash flow method involves management making estimates with respect to a variety of factors that will significantly impact the future performance of the business  including 
table of contents future railcar volume projections based on an industry specific outlook for railcar demand  estimated margins on railcar sales  and weighted average cost of capital or wacc used to discount future performance of our company 
because these estimates form a basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
we use industry data to estimate volume projections in our discounted cash flow method 
we believe that this independent industry data is the best indicator of expected future performance assuming that we maintain a consistent market share  which management believes is supportable based on historical performance 
our estimated margins used in the discounted cash flow method are based primarily on historical margins 
management estimated a wacc of for our august  goodwill impairment valuation analyses for both our manufacturing reporting unit and our repair and maintenance reporting unit 
in addition to estimating the fair value of the net assets of our manufacturing reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method in the base case scenario  we also estimated the fair value of the net assets in our manufacturing reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method for two alternate scenarios  including the impact of a negative adjustment to our revenue projections and the impact of a increase in the wacc used in the discounted cash flow method 
we compared the estimated fair value of the net assets in our manufacturing reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method in the base case scenario to the two alternate scenarios 
each of these two alternate scenarios reduced the estimated fair value of the net assets in our manufacturing reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method by between and compared to the estimated fair value of the net assets in our manufacturing reporting unit in the base case  however in all scenarios the estimated fair value of the net assets in our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
although future results may differ from those used in the base case scenario  management believes that the discounted cash flow method using the base case scenario is the best estimate of the lower range of fair value of our reporting units as of august  in addition to estimating the fair value of the net assets of our repair and maintenance reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method in the base case scenario  we also estimated the fair value of the net assets in our repair and maintenance reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method for two alternate scenarios  including the impact of a negative adjustment to our repair revenue projections and the impact of a increase in the wacc used in the discounted cash flow method 
each of these two alternate scenarios reduced the estimated fair value of the net assets in our repair and maintenance reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method by between and compared to the estimated fair value of the net assets in our repair and maintenance reporting unit in the base case 
however  in all scenarios  the estimated fair value of the net assets in our repair and maintenance reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
although future results may differ from those used in the base case scenario  management believes that the discounted cash flow method using the base case scenario is the best estimate of the lower range of fair value of our net assets as of august  pensions and postretirement benefits we provide pension and retiree welfare benefits to certain salaried and hourly employees upon their retirement 
the most significant assumptions used in determining our net periodic benefit costs are the expected return on pension plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our pension and postretirement welfare plan liabilities 
in  we assumed that the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets on a plan by plan basis would range from to 
as permitted under asc the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in our net periodic benefit cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future net periodic benefit cost 
we review the expected return on plan assets annually and would revise it if conditions should warrant 
a change of one percentage point in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have the following effect 
table of contents increase decrease in thousands effect on net periodic benefit cost at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension and postretirement welfare plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which our pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   we determined this rate on our postretirement welfare plan to be  a decrease of from the rate used at december  at december   we determined this rate on our pension plans on a plan by plan basis with results ranging from to 
a change of one percentage point in the discount rate would have the following effect increase decrease in thousands effect on net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december   and  we recognized consolidated pre tax pension cost of  million and million  respectively 
we currently expect to make contributions of million to our pension plans during however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments and changes in interest rates 
the pension protection act of provided for changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes as well as requiring minimum funding levels 
our defined benefit pension plans are in compliance with minimum funding levels established in the pension protection act 
funding levels will be affected by future contributions  investment returns on plan assets  growth in plan liabilities and interest rates 
once the plan is fully funded as that term is defined within the pension protection act  we will be required to fund the ongoing growth in plan liabilities on an annual basis 
we anticipate funding pension contributions with cash from operations 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized a consolidated pre tax postretirement welfare benefit cost of million  million and million  respectively 
a substantial portion of our postretirement benefit plan obligation relates to a settlement with the union representing employees at the company s and its predecessors johnstown manufacturing facilities 
the terms of that settlement required us to pay until november  certain monthly amounts toward the cost of retiree health care coverage 
we are currently engaged in negotiations related to the expired settlement agreement but no agreements have been reached 
therefore  the outcome of those negotiations and the impact on our postretirement benefit plan obligation cannot be determined at this time 
if we continued to fund our postretirement benefit plan based on the expired settlement agreement we would make approximately million in payments to the plan in however  the company s postretirement benefit plan obligation could significantly increase or decrease if payments were to cease  if litigation should ensue or if the parties should agree on a modified settlement 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by asc  income taxes 
we provide for deferred income taxes based on differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for items that are reported for financial statement purposes in periods different from those for income tax reporting purposes 
the deferred tax liability or asset amounts are based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets  liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against the deferred tax assets 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized  we consider both positive and negative evidence including the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the tax law and such taxable income has not previously been used for carryback  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards based on near term and longer term projections of operating results and the length of the carryforward period 
we evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and assess the valuation 
table of contents allowance on a quarterly basis  adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  increased competition  a decline in sales or margins and loss of market share 
at december   we had total net deferred tax assets of million 
the railcar market has an established history of cyclicality based on significant swings in customer demand 
industry projections forecast this trend to continue 
although realization of our net deferred assets is not certain  management has concluded that  based on the positive and negative evidence considered  we will more likely than not realize the full benefit of the deferred tax assets except for our deferred tax assets in certain states in which we operate 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million against the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards in certain states in which we operate 
product warranties we warrant that new railcars produced by us will be free from defects in material and workmanship in normal use identified for a period of up to five years from the time of sale 
with respect to parts and materials manufactured by others and incorporated by us in our products  such parts and materials are covered only by the warranty provided by the original manufacturer 
we establish a warranty reserve at the time of sale to account for future warranty charges 
the warranty reserve consists of two categories assigned claims and unassigned claims 
the unassigned warranty reserve is calculated based on historical warranty costs for the specific railcar types adjusted for estimated material price changes and other factors 
once a warranty claim is filed for railcars under warranty  the estimated cost to correct the defect is moved from the unassigned reserve to the assigned reserve and tracked separately 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues on new and rebuilt railcars when individual cars are completed  the railcars are accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk for any damage or other loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer and title to the railcars transfers to the customer 
we do not record any returns or allowances against sales 
we value used railcars received at their estimated fair market value at the date of receipt less a normal profit margin 
we recognize service related revenue from maintenance and repairs and inspections when all significant maintenance or repair or inspections services have been completed and quality accepted 
we recognize revenue from parts sales when the risk of any damage or loss and title passes to the customer and delivery has occurred 
we recognize operating lease revenue on inventory on lease on a contractual basis and recognize operating lease revenue on railcars available for lease on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
we recognize revenue from the sale of inventory on lease on a gross basis in manufacturing sales and cost of sales if the manufacture of the railcars and the sales process is completed within months 
we recognize revenue from the sale of railcars available for lease on a net basis as gain loss on sale of railcars available for lease since the sale represents the disposal of a long term operating asset 
we recognize a loss when we have a contractual commitment to manufacture railcars at an estimated cost in excess of the contractual selling price 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinite lived intangible asset 
under asu  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset if the entity determines  based on qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not impaired 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   however  early adoption is permitted 
as of december   the company did not elect to early adopt asu  however it is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued changes to asc  intangibles goodwill and other  related to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
these changes provide an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
such qualitative factors may include the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test  otherwise no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  go directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
these changes became effective for our goodwill impairment test performed on january  and august  and did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued changes to accounting standards codification asc  presentation of comprehensive income  to require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the changes eliminated the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income were not changed 
the amended guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
we retrospectively adopted these changes on january  and management elected to use the two statement option 
other than the change in presentation  the adoption of the changes to asc had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued changes to asc  fair value measurement  to conform existing guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure between gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
these changes clarify the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosures and change certain principles or requirements for fair value measurements and disclosures 
the adoption of changes to asc was effective as of january  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements including  in particular  statements about our plans  strategies and prospects 
we have used the words may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan and similar expressions in this prospectus to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including the cyclical nature of our business  adverse economic and market conditions  the highly competitive nature of our industry  our reliance upon a small number of customers that represent a large percentage of our sales  the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion  delivery and customer acceptance of orders  fluctuating costs of raw materials  including steel and aluminum  and delays in the delivery of raw materials  our reliance on the sales of our coal cars  the risk of lack of acceptance of our new railcar offerings by our customers  our reported backlog may not indicate what our future sales will be  potential significant warranty claims  shortages of skilled labor  our ability to manage our health care and pension costs  risks relating to our relationship with our unionized employees and their unions  our ability to maintain relationships with our suppliers of railcar components  the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations  and various covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness that limit our management s discretion in the operation of our businesses 
our actual results could be different from the results described in or anticipated by our forward looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates  forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated 

table of contents given these uncertainties  you should not rely on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made 
we expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward looking statements  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws 
all of the forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under item a  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a million senior secured revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which can be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
on an annual basis  a change in the interest rate in our revolving credit facility will increase or decrease our interest expense by  for every million of outstanding borrowings 
as of december   there were no borrowings or outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
the production of railcars and our operations require substantial amounts of aluminum and steel 
the cost of aluminum  steel and all other materials including scrap metal used in the production of our railcars represents a significant majority of our direct manufacturing costs 
our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in the delivery of aluminum  steel and other materials  all of which are beyond our control 
any fluctuations in the price or availability of aluminum or steel  or any other material used in the production of our railcars  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  if any of our suppliers were unable to continue its business or were to seek bankruptcy relief  the availability or price of the materials we use could be adversely affected 
when market conditions permit us to do so  we negotiate contracts with our customers that allow for variable pricing to protect us against future changes in the cost of raw materials 
when raw material prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers  which could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows 
we are not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange risks as our general policy is to denominate foreign sales and purchases in us dollars
