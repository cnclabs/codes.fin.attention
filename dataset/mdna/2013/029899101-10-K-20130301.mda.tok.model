competition the businesses of gswc are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities  municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories 
however  gswc may be subject to eminent domain proceedings in which government agencies  under state law  may acquire gswc s water systems if doing so is necessary and in the public s interest 
gswc competes with governmental agencies and other investor owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms  availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis 
awr s other subsidiary  asus  actively competes for business with other investor owned utilities  other third party providers of water and or wastewater services and governmental entities primarily on the basis of price and quality of service 
awr workforce awr and its subsidiaries had a total of employees as of february  gswc had employees as of february  nineteen positions in gswc s bear valley electric service bves customer service area are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers  which expires in december sixty eight employees in gswc s region ii are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the utility workers union of america  which expires in gswc has no other unionized employees

we qualify all of our forward looking statement by these cautionary statements 

table of contents item a risk factors you should carefully read the risks described below and other information in this form k in order to understand certain of the risks of our business 
our business is heavily regulated and  as a result  decisions by regulatory agencies and changes in laws and regulations can significantly affect our business our revenues depend substantially on the rates and fees we charge our customers and the ability to recover our costs on a timely basis  including the ability to recover the costs of purchased water  groundwater assessments  electric power  natural gas  chemicals  water treatment  security at water facilities and preventative maintenance and emergency repairs 
any delays by the cpuc in granting rate relief to cover increased operating and capital costs at our public utilities or delays in obtaining approval of our requests for equitable adjustments or price redeterminations for contracted services from the us government may adversely affect our financial performance 
we may file for interim rates in california in situations where there may be delays in granting final rate relief during a general rate case proceeding 
if the cpuc approves lower rates  the cpuc will require us to refund to customers the difference between the interim rates and the rates approved by the cpuc 
similarly  if the cpuc approves rates that are higher than the interim rates  the cpuc may authorize us to recover the difference between the interim rates and the final rates 
interim rates may also be filed with the us government  should there be delays in the price redetermination process 
regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings  affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses  may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses and could result in impairment charges and customer refunds 
management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  liabilities and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and or reserves as deemed necessary 
in the event that our assessment of the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect  we will adjust the associated regulatory asset or liability to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances 
a change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we are also  in some cases  required to estimate future expenses and in others  we are required to incur the expense before recovering costs 
as a result  our revenues and earnings may fluctuate depending on the accuracy of our estimates  the timing of our investments or expenses or other factors 
if expenses increase significantly over a short period of time  we may experience delays in recovery of these expenses  the inability to recover carrying costs for these expenses and increased risks of regulatory disallowances or write offs 
regulatory agencies may also change their rules and policies which may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 
changes in policies of the us government may also adversely affect our military base contract operations 
in certain circumstances  the us government may be unwilling or unable to appropriate funds to pay costs mandated by changes in rules and policies of federal or state regulatory agencies 
the us government may disagree with the increases that we request and may delay approval of requests for equitable adjustment or redetermination of prices which could adversely affect our anticipated rates of return 
we may also be subject to fines or penalties if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws  regulations or orders applicable to our businesses  unless we appeal this determination  or our appeal of an adverse determination is denied 
regulatory agencies may also disallow certain costs if audit findings determine that we have failed to comply with our policies and procedures for procurement or other practices 
our costs involved in maintaining water quality and complying with environmental regulation have increased and are expected to continue to increase our capital and operating costs at gswc can increase substantially as a result of increases in environmental regulation arising from increases in the cost of disposing of residuals from our water treatment plants  upgrading and building new water treatment plants  monitoring compliance activities and securing alternative supplies when necessary 
gswc may be able to recover these costs through the ratemaking process 
we may also be able to recover these costs under settlement and contractual arrangements 
in certain circumstances  costs may be recoverable from parties responsible or potentially responsible for contamination  either voluntarily or through specific court action 

table of contents we may also incur significant costs in connection with seeking to recover costs due to contamination of water supplies 
our ability to recover these types of costs also depends upon a variety of factors  including approval of rate increases  the willingness of potentially responsible parties to settle litigation and otherwise address the contamination and the extent and magnitude of the contamination 
we can give no assurance regarding the adequacy of any such recovery to offset the costs associated with the contamination or the cost of recovery of any legal costs 
we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured we are  from time to time  parties to legal or regulatory proceedings 
these proceedings may pertain to regulatory investigations  employment matters or other disputes 
management periodically reviews its assessment of the probable outcome of these proceedings  the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred  and the availability and extent of insurance coverage 
on the basis of this review  management establishes reserves for such matters 
we may  however  from time to time be required to pay fines  penalties or damages that exceed our insurance coverage and or reserves if our estimate of the probable outcome of such proceedings proves to be inaccurate 
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize our potential liabilities 
however  our insurance policies contain exclusions and other limitations that may not cover our potential liabilities 
generally  our insurance policies cover property  worker s compensation  employer s liability  general liability and automobile liability 
each policy includes deductibles or self insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims 
as a result  we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured 
additional risks associated with our public utility operations our operating costs may increase as a result of groundwater contamination our operations can be impacted by groundwater contamination in certain service territories 
historically  we have taken a number of steps to address contamination  including the removal of wells from service  decreasing the amount of groundwater pumped from wells in order to slow the movement of plumes of contaminated water  constructing water treatment facilities and securing alternative sources of supply from other areas not affected by the contamination 
in emergency situations  we have supplied our customers with bottled water until the emergency situation has been resolved 
in some cases  persons responsible for causing the contamination of groundwater supplies have paid for mitigation actions 
in other cases  we recover our costs in rates 
to date  the cpuc has permitted us to establish memorandum accounts for potential recovery of these types of costs when they arise 
management believes that rate recovery  proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to appropriately manage these types of contamination issues 
however  such issues  if ultimately resolved unfavorably to us  could  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of uncontrollable factors the adequacy of our water supplies varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including rainfall  runoff  flood control and availability of reservoir storage  availability of colorado river water and imported water from northern california  the amount of useable water stored in reservoirs and groundwater basins  the amount of water used by our customers and others  water quality  legal limitations on production  diversion  storage  conveyance and use  and climate change 
population growth and increases in the amount of water used in california have caused increased stress on surface water supplies and groundwater basins 
in addition  court ordered pumping restrictions on water obtained from the sacramento san joaquin delta may decrease the amount of water metropolitan water district of southern california  or mwd  is able to import from northern california 
we have implemented tiered rates and other practices in order to encourage water conservation 
we are also acting to secure additional supplies from desalination and water transfers 
however  we cannot predict to what extent these efforts to reduce stress on our water supplies will be successful or sustainable 

table of contents water shortages at gswc may adversely affect our supply mix  for instance  causing increased reliance upon more expensive water sources  adversely affect our operating costs  for instance  by increasing the cost of producing water from more highly contaminated aquifers  result in an increase in our capital expenditures  for example by requiring the construction of pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply  new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers  and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water  and adversely affect the volume of water sold as a result of mandatory or voluntary conservation efforts by customers 
we may be able to recover increased operating and capital costs through the ratemaking process 
gswc has implemented a modified supply cost balancing account to track and recover costs from supply mix changes and rate changes by wholesale suppliers  as authorized by the cpuc 
we may also recover costs from certain third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
our liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in water supply costs we obtain our water supplies for gswc from a variety of sources 
for example  water is pumped from aquifers within our service areas to meet a portion of the demands of our customers 
when water produced from wells in those areas is insufficient to meet customer demand or when such production is interrupted  we have purchased water from other suppliers 
as a result  our cost of providing  distributing and treating water for our customers use can vary significantly 
furthermore  imported water wholesalers  such as mwd may not always have an adequate supply of water to sell to us 
our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by increases in maintenance costs due to our aging infrastructure some of our systems in california are more than years old 
we have experienced leaks and water quality and mechanical problems in some of these older systems 
in addition  well and pump maintenance expenses are affected by labor and material costs and more stringent water discharge requirements 
although our maintenance costs for decreased as compared to  these costs can increase substantially and unexpectedly 
we include estimated increases in maintenance costs for future years in each general rate case filed by gswc for possible recovery 
we may not recover overages from those estimates in rates 
our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by our conservation efforts conservation by all customer classes at gswc is a top priority 
however  customer conservation can result in lower volumes of water sold 
we may experience a decline in per residential customer water usage due to the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances by residential consumers  and perhaps  efforts by our customers to reduce costs 
our water utility business is heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates charged to our residential customers for the volume of water used 
the rates we charge for water are regulated by the cpuc and may not be adequately adjusted to reflect changes in demand 
declining usage also negatively impacts our long term operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or if growth in the residential customer base does not occur to the extent necessary to offset the per customer residential usage decline 
we implemented a cpuc approved water revenue adjustment mechanism at gswc which has the effect of reducing the adverse impact of our customers conservation efforts on revenues 
however  cash flows from operations can be significantly affected as much of the revenues we recognize in these accounts are collected from customers primarily through surcharges over a twelve to eighteen month period 
our earnings may be affected  to some extent  by weather during different seasons the demand for water and electricity varies by season 
for instance  there can be a higher level of water consumption during the third quarter of each year when weather in california tends to be hot and dry 
during unusually wet 
table of contents weather  our customers generally use less water 
gswc has implemented a cpuc approved water revenue adjustment mechanism  which helps mitigate fluctuations in revenues and earnings due to changes in water consumption by our customers in california 
the demand for electricity in our electric customer service area is greatly affected by winter snows 
an increase in winter snows reduces the use of snowmaking machines at ski resorts in the big bear area and  as a result  reduces our electric revenues 
likewise  unseasonably warm weather during a skiing season may result in temperatures too high for snowmaking conditions  which also reduces our electric revenues 
gswc has implemented a cpuc approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism for our electric business which helps mitigate fluctuations in the revenues and earnings of our electric business due to changes in the amount of electricity used by gswc s electric customers 
our liquidity may be adversely affected by increases in electricity and natural gas prices in california we purchase most of the electric energy sold to customers in our electric customer service area from others under purchased power contracts 
in addition to purchased power contracts  we purchase additional energy from the spot market to meet peak demand 
we may sell surplus power to the spot market during times of reduced energy demand 
as a result  our cash flow may be affected by the increases in spot market prices of electricity purchased and decreases in spot market prices for electricity sold 
however  gswc has implemented supply cost balancing accounts  as approved by the cpuc  to alleviate any fluctuation to earnings 
we also operate a natural gas fueled megawatt generator in our electric service area 
unexpected generator downtime or a failure to perform by any of the counterparties to our electric and natural gas purchase contracts could further increase our exposure to fluctuating natural gas and electric prices 
changes in electricity prices also affect the unrealized gains and losses on our block forward purchased power contracts that qualify as derivative instruments as we adjust the asset or liability on these contracts to reflect the fair market value of the contracts at the end of each month 
the cpuc has authorized us to establish a memorandum account to track the changes in the fair market value of our purchased power contracts 
as a result  unrealized gains and losses on these purchased power contracts do not impact earnings 
we may not be able to procure sufficient renewable energy resources to comply with cpuc rules we are required to procure a portion of our electricity from renewable energy resources to meet the cpuc s renewable procurement requirements 
we have an agreement  subject to cpuc approval  with a third party to purchase renewable energy credits which we believe should allow us to meet these requirements through in the event that the cpuc does not approve this agreement  or the third party fails to perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we may not be able to obtain sufficient resources to meet the renewable procurement requirements by the end of the first compliance period in december  we may be subject to fines and penalties by the cpuc if the cpuc determines that we are not in compliance with the renewable resource procurement rules 
our assets are subject to condemnation municipalities and other government subdivisions may  in certain circumstances  seek to acquire certain of our assets through eminent domain proceedings 
it is generally our practice to contest these proceedings which may be costly and may divert the attention of management from the operation of our business 
if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring our assets  there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the assets acquired or be able to recover all charges associated with the divestiture of these assets 
our costs of obtaining and complying with the terms of franchise agreements are increasing cities and counties in which gswc operates have granted gswc a franchise to construct  maintain and use pipes and appurtenances in public streets and rights of way 
the costs of obtaining  renewing and complying with the terms of these franchise agreements have been increasing as cities and counties attempt to regulate gswc s operations within the boundaries of the city or unincorporated area of the counties in which gswc operates 
cities and counties have also been attempting to impose new fees on gswc s operations  including pipeline abandonment fees and road cut or other types of capital improvement fees 
at the same time  there is increasing opposition from consumer groups to rate increases that may be necessary to compensate gswc for the increased costs of local government regulation 
these trends may adversely affect gswc s ability to recover its costs of providing water service in rates and to efficiently manage capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses within cpuc authorized levels 

table of contents additional risks associated with our contracted services we derive revenues from contract operations primarily from the operation and maintenance of water and or wastewater systems at military bases and the construction of water and wastewater infrastructure on these bases including renewal and replacement of these systems 
as a result  these operations are subject to risks that are different than those of our public utility operations 
our year contracts for servicing military bases create certain risks that are different from our public utility operations we have entered into contracts to provide water and or wastewater services at military bases pursuant to year contracts  subject to termination  in whole or in part  for the convenience of the us government 
in addition  the us government may stop work under the terms of the contracts  delay performance of our obligations under the contracts or modify the contracts at its convenience 
our contract pricing was based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials 
we may be unable to recover all costs if any of these assumptions are inaccurate or if all costs that we may incur in connection with performing the work were not considered 
our contracts are also subject to periodic price adjustments at the time of price redetermination or in connection with requests for equitable adjustment or other changes permitted by the terms of the contracts 
the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
prices are also subject to equitable adjustment based upon changes in circumstances  laws or regulations and service requirement changes with respect to wages and fringe benefits to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
we are required to record all costs under these types of contracts as they are incurred 
as a result  we may record losses associated with unanticipated conditions  higher than anticipated infrastructure levels and emergency work at the time such expenses occur 
we recognize additional revenue for such work as  and to the extent that  our price redeterminations and or requests for equitable adjustments are approved 
delays in obtaining approval of price redeterminations and or equitable adjustments can negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to audits  cost review and investigations by contracting oversight agencies 
certain audit findings such as system deficiencies for government contract reporting requirements may result in delays in price redetermination filings 
during the course of an audit  the oversight agency may disallow costs 
certain payments under these contracts are subject to appropriations by congress 
we may experience delays in receiving payment or delays in redetermination of prices or other price adjustments due to cancelled or delayed appropriations specific to our projects or reductions in government spending for the military generally or military base operations specifically 
appropriations and the timing of payment may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures for the military generally or military base operations specifically 
in august  congress enacted the budget control act which committed the us government to significantly reducing the federal deficit over ten years 
the budget control act called for very substantial automatic spending cuts  known as sequestration 
we do not believe there would be any immediate earnings impact to our existing operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement services provided by asus 
such contracts are not subject to the provisions of the budget control act 
any impact will likely be limited to the timing of funding for these services  a possible delay in the timing of payments  potential delays in the processing of price redeterminations and issuance of contract modifications for new construction work not already funded by the us government  and or delays in the solicitation and or awarding of new utility privatization opportunities 
management also reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually 
asus has million of goodwill which may be at risk for potential impairment if requested price redeterminations and or equitable adjustments are not granted 
risks associated with the collection of wastewater are different  in some respects  from that of our water distribution operations the wastewater collection system operations of our subsidiaries providing wastewater services on military bases are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks 
if collection or sewage systems fail  overflow or do not operate properly  untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers  causing damage to persons or property  injury to aquatic life and economic damages  the cost of addressing which may not be recoverable 
this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding  which are common causes of sewer overflows and system failures 
liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow  our losses might not be covered by insurance policies or we may find it difficult to secure insurance for this business in the future at acceptable rates 

table of contents our contracts for the construction of infrastructure improvements on military bases create risks that are different  in some respects  from that of our operations and maintenance activities we have entered into contract modifications with the us government and in some cases agreements with third parties for the construction of new water and or wastewater infrastructure at the military bases 
most of these contracts are firm fixed price contracts 
under firm fixed price contracts  we will benefit from cost savings  but are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under most circumstances  the us government has approved increased cost change orders due to change in scope of work performed 
we recognize revenues from these types of contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this accounting practice results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs or the physical completion of the construction projects 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on periodic estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability as the construction projects progress 
we establish prices for these types of firm fixed price contracts and the overall year contracts taken as a whole  based  in part  on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our contracted business operations and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by disputes with the us government regarding our performance of contract services on military bases if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows could be adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with the terms of one or more of our us government contracts  other agreements with the us government or us government regulations and statutes  we could be suspended or barred from future us government contracts for a period of time and be subject to possible damages  fines and penalties and damage to our reputation in the water and wastewater industry 
we depend  to some extent  upon subcontractors to assist us in the performance of contracted services on military bases we rely  to some extent  on subcontractors to assist us in the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at military bases 
the failure of any of these subcontractors to perform services for us in accordance with the terms of our contracts with the us government could result in the termination of our contract to provide water and or wastewater services at the affected base s  a loss of revenues or increases in costs to correct a subcontractor s performance failures 
we are able to mitigate these risks  in part  by obtaining and requiring our subcontractors to obtain performance bonds 
we are also required to make a good faith effort to achieve our small business subcontracting plan goals pursuant to us government regulation 
if we fail to use good faith efforts to meet these goals  the us government may assess damages against us at the end of the contract or  for most contracts  at the end of each price redetermination period 
the us government has the right to offset claimed damages against any amounts owed to us 
we also rely on third party manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our construction projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount of costs we incur for these projects exceeds the amount we have estimated in our bid  we could experience reduced profits or losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were needed 
if these subcontractors fail to perform services to be provided to us or fail to provide us with the proper equipment or materials  we may be penalized for their failure to perform  however  our contracts with these subcontractors include 
table of contents certain protective provisions  which may include the assessment of liquidated damages 
we mitigate these risks by requiring many of our subcontractors to obtain performance bonds and to compensate us for any penalties we may be required to pay as a result of their failure to perform 
our earnings may be affected  to some extent  by weather during different seasons seasonal weather conditions  such as hurricanes or significant winter storms  occasionally cause temporary office closures and or result in temporary halts to construction activity at military bases 
to the extent that our construction activities are impeded by these events  we will experience a delay in recognizing revenues from these construction projects 
we continue to incur costs associated with the expansion of our contract activities we continue to incur additional costs in connection with the attempted expansion of our contract operations associated with the preparation of bids for new contracts for contract operations on prospective and existing military bases 
our ability to recover these costs and to earn a profit on our contract operations will depend upon the extent to which we are successful in obtaining new contracts and recovering these costs and other costs from new contract revenues 
other risks our business requires significant capital expenditures the utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums of money for additions to  or replacement of  our property  plant and equipment at our water and electric utilities 
we obtain funds for these capital projects from operations  contributions by developers and others and advances from developers which are repaid over a period of time at no interest 
we also periodically borrow money or issue equity for these purposes 
in addition  we have a syndicated bank credit facility that is partially used for these purposes 
we cannot provide assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return 
our subsidiaries providing water and wastewater services on military bases also expect to incur significant capital expenditures 
to the extent that the us government does not reimburse us for these expenditures as the work is performed or completed  the us government will repay us over time 
however  as previously discussed  if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows will be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by economic conditions access to external financing on reasonable terms depends  in part  on conditions in the debt and equity markets 
when business and market conditions deteriorate  we may no longer have access to the capital markets on reasonable terms 
our ability to obtain funds is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity to third parties or obtaining funds from our revolving credit facility  which expires in may in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets  consolidation of the financial services industry  significant financial service institution failures or our inability to renew or replace our existing revolving credit facility on attractive terms  it may become necessary for us to seek funds from other sources on less attractive terms 
the performance of the capital markets also affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
these assets are subject to market fluctuations  which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected rates of return 
a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if future returns on these assets are insufficient to offset the decline in value 
future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of the reduced value of plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates  and our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 
payment of our debt may be accelerated if we fail to comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements our failure to comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could result in an event of default 
if the default is not cured or waived  we may be required to repay or refinance this debt before it becomes due 
even if we are able to obtain waivers from our creditors  we may only be able to do so on unfavorable terms 

table of contents we awr are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all operations and our only significant assets are investments in our subsidiaries 
this means that we are dependent on distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt 
our subsidiaries only pay dividends if and when declared by the subsidiary board 
moreover  gswc is obligated to give first priority to its own capital requirements and to maintain a capital structure consistent with that determined to be reasonable by the cpuc in its most recent decision on capital structure  in order that customers not be adversely affected by the holding company structure 
furthermore  our right to receive cash or other assets in the unlikely event of liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
if we are unable to obtain funds from a subsidiary in a timely manner  we may be unable to meet our financial obligations  make additional investments or pay dividends 
we must successfully maintain and or upgrade our information technology systems as we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of these systems we rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations 
such systems require periodic modifications  upgrades and or replacement which subject us to inherent costs and risks including potential disruption of our internal control structure  substantial capital expenditures  additional administration and operating expenses  retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems  and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems 
in addition  the difficulties with implementing new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations  if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated 
we rely on our computer  information and communications technology systems in connection with the operation of our business  especially with respect to customer service and billing  accounting and  in some cases  the monitoring and operation of our treatment  storage and pumping facilities 
our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters  telecommunications  failures or acts of war or terrorism or similar events or disruptions 
any of these or other events could cause system interruption  delays and loss of critical data or delay or prevent operations and adversely affect our financial results 
there have been an increasing number of cyber attacks on companies around the world  which have caused operational failures or compromised sensitive corporate or customer data 
these attacks have occurred over the internet  through malware  viruses or attachments to e mails or through persons inside the organization or with access to systems inside the organization 
we have implemented security measures and will continue to devote significant resources to address any security vulnerabilities in an effort to prevent cyber attacks 
despite our efforts  we cannot be assured that a cyber attack will not cause water  wastewater or electric system problems  disrupt service to our customers  compromise important data or systems or result in unintended release of customer information 
moreover  if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of sensitive data  our reputation could be materially damaged 
we would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our operations are geographically concentrated in california although we operate water and wastewater facilities in a number of states  our operations are concentrated in california  particularly southern california 
as a result  our financial results are largely subject to political  water supply  labor  utility cost and regulatory risks  economic conditions and other economic risks affecting california 
california is  among other things  raising taxes in order to help balance the state budget and jobs may be lost to other states which are perceived as having a more business friendly climate 

table of contents we operate in areas subject to natural disasters or that may be the target of terrorist activities we operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes  fires  mudslides  hurricanes  tornadoes and other natural disasters 
while we maintain insurance policies to help reduce our financial exposure  a significant seismic event in southern california  where our operations are concentrated  or other natural disasters could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and electricity or provide wastewater service and adversely affect our costs of operations 
the cpuc has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account to recover these costs for our public utility operations 
terrorists could seek to disrupt service to our customers by targeting our assets 
we have invested in additional security for facilities throughout our regulated service areas to mitigate the risks of terrorist activities 
we also may be prevented from providing water and or wastewater services at the military bases we serve in times of military crisis affecting these bases

the city of claremont claremont located in gswc s region iii  has expressed various concerns to gswc about rates charged by gswc and the effectiveness of the cpuc s rate setting procedures 
in january  the claremont city council members directed staff to pursue analysis required for potential acquisition of the water system and allocated funds from its general reserve for such analysis 
in november  claremont made an offer to acquire gswc s water system servicing claremont 
gswc rejected the offer and clarified that the system is not for sale 
claremont and gswc have however  agreed to hold meetings to further discuss alternatives  rates and other concerns of the city 
gswc serves approximately  customers in claremont

table of contents item legal proceedings water quality related litigation perchlorate and or volatile organic compounds voc have been detected in certain wells servicing gswc s south san gabriel system 
gswc filed suit in federal court  along with two other affected water purveyors and the san gabriel basin water quality authority  together known as the water entities  against some of those allegedly potentially responsible parties prp 
in august  the us environmental protection agency epa issued unilateral administrative orders uao against prps for polluting the groundwater in portions of the san gabriel valley from which gswc wells draw water 
the uao requires these parties to remediate the contamination 
in october  the judge in the lawsuit stayed the matter in order to allow the parties to explore settlement and appointed a special master to oversee mandatory settlement discussions between the prps and the water entities 
the water entities have now successfully reached settlement with all the prps 
legal proceedings are currently in progress to enter the settlements and resolve the claims 
santa maria groundwater basin adjudication in  the santa maria valley water conservation district plaintiff filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants  including gswc  the city of santa maria  and several other public water purveyors 
the plaintiff s lawsuit sought an adjudication of the santa maria groundwater basin the basin 
a stipulated settlement of the lawsuit has been reached  subject to cpuc approval 
the settlement  among other things  if approved by the cpuc  would preserve gswc s historical pumping rights and secure supplemental water rights for use in case of drought or other reductions in the natural yield of the basin 
gswc  under the stipulation  has a right to  acre feet of groundwater replenishment provided by the twitchell project  a storage and flood control reservoir project operated by the plaintiff 
a monitoring and annual reporting program has been established to allow the parties to responsibly manage the basin and to respond to shortage conditions 
if severe water shortage conditions are found over a period of five years  the management area engineer will make findings and recommendations to alleviate such shortages 
if the basin experiences severe shortage conditions  the court has the authority to limit gswc s groundwater production to  acre feet per year  based on developed water in the basin 
over the last five years  gswc s average groundwater production has been  acre feet per year 
in february  the court issued its final judgment  which approved and incorporated the stipulation 
the judgment awarded gswc prescriptive rights to groundwater against the non stipulating parties 
in addition  the judgment granted gswc the right to use the basin for temporary storage and to recapture percent of the return flows that are generated from its importation of state water project water 
pursuant to this judgment  the court retained jurisdiction over all of the parties to make supplemental orders or to amend the judgment as necessary 
in march  the non stipulating parties filed notices of appeal 
in november  the appellate court upheld the santa maria judgment  with a remand to the trial court to clarify the narrow issue that non stipulating parties retained their overlying rights 
there is no dispute on this clarification 
in december  the appellate court further modified the decision clarifying the basis for the overdraft finding that precipitated the prescriptive right finding 
in december  the non stipulating parties filed a request with the california supreme court for a review of the appellate court findings 
in february  the california supreme court denied the parties request for review of the appellate court findings

water and electric gross margins are computed by taking total revenues  less total supply costs 
registrant uses these gross margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results 
registrant believes this measure is a useful internal benchmark in evaluating the performance of gswc 
the discussions and tables included in the following analysis also present registrant s operations in terms of earnings per share by business segment 
registrant believes that the disclosure of earnings per share by business segment provides investors with clarity surrounding the performance of our differing services and information that could be indicative of future performance for each business segment 
registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to our operating budget 
however  these measures  which are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or earnings per share  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of water and electric margins to the most directly comparable gaap measures are included in the table under the section titled operating expenses supply costs 
reconciliations to awr s diluted earnings per share are included in the discussions under the sections titled summary results by segment 
overview registrant s revenues  operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses  through our contracted services business for the operation and maintenance and renewal and replacement of water and or wastewater systems for the us government at various military bases  and through the delivery of electricity in the big bear area of san bernardino county  california 
rates charged to gswc customers are determined by the cpuc 
these rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital 
factors affecting financial performance of gswc are described under forward looking information and include the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers  the ability to recover  and the process for recovering in rates  the costs of distributing water and electricity and our overhead costs  fines  penalties and disallowances by the cpuc arising from failures to comply with regulatory requirements  weather  the impact of increased water quality standards and environmental regulations on the cost of operations and capital expenditures  pressures on water supply caused by population growth  more stringent water quality standards  deterioration in water quality and water supply from a variety of causes  capital expenditures needed to upgrade water systems and increased costs and risks associated with litigation relating to water quality and water supply  including suits initiated by gswc to protect its water supply 
registrant plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years from the cpuc to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
capital expenditures in future years at gswc are expected to remain at much higher levels than depreciation expense 
when necessary  registrant obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings 
asus provides water and or wastewater services  including the operation  maintenance  renewal and replacement of the water and or wastewater systems  at various military installations pursuant to year firm  fixed price contracts 
the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to prospective price redeterminations 
additional revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on new construction activities under contract modifications or work done on behalf of other prime contractors 
as a result  asus is subject to risks that are different than those of gswc 
factors affecting the financial performance of our military utility privatization subsidiaries are described under forward looking information and include delays in receiving payments from and the redetermination and equitable adjustment of prices under the contracts with the us government  fines  penalties or disallowance of costs by the us government  and termination of contracts and suspension or debarment for a period of time from contracting with the government due to violations of federal law and regulations in connection with military utility privatization activities 
our financial performance is also dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate our costs in bidding on firm fixed price construction contracts and the costs of seeking new contracts for the operation and maintenance and renewal and replacement of water and or wastewater services at military bases and for additional construction work at existing bases 
asus is also actively pursuing utility privatization contracts of other military bases to continue the expansion of the contracted services segment

there was also an increase in i other operation expense due primarily to higher labor and other employee related benefits and bad debt expense  and ii property and other taxes 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in maintenance costs and administrative and general expense resulting primarily from lower outside service costs  an overall decrease in interest expense net of interest income and other non operating items of approximately million  or per share  due primarily to i a decrease in short term bank borrowings  ii the redemption on october  of million of notes with a interest rate  iii a reduction in interest expense in connection with the cpuc s final decision issued in july on the water cost of capital proceeding  iv higher interest income earned on regulatory assets and a refund claim approved by the internal revenue service  and v gains recorded on one of gswc s investments  and a decrease in the effective income tax rate for the water segment during the year ended december  as compared to  which increased earnings by approximately per share primarily resulting from changes between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
diluted earnings from electric operations increased by per share during the year ended december  due primarily to i the cpuc s approval of gswc s application to recover million  or per share  in legal and outside services costs previously incurred in connection with bves s efforts to procure renewable energy resources  ii an increase in the electric gross margin of million  or per share  and iii a decrease in the effective income tax rate  which increased earnings by approximately per share primarily resulting from changes between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses excluding the million recovery of legal costs discussed above  which decreased earnings by per share 
diluted earnings from contracted services increased by per share during the year ended december  due primarily to an increase in construction activities at all military bases served  particularly at fort bragg in north carolina  the military bases in virginia  and fort bliss in texas 
at fort bragg  there continues to be significant progress made on a major water and wastewater pipeline replacement project estimated to be substantially completed by the end of 
table of contents a backflow preventer and meter project at fort bragg is also underway and is expected to be completed by mid construction activity at the military bases in virginia has increased primarily due to a pipeline and pump station replacement project  expected to be completed by september finally  there was an overall increase in the renewal and replacement capital work  particularly at fort bliss consistent with the requirements to construct replacement assets under the year contracts with the us government

asus files price redeterminations and requests for equitable adjustments with the us government in order to recover operating expenses and provide profit margin for contracted services 
if adequate rate relief and price redeterminations and adjustments are not granted in a timely manner  operating revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
asus s earnings have also been positively impacted by additional construction projects at each of the military utility privatization subsidiaries 
water for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in water revenues is primarily due to cpuc approved third year rate increases for regions ii and iii effective january  to recover infrastructure improvements and operating costs 
also contributing to the increase in water revenues were advice letter filings made for the revenue recovery on capital projects completed at gswc s region i 
in connection with the last region i rate case approved in december  the cpuc had authorized approximately million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery with advice letters when those projects are completed 
a portion of these projects were completed in late and throughout the remaining projects are expected to be completed during and gswc s revenue requirement and volumetric revenues are adopted as part of a general rate case grc every three years 
gswc filed a grc for all three water regions in july of with rates expected to be effective january  as further discussed in the regulatory matters section  in june  gswc filed a motion to adopt a settlement agreement resolving most issues between gswc  the cpuc s division of ratepayer advocates and the utility reform network in connection with this grc 
the cpuc has not yet issued a proposed decision on this grc 
gswc s billed customer water usage increased by as compared to  but was lower than adopted consumption 
changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on earnings due to the cpuc approved water revenue adjustment mechanism wram account in place in all three water regions 
gswc records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the cpuc in the wram accounts as regulatory assets or liabilities 
electric for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased to million compared to million for due primarily to attrition year increases in electric rates approved by the cpuc effective january  billed electric usage for the year ended december  decreased as compared to due to the cpuc approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism  which adjusts certain revenues to adopted levels authorized by the cpuc  this change in usage did not have a significant impact on earnings 
contracted services revenues from contracted services consist primarily of construction revenues including renewals and replacements and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and or wastewater systems at military bases 
for the year ended december   revenues from contracted services increased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was due  in large part  to an increase in construction activities at all military bases served  particularly at fort bragg in north carolina  the military bases in virginia  fort jackson in south carolina and fort bliss in texas 
at fort bragg  there continues to be significant progress made on a major water and wastewater pipeline replacement project estimated to be substantially completed by the end of a backflow preventer and meter project at fort bragg also contributed to an increase in construction activities and is expected to be completed by mid construction activity at the military bases in virginia has also increased primarily due to a pipeline and pump station replacement project  expected to be complete by september finally  there was also an overall increase in the renewal and replacement work  particularly at fort bliss and fort jackson  consistent with the requirements to construct replacement assets under the year contract with the us government 
the impact of these increases was partially offset by a million increase in revenues recorded during the second quarter of due to a change in estimated costs related to the water and wastewater pipeline project at fort bragg 
the contracted services business continues to receive contract modifications from the us government and agreements with third party prime contractors for new construction projects at the military utility privatization subsidiaries 
earnings and cash flows from amendments and modifications to the original year contracts with the us government may or may not continue in future periods 

table of contents operating expenses supply costs supply costs for the water segment consist of purchased water  power purchased for pumping  groundwater production assessments and water supply cost balancing accounts 
supply costs for the electric segment consist of power purchased for resale including the cost of natural gas used by bves s generating unit  renewable energy credits and the electric supply cost balancing account 
water and electric gross margins are computed by taking total revenues  less total supply costs 
registrant uses these gross margins and related percentages as important measures in evaluating its operating results

water and electric gross margins do not include any depreciation and amortization  maintenance  administrative and general  property or other tax  or other operation expenses 
two of the principal factors affecting water supply costs are the amount of water produced and the source of the water 
generally  the variable cost of producing water from wells is less than the cost of water purchased from wholesale suppliers 
under the modified cost balancing account mcba  gswc tracks adopted and actual expense levels for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes  as established by the cpuc 
gswc records the variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume between adopted and actual water purchased  power purchased  and pump tax 
table of contents expenses as regulatory assets or liabilities 
gswc recovers from or refunds to customers the amount of such variances 
gswc tracks these variances individually for each water ratemaking area 
the overall adopted percentages for purchased water for the years ended december  and were approximately and  respectively  as compared to the actual percentages of and  respectively 
the difference in actual mix compared to the mix approved by the cpuc resulted in an over collection in the mcba account 
the overall water gross margin percent was for the year ended december  as compared to in the same period of purchased water costs for the year ended december  increased by to million as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher water rates charged by wholesale suppliers and an increase in the amount of water purchased in all regions due to an increase in customers water consumption 
for the year ended december   power purchased for pumping decreased to million  compared to million for this was primarily due to lower electric supply rates and improved energy efficiency at gswc s pumping facilities 
for the year ended december   groundwater production assessments were million in  as compared to million in due to an increase in pump tax rates levied against groundwater production effective july due to the mcba account  these additional assessments do not impact the water margin 
the mcba tracks the increases in pump tax rates for future recovery in water rates 
there was a million decrease in the water supply cost balancing account provision during the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to a decrease in the over collection in the mcba account from higher water supply rates and an overall increase in customer demand 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bves division decreased by to million as compared million for due primarily to lower energy prices for power purchased in the spot market during as compared to the difference between the price of purchased power and per megawatt hour authorized by the cpuc is reflected in the electric supply cost balancing account 
other operation expenses the primary components of other operation expenses include payroll  materials and supplies  chemicals and water treatment  and outside service costs of operating the regulated water systems  including the costs associated with water transmission and distribution  pumping  water quality  meter reading  billing  and operations of district offices 
registrant s electric and contracted services operations incur many of the same types of costs as well 
for the years ended december  and  other operation expenses by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total other operation expenses for the year ended december   other operation expenses for water services increased by million as compared to primarily due to an increase in i bad debt expense of  ii labor costs of  due primarily to an increase consistent with the company s annual performance based salary review program and an increase in temporary workers during  iii postage and billing costs of  and iv other miscellaneous operation expenses of  management does not anticipate bad debt expense to continue at these levels 
for the year ended december   other operation expenses for electric services increased by  primarily due to i a  increase in labor and other employee related benefits resulting from an increase in temporary workers  ii a  increase in materials and equipment costs  and iii a  increase in other miscellaneous costs 

table of contents for the year ended december   other operation expenses for contracted services decreased by  as compared to  due largely to a decrease in pre contract costs resulting from a decrease in the number of new capital construction projects for which the military utility privatization subsidiaries are required to perform design and engineering activities 
such costs may fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of design and engineering work that the government may request prior to a contract modification and an assessment of recovery of such cost through contract modifications 
administrative and general expenses administrative and general expenses include payroll expenses related to administrative and general functions  the related employee benefits  insurance expenses  outside legal and consulting fees  regulatory utility commission expenses  expenses associated with being a public company  and general corporate expenses charged to expense accounts

these costs tend to fluctuate year to year and are expected to continue to fluctuate 
decreases in legal and other outside service costs were partially offset by an increase in labor and other employee related benefits of approximately consistent with the company s annual performance based salary review program 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  an impairment charge of  was recorded as a result of the disallowance of certain capital costs in connection with settlement discussions held with the cpuc s division of ratepayer advocates on the rehearing matter from the region ii  region iii and general office rate case  as more fully discussed later under regulatory matters 
for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses for electric services decreased by million compared to primarily due to the cpuc s approval in march of recovery of million of previously incurred legal and outside service costs in connection with bves efforts to procure renewable energy resources 
as a result  in march bves recorded a million reduction in legal and outside service costs  which had been previously expensed as incurred through march  the decrease in administrative and general expenses due to this item was partially offset by higher regulatory expenses incurred in connection with the current general rate case 
in  bves is expecting to make another filing with the cpuc to recover additional costs incurred from april  through december  totaling approximately  which have been expensed 
if approved by the cpuc  bves will record a regulatory asset and corresponding decrease to legal and outside services costs 
for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses for contracted services decreased by million due primarily to an increase in the allocation of overhead expenses to construction costs as compared to the same period in  as a result of increased construction activities primarily at fort bragg in north carolina  fort jackson in south carolina and fort bliss in texas 
the allocation of overhead expenses to construction costs is reflected under asus construction expenses 
as the military bases experienced higher construction activities relative to non construction activities  allocated overhead cost to construction expense proportionately increased 
the decrease in overhead allocation to administrative and general expenses was partially offset by an increase in labor and other employee related benefits  and outside service costs

for the year ended december   revenues from contracted services increased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   construction revenues increased primarily due to an increase in construction activities at fort bliss and fort bragg 
additionally  as a result of a change in estimated costs by onus on a water and wastewater pipeline replacement project at fort bragg  an increase in operating income of approximately million was recorded during the second quarter of the change in estimated costs was a result of successful negotiations to reduce the cost of construction work by contractors 
in november  the government also issued a contract modification to odus for a sewer rehabilitation project at fort lee that had been completed in the prior year 
the contract modification provided for  of additional construction revenues for the year ended december  management fee revenues decreased for the year ended december  this is primarily due to million in management fees received in in connection with requests for equitable adjustment reas and contract modifications resolved with the us government that were retroactive
