business overview we are a national provider of home infusion and other home healthcare services that partners with patients  physicians  hospitals  healthcare payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide clinical management solutions and the delivery of cost effective access to prescription medications and home healthcare services 
our services are designed to improve clinical outcomes to patients with chronic and acute healthcare conditions while controlling overall healthcare costs 
as of december   we had a total of locations in states encompassing home nursing locations and home infusion locations  including two contract affiliated infusion pharmacies 
our platform provides nationwide service capabilities and the ability to deliver clinical management services that offer patients a high touch  community based and home based care environment 
our core services are provided in coordination with  and under the direction of  a patient physician 
our pharmacy and home health professionals  including pharmacists  nurses  respiratory therapists and physical therapists  work with the physician to develop a plan of care suited to our patient specific needs 
whether in the home  physician office  ambulatory infusion center or other alternate sites of care  we provide products  services and condition specific clinical management programs tailored to improve the care of individuals with complex health conditions such as cancer  multiple sclerosis  organ transplants  bleeding disorders  rheumatoid arthritis  immune deficiencies and congestive heart failure 
our business is currently reported under three segments infusion services  home health services and pharmacy benefit management pbm services 
these three segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker reviews our results in terms of allocating resources and assessing operating and financial performance 
the infusion services segment provides services consisting of home infusion therapy  respiratory therapy and the provision of durable medical equipment products and services 
infusion services include the dispensing and administering of infusion based drugs  which typically require additional nursing and clinical management services  equipment to administer the correct dosage and patient training designed to improve patient outcomes 
home infusion services also include the dispensing of self injectible therapies 
the home health services segment provides services which include the provision of skilled nursing services and therapy visits  private duty nursing services  hospice services  rehabilitation services and medical social services to patients primarily in their home 
since the acquisition of critical homecare solutions holdings  inc chs in march   we have implemented certain managed care contracts across both the infusion services and home health services segments 
the contracted rates have reduced reimbursement levels compared to the out of network reimbursement levels received prior to june   when we began the process of moving certain out of network payors under national contracts 
on a year over year basis  the contracts have reduced net revenue per patient in certain therapies and drug classes and  correspondingly  our gross profit margin and segment adjusted 
table of contents ebitda  as defined below 
however  the contract relationship allows greater access to more insured lives 
we have seen sequential and year over year volume trends increase from these contracted relationships 
the pbm services segment consists of integrated pbm services  which primarily consists of discount card programs 
the discount card programs provide a cost effective alternative for individuals who may be uninsured  underinsured or may have restrictive coverage that disallows reimbursement for certain medications 
under these discount programs  individuals who present a discount card at one of the company participating network pharmacies receive prescription medications at a discounted price compared to the retail price 
in addition  in the company capacity as a pharmacy benefit manager  it has fully funded prescription benefit programs where the company reimburses its network pharmacies and third party payors in turn reimburse the company based on medi span reported pricing for those claims fulfilled for their plan participants 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced a strategic assessment of our business and operations 
this assessment focused on expanding revenue opportunities and lowering corporate overhead  including workforce and benefit reductions and facility rationalization 
it also examined our market strengths and opportunities and compared our position to that of our competitors 
as a result of the assessment  we focused our growth on investments in the infusion services and home health services segments and elected to pursue offers for a large portion of our pharmacy services segment 
thus  on february   the company entered into a community pharmacy and mail business purchase agreement the asset purchase agreement by and among walgreen co 
and certain subsidiaries collectively  the buyers and the company and certain subsidiaries collectively  the sellers with respect to the sale of certain assets  rights and properties the pharmacy services asset sale relating to the sellers traditional and specialty pharmacy mail and community retail pharmacy store operations 
pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we received a total purchase price of approximately million during  including approximately million at closing which included monies received for the inventories on hand attributable to the operations subject to the pharmacy services asset sale  and a subsequent additional purchase price payment of million based on events related to the buyer retention of certain business after closing 
similarly  the company may be required to refund up to approximately million of the cash received to the buyers 
any gain associated with this contingency will be recorded once the final amount retained or refunded is known 
the million purchase price excluded all accounts receivable and working capital liabilities relating to the operations subject to the sale  which were retained by us 
approximately million of these net assets were converted to cash subsequent to the sale 
we are continuing to execute our strategic plan and are investing in opportunities to maximize stockholder value going forward 
we deployed the proceeds of the pharmacy services asset sale seeking business acquisition opportunities described below 
we also paid off the line of credit balance following the sale and negotiated improved terms for its ongoing use 
on july   we acquired infuscience  inc infuscience for a cash payment of million 
the purchase price could increase to million based on the results of operations during the month period following the closing 
infuscience acquires  develops and operates businesses providing alternate site infusion pharmacy services 
the acquisition has added five infusion centers located in eagan  minnesota  omaha  nebraska  chantilly  virginia  charleston  south carolina  and savannah  georgia 
subsequent to december   we acquired of all of the issued and outstanding equity of homechoice partners  inc  a delaware corporation homechoice pursuant to that stock purchase agreement dated december  the purchase agreement by and among the company  homechoice  davita healthcare partners inc  a delaware corporation and majority stockholder of homechoice  and the other stockholders of homechoice 
the purchase price was million  subject to adjustment based in part on the net working capital of homechoice at closing the purchase price 
the purchase price may also be increased in an amount up to million if homechoice reaches certain performance milestones in the two years following the closing 
the company funded the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and its revolving credit facility 
homechoice is a provider of alternate site infusion pharmacy services 
headquartered in norfolk  va  homechoice services approximately  patients annually and has fourteen infusion pharmacy locations in pennsylvania  washington  dc  maryland  virginia  north carolina  south carolina  georgia  missouri  and alabama 
the transaction became effective on february  other strategic options that we may consider in addition to further potential acquisitions include redeeming all or a portion of the unsecured notes and reinvesting certain proceeds in the infusion services and home health services operating segments  subject to the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our the senior unsecured notes 
the pharmacy services asset sale discussed above caused us to perform a further strategic assessment of our business and operations in order to align our corporate structure with our remaining business operations 
as a result of the reassessment and subsequent realignment  we have focused on expanding revenue opportunities and lowering corporate overhead as well as 
table of contents redeploying our resources strategically 
these actions have resulted in write downs of certain long lived assets  employee severance  retention bonus payments and accelerated recognition of expense associated with certain of our contractual obligations 
the impact of these efforts included a reduction in salaries  benefits  rent and other facility costs 
the redeployment of resources following the asset sale has better positioned us for growth in our strategic areas of operation  however  the impact of these actions on our future consolidated financial statements cannot be estimated 
regulatory matters update approximately of revenue for the year ended december  was derived directly from medicare  state medicaid programs or other government payors 
we also provide services to beneficiaries of medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored healthcare programs through managed care entities 
medicare part d  for example  is administered through managed care entities 
in the normal course of business  the company and our customers are subject to legislative and regulatory changes impacting the level of reimbursement received from the medicare and state medicaid programs 
state medicaid programs in and  increased medicaid spending  combined with slow state revenue growth  led many states to institute measures aimed at controlling spending growth 
spending cuts have taken many forms including reducing eligibility and benefits  eliminating certain types of services  and provider reimbursement reductions 
in addition  some states are moving beneficiaries to managed care programs in an effort to reduce costs 
no single state medicaid program represents greater than of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  and no individual state medicaid reimbursement reduction to us as a provider is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we are continually assessing the impact of the state medicaid reimbursement cuts as states propose  finalize and implement various cost saving measures 
we incurred a reimbursement cut in from tenncare  the state of tennessee medicaid program  for certain home health services  and incurred a second tenncare rate cut in the home health services segment effective january  in may  the second rate cut was adjusted to  which was retroactively effective beginning on january  these reimbursement rate cuts decreased revenue by approximately million 
given the reimbursement pressures  we continue to improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs to mitigate the impact on results of operations where possible 
in some cases  reimbursement rate reductions may result in negative operating results  and we would likely exit some or all services where rate reductions result in unacceptable returns to our shareholders 
medicare federal efforts to reduce medicare spending are expected to continue in congress first passed the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  and the health care and education reconciliation act of  which amended ppaca 
in august  congress passed a deficit reduction agreement that created a super committee that was tasked with proposing legislation by november  because the super committee did not act  automatic medicare cuts were scheduled to go into effect january  however  congress passed legislation extending the time for such cuts by two months 
unless congress takes additional action  medicare reimbursement to providers will be reduced overall by beginning april  the reductions in medicare reimbursement could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  although the impact cannot yet be predicted 
there may also be other impacts from the automatic spending reductions that we cannot predict 
for example  staff at cms and medicare administrative contractors may be reduced  which could result in delays in claims processing 
thus far  we have been impacted by cms rule revisions which reduced reimbursement rates applicable to the home health division of our business 
in october  cms issued a final rule to update and revise medicare home health rates for calendar year the final rule reduced our home health segment revenue and gross profit by million on an annual basis compared to in november  cms issued a final rule for home health agency reimbursement for that would result in a decrease in reimbursement 
we estimate that this rule will have a limited impact on revenue 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be 
table of contents reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting estimates and judgments made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the accounting estimates or judgments made in the preparation of our financial statements and in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report  which contain a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition we generate revenue principally through the sale of prescription drugs and nursing services 
prescription drugs are dispensed through a pharmacy owned by us 
fee for service agreements include i pharmacy agreements  where we dispense prescription medications through our pharmacy facilities and ii pbm agreements  where prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies participating in our retail pharmacy network 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc  addresses situations in which there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement with a customer and provides guidance in determining whether multiple deliverables should be recognized separately or in combination 
we provide a variety of therapies to patients 
for infusion related therapies  we frequently provide multiple deliverables of drugs and related nursing services 
after applying the criteria from asc  we concluded that separate units of accounting exist in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if the drug is shipped  the drug revenue is recognized at the time of shipment  and nursing revenue is recognized on the date of service 
the company allocates revenue consideration based on the relative fair value as determined by the company best estimate of selling price to separate the revenue where there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement 
revenue generated under pbm agreements is classified as either gross or net based on whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through our retail pharmacy network 
when we independently have a contractual obligation to pay a network pharmacy provider for benefits provided to its plan sponsors members  and therefore are the primary obligor as defined in asc topic  revenue recognition asc  we include payments which include the drug ingredient cost from these plan sponsors as revenue and payments to the network pharmacy providers as cost of revenue 
these transactions require us to pay network pharmacy providers  assume credit risk of plan sponsors and act as a principal 
if we merely act as an agent  and consequently administer plan sponsors network pharmacy contracts  we do not have the primary obligation to pay the network pharmacy and assume credit risk and as such record only the administrative fees and not the drug ingredient cost as revenue 
revenue generated under discount card agreements is recognized when the discount card is used to purchase a prescription drug 
the revenue is based on contractual rates per transaction 
broker fees associated with the marketing of the discount cards are incurred and recognized at the time the card is used and classified as selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in our infusion home health services segment  we also recognize infusion nursing revenue as the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and plan sponsors for services rendered and products provided 
this revenue is recognized as the treatment plan is administered to the patient and is recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement or payment arrangements with payors 
under the medicare prospective payment system program  home health net revenue is recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors 
revenue is recognized ratably over a day episode period and is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
medicare cash receipts under the prospective payment system are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently recognized as revenue over the day episode period 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on estimates of losses related to receivable balances 
the risk of collection varies based upon the product  the payor commercial health insurance and government and the patient s ability to pay the amounts 
table of contents not reimbursed by the payor 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon several factors including the age of the outstanding receivables  the historical experience of collections  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for the ability to pay 
collection agencies are employed and legal action is taken when we determine that taking collection actions is reasonable relative to the probability of receiving payment on amounts owed 
management judgment is used to assess the collectability of accounts and the economic ability of our customers to pay 
judgment is also used to assess trends in collections and the effects of systems and business process changes on our expected collection rates 
the company reviews the estimation process quarterly and makes changes to the estimates as necessary 
when it is determined that a customer account is uncollectible  that balance is written off against the existing allowance 
the following table sets forth the aging of our december  and december  net accounts receivable net of allowance for contractual adjustments and prior to allowance for doubtful accounts  aged based on date of service and categorized based on the three primary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands as of december  days over days total government commercial patient allowance for doubtful accounts total as of december  days over days total government commercial patient allowance for doubtful accounts total government includes million and commercial includes million of accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts related to the termination of the centers for medicare medicaid competitive acquisition program cap contract as of december  in prior years  commercial included one pharmacy network agreement under which various plan sponsors were served and which plan sponsors account for  in the aggregate  receivables that accounted for of the company total accounts receivable balance as of december  this contract was transferred to walgreen co 
as part of the pharmacy services asset sale 
at december  there was no remaining balance associated with this pharmacy services contract 
commercial balances declined million during the year ended december  due to the collection of outstanding pharmacy related balances retained following the sale of the related operations 
the commercial balance greater than days old increased by million primarily because of the remaining pharmacy related balances that have not yet been collected 
at december  the remaining pharmacy services gross accounts receivable balance was million and the related allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
allowance for contractual discounts we are reimbursed by plan sponsors for products and services we provide 
payments for medications and services covered by plan sponsors are generally less than billed charges 
we monitor revenue and receivables from plan sponsors on an account specific basis and record an estimated contractual allowance for certain revenue and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date to properly account for anticipated differences between amounts billed and amounts reimbursed 
accordingly  the total revenue and receivables reported in our financial statements are recorded at the amounts expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions for a portion of our revenue are largely computerized  which enables on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount the primary insurance plan expects to pay at the time of sale to record net revenue  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited 
for the remaining portion of our revenue  the contractual allowance is estimated based on several criteria  including unbilled and or initially rejected claims  historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes 
table of contents in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled 
we do not believe these changes in estimates are material 
amounts due to plan sponsors payables to plan sponsors primarily represent payments received from plan sponsors in excess of the contractually required reimbursement 
these amounts are refunded to plan sponsors 
these payables also include the sharing of manufacturers rebates with plan sponsors 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes under asc topic  income taxes asc 
asc requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined by calculating the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefit from our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is reversed when sufficient evidence exists that we will be able to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company has a full valuation allowance of million recorded against its deferred tax assets 
we will maintain this valuation allowance until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained or we are able to develop tax planning strategies that enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are realizable 
as of december   the company has deferred tax liabilities of million relating to indefinite lived goodwill and intangibles 
these deferred tax liabilities cannot be used as a future source of taxable income because of the indefinite nature of the assets and therefore cannot be used to offset the deferred tax assets that require a valuation allowance 
the deferred tax liability for these indefinite lived goodwill and intangibles will continue to increase as the company continues to amortize the tax deductible amounts of these assets 
the tax amortization related to these assets will increase the deferred tax liability as well as create tax expense in future years until the full valuation allowance is reversed or the asset is fully amortized for tax purposes 
we file income tax returns  including returns for our subsidiaries  as prescribed by federal tax laws and the tax laws of the state and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination and are recognized in the financial statements when the recognition threshold and measurement attributes of asc are met 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the goodwill valuation is based on a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the first step indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step must be performed which determines the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
the measurement of possible impairment is based upon the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit to its carrying value 
we use a third party valuation specialist to assist in the annual impairment valuation 
as of december   our reporting units include goodwill of million in the infusion reporting unit  goodwill of million and indefinite lived assets of million in the home health services reporting unit  and goodwill of million in the pbm services reporting unit 
the goodwill of the infusion and home health reporting units was primarily recorded as a result of the acquisition of chs in march in performing an annual evaluation of goodwill  a reporting unit fair value is determined based on discounted future cash flows and a market based comparison to industry peers 
significant estimates used in a fair value determination include future forecasted earnings and the working capital requirements of the business to generate estimated cash flows 
our estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results potentially resulting in impairment of the goodwill 
none of the reporting units are more susceptible to general economic conditions than others  however our home health reporting unit is more susceptible to government reimbursement changes 
if future cash flows do not achieve estimated levels due to further rate cuts in medicaid or medicare or other changes impacting operating performance  goodwill of the home health services reporting unit could be impaired 
also  the cash flow model used to determine fair value is sensitive to the discount rate used 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and determined that the 
table of contents discount rate used could increase by a factor of and the goodwill of our infusion and pbm services reporting segments would not be impaired 
however  the goodwill of the home health services reporting unit would be impaired if there is a need to use a higher discount rate in the analysis 
carrying values are determined based on the specific assets and liabilities of each reporting unit and allocations of corporate assets  liabilities and expenses 
as of december   indefinite lived intangible assets included million in certificates of need and million of trademarks acquired in the chs transaction 
these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using techniques similar to the goodwill valuation described above  based largely upon discounted cash flows 
if future cash flows do not achieve estimated levels  intangible assets could become impaired in future periods 
like goodwill  the cash flow model used to determine fair value is sensitive to the discount rate used 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and determined that the discount rate used could increase by a factor of and the indefinite lived intangible assets would not be impaired 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  property  plant and equipment asc 
the measurement of possible impairment of property  plant and equipment is based on the ability to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
impairment losses  if any  would be determined based on the present value of the cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business 
accounting for stock based compensation compensation cost for all share based payments are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model that uses the following assumptions i expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock  ii the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and iii the expected life of options granted is derived from previous history of stock exercises from the grant date and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination assumptions under the valuation model 
the fair value of the award is amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we expense restricted stock awards based on vesting requirements  including time elapsed  market conditions  and or performance conditions 
because of these requirements  the weighted average period for which the expense is recognized varies 
we expense stock appreciation right sar awards based on vesting requirements 
in addition  because they are settled with cash  the fair value of the sar awards are revalued on a quarterly basis 
off balance sheet arrangements investment in equity of unconsolidated affiliate in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities  the company analyzes its variable interests to determine if an entity in which it has a variable interest is a variable interest entity 
the company analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews 
the company bases its quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity  and its qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity  its organizational structure  including decision making ability  and relevant financial agreements 
the company also uses its qualitative analysis to determine if it must consolidate a variable interest entity as its primary beneficiary 
the company has an affiliate equity investment in a variable interest entity that has developed a platform that facilitates the flow  management and sharing of vital health and medical information with stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem 
the company concluded that the entity is a variable interest entity because the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional support from other parties 
the company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the entity is held by another stakeholder  and therefore does not consolidate the entity 
the company recorded its initial net investment in the variable interest entity of million and subsequent working capital contributions in the investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliate line on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets using the equity method of accounting 
the maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the variable interest entity is million  which represents the current book value and additional commitments made to fund future potential working capital needs 

table of contents reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation due primarily to the new segment structure 
such reclassifications had no material effect on our previously reported consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
it compares our annual results of operations with the prior year results of operations 
year ended december  vs 
december  year ended december  in thousands change revenue gross profit income from operations interest expense  net loss income before income taxes net loss from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  infusion services segment revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to revenue of million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
product revenue increased million  or 
infusion service revenue increased million  or 
home health services segment revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to revenue of million for the same period in  a decrease of million  or 
this reduction is primarily due to the decline in medicare reimbursement rates 
pbm services segment revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to revenue of million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
this increase is due primarily to an increase in discount card programs sales 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  the net increase in gross profit was due to organic growth and gross profit contributed by infuscience partially offset by a decrease in average gross profit percentage 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is due to a higher mix of lower margin chronic product sales which resulted from our infusion relationship with certain payers and the shift of administration of these products to the home or alternate site from hospital outpatient clinics and physician offices 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the same period in the increase in sg a was primarily due additional employee and facility related costs necessary to support the significant growth in infusion revenues  combined with the addition of infuscience operations 
bad debt expense 
for the year ended december   bad debt expense was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  for the same period in acquisition and integration expenses 
during the year ended december  we incurred acquisition and integration expenses of million associated with the acquisitions of infuscience and homechoice partners 
we did not incur acquisition and integration related expenses during the year ended december  restructuring and other expenses 
we incurred restructuring and other expenses of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and december  during the year ended december  these expenses included approximately million of transitional expenses eg  training  redundant salaries and wages  and retention 
table of contents bonuses for certain critical personnel  million of employee severance and other benefit related costs  million of third party consulting costs  and million of other costs 
restructuring and other expenses during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million of third party consulting costs  million of employee severance and other benefit related costs related to workforce reductions  million of facility related costs and million of transitional expenses 
restructuring and other expenses include expenses resulting from the execution of our strategic assessment and related restructuring plans  consisting primarily of employee severance and other benefit related costs  third party consulting costs  facility related costs  and certain other costs 
during the year ended december  they also include million for certain state sales tax liabilities related to an acquired company for which prior period tax amounts were identified and recorded in the company anticipates that additional restructuring will occur and thus we may incur significant additional charges such as the write down of certain long lived assets  employee severance  other restructuring type charges  temporary redundant expenses  potential cash bonus payments and potential accelerated payments or termination costs for certain of its contractual obligations  which impact the company future consolidated financial statements 
amortization of intangibles 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of intangible assets of million compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in amortization is in large part related to the intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of infuscience 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in interest expense for the year ended december  included million of interest expense related to our million of senior unsecured notes and million related to the senior secured revolving credit facility

we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at this time 
management does not believe that our exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time because the variable interest rate negotiated in the revolving credit facility is subject to a rate floor which is above current market rates 
market rates can 
table of contents increase and not cause an increase in our variable interest rate 
our revolving credit facility agreement provides for the use of interest rate swaps as a strategy to manage interest rate market risk 
we regularly assess the significance of interest rate market risk as part of our treasury operations and as circumstances change and will enter into interest rate swaps as appropriate 
at december   the carrying values of accounts receivable  accounts payable  claims payable  payables to plan sponsors and others approximate fair value due to their short term nature
