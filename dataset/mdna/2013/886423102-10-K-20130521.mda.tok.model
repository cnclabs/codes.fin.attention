our global vessel fleet the company continues a vessel construction  acquisition and replacement program  with an intent of being able to operate in nearly all major oil and gas producing regions of the world 
in recent years our focus has been on replacing older vessels in the company s fleet with larger  more technologically sophisticated vessels 
since calendar  the company has purchased and or constructed vessels at a total cost of approximately billion and at march   has an additional vessels under construction or committed to be purchased for a total cost of approximately million 
to date  the company has generally funded its vessel programs from its operating cash flows  funds provided by three private debt placements of senior unsecured notes totaling million  a million term bank loan  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  and various sales leaseback arrangements 
the company s strategy contemplates organic growth through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide and possible acquisitions of recently built vessels and or other vessel owners and operators 
the company has the largest number of new offshore supply vessels among its competitors in the industry 
the company intends to pursue its long term fleet replenishment and modernization strategy on a disciplined basis and  in each case  will carefully consider whether proposed investments and transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
the average age of the company s owned or chartered vessels excluding joint venture vessels and vessels withdrawn from service at march  is approximately years 
the average age of newer vessels in the fleet defined as those that have been acquired or constructed since calendar year as part of the company s new build and acquisition program as discussed below is approximately years 
the remaining vessels have an average age of years 
of the company s vessels  are deepwater vessels  are in the non deepwater towing supply supply vessels 
sixty nine are other vessel classes are primarily comprised of crewboats and offshore tugs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements at march   the company had agreements to acquire two vessels and commitments to build vessels at a number of different shipyards around the world at a total cost  including contract costs and other incidental costs  of approximately million 
of the new construction commitment vessels  six are towing supply vessels with  brake horsepower bhp  are deepwater platform supply vessels psvs ranging between  and  deadweight tons of cargo capacity  one is a fast supply boat  two are specialty construction support vessels two are crewboats 
scheduled delivery for these newbuild vessels began in april  with delivery of the final vessel expected in the quarter ended september the company currently is experiencing substantial delay with one fast supply boat under construction in brazil that was originally scheduled to be delivered in september of a discussion of this matter is disclosed in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
at march   the company had invested million in progress payments towards the construction of vessels and the remaining expenditures necessary to complete construction was estimated at million 
the aggregate purchase commitments for the two deepwater psvs with  deadweight tons of cargo capacity is million 
the company took possession of one of the psvs in april for a total cost of million and expects to take possession of the remaining psv in july for a total cost of million 
no investments had been made as of march  with respect to these two deepwater psvs 
a discussion of the company s capital commitments  scheduled delivery dates and vessel sales is disclosed in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item also contains a table comparing the actual march  vessel count and the average number of vessels by class and geographic distribution during the three years ended march   and between april and march  the company also disposed of vessels 
most of the vessel sales were sold at prices that exceeded their carrying values 
in aggregate  proceeds from  and pre tax gains on  vessel dispositions during this period approximated million and million  respectively 
our vessel classifications our vessels regularly and routinely move from one operating area to another  often to and from offshore operating areas of different continents 
we disclose our vessel statistical information  such as revenue  utilization and average day rates  by vessel class 
listed below are our three major vessel classes along with a description of the type of vessels categorized in each class and the services the respective vessels typically perform 
tables comparing the average size of the company s marine fleet by class and geographic distribution for the last three fiscal years are included in item of this report 
deepwater vessels this class of equipment is currently the company s biggest contributor to consolidated vessel revenue and vessel operating margin 
included in this vessel class are large typically greater than feet and or with at least  tons in dead weight cargo carrying capacity psvs and large  higher horsepower generally greater than  horsepower anchor handling towing supply ahts vessels 
these vessels are generally chartered to customers for use in transporting supplies and equipment from shore bases to deepwater and intermediate water depth offshore drilling rigs  platforms 
deepwater psvs generally have large cargo capacities  both below deck liquid mud tanks and dry bulk tanks and above deck  and support drilling and production operations and offshore construction and maintenance work 
the deepwater ahts vessels are equipped to tow drilling rigs and other marine equipment  as well as to set anchors for the positioning and mooring of drilling rigs 
many of our deepwater ahts and psvs are outfitted with dynamic positioning capabilities  which allow the vessel to maintain an absolute or relative position when mooring to an installation  rig or another vessel is impractical or undesirable 
our customers demand a high level of safety and technological advancements to meet the more stringent regulatory standards especially in the wake of the deepwater horizon incident 

table of contents 
index to financial statements this class of vessel also includes specialty vessels that can support offshore well stimulation  construction work  subsea services and or have fire fighting capabilities and or accommodation facilities 
these vessels are generally available for routine supply and towing services but are outfitted and primarily intended for specialty services 
for example  these vessels can be equipped with a variety of lifting and deployment systems  including large capacity cranes  winches or reel systems 
included in the specialty vessel category is the company s one multi purpose platform supply vessel mpsv  which is designed for subsea service and construction support activities and which is significantly larger in size  more versatile  and more specialized than the psvs discussed above 
the mpsv typically commands a higher day rate because the vessel has more capabilities  and because the vessel has a higher construction cost and higher operating costs 
towing supply and supply vessels this is currently the company s largest fleet class by number of vessels 
included in this class are non deepwater towing supply vessels with horsepower below  bhp  and non deepwater psvs that are generally less than feet 
the vessels in this class perform the same functions and services as their deepwater vessel class counterparts except they are generally chartered to customers for use in intermediate and shallow waters 
other vessels the company s other vessels included crewboats  utility vessels and offshore tugs 
crewboats and utility vessels are chartered to customers for use in transporting personnel and supplies from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs  platforms and other installations 
these vessels are also often equipped for oil field security missions in markets where piracy  kidnapping or other potential violence presents a concern 
offshore tugs tow floating drilling rigs  assist in the docking of tankers  tow barges  assist pipe laying  cable laying and construction barges  and are used in a variety of other commercial towing operations  including towing barges carrying a variety of bulk cargoes and containerized cargo 
revenue contribution of main classes of vessels revenues from vessel operations were derived from the following classes of vessels in the following percentages year ended march  deepwater vessels towing supply supply other shipyard operations quality shipyards  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  operated two shipyards in houma  louisiana  that construct  upgrade and repair vessels 
the shipyards perform repair work and new construction work for third party customers  as well as the construction  repair and modification of the company s own vessels 
during the last three fiscal years  quality shipyards  llc has constructed and delivered a foot psv which was delivered in november one of the two shipyards was sold during fiscal and the remaining yard is currently being used for repair work 
during fiscal  one partially constructed  foot psv was transferred to another unaffiliated us shipyard 
delivery of this unit is scheduled for april customers and contracting the company s operations are materially dependent upon the levels of activity in offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production throughout the world  which is affected by trends in global crude oil and natural gas pricing  including expectations of future commodity pricing  which are ultimately influenced by the supply and demand relationship for these natural resources 
the activity levels of our customers are also influenced by the cost of exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas  which can be affected by environmental regulations  technological advances that affect energy production and consumption  significant weather conditions  the ability of our customers to raise capital  and local and international economic and political environments  including government mandated moratoriums 
a discussion 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of current market conditions and trends appears under macroeconomic environment and outlook in item of this report 
the company s principal customers are major and independent oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies  foreign government owned or government controlled organizations and companies that explore and produce oil and natural gas  drilling contractors  and companies that provide other services to the offshore energy industry  including but not limited to  offshore construction companies  diving companies and well stimulation companies 
in recent years  the consolidation of exploration  field development  and production companies has reduced the number of customers for the company s vessels and services 
this development may negatively affect exploration  field development and production activity as consolidated companies generally focus initially on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise 
such activity could adversely affect demand for our vessels  and reduce the company s revenues 
this trend is likely to continue in the future  although for every merger in the industry  there is frequently a start up company that takes the place of the merged company  in numerical terms  if not in levels of activity 
our primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts on our vessels on a rate per day of service basis  therefore  vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
as noted above  these time charter contracts are generally either on a term or spot basis 
there are no material differences in the cost structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term because the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract 
the following table discloses our customers that accounted for or more of total revenues during our last three fiscal years chevron corporation including its worldwide subsidiaries and affiliates petroleo brasileiro sa while it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our time charter contracts turn over  the unexpected loss of either or both of these two significant customers could  at least in the short term  have a material adverse effect on the company s vessel utilization and its results of operations 
the five largest customers of the company in aggregate accounted for approximately of our fiscal total revenues  while the largest customers in aggregate accounted for approximately of the company s fiscal total revenues 
competition the principal competitive factors for the offshore vessel service industry are the suitability and availability of vessel equipment  price and quality of service 
in addition  the ability to demonstrate a strong safety record and attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel are also important competitive factors 
the company has numerous competitors in all areas in which it operates around the world  and the business environment in all of these markets is highly competitive 
the company s diverse  mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of its assets generally enable the company to respond relatively quickly to changes in market conditions and to provide a broad range of vessel services to its customers around the world 
we believe the company has a competitive advantage because of the size  diversity and geographic distribution of our vessel fleet 
economies of scale and experience level in the many areas of the world in which we operate are also considered competitive advantages as is the company s strong financial position 
an increase in worldwide vessel capacity could have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly when there are lower levels of exploration  field development and production activity 
according to ihs petrodata  the global offshore supply vessel market at the end of march had approximately new build offshore support vessels psvs and anchor handlers and towing supply vessels only under construction that are expected to be delivered into the worldwide offshore vessel market primarily over the next three years 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels  of which tidewater estimates more than are stacked 
the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry  however  also 
table of contents 
index to financial statements has a large number of aged vessels  including approximately vessels  or  of the worldwide offshore fleet  that are at least years old and nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives 
these older vessels  of which tidewater estimates more than one third are already stacked  could potentially be removed from the market within the next few years as the cost of extending these vessels lives may not be economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the company believes that the retirement of a sizeable portion of these aged vessels could mitigate the potential negative effects of new build vessels on vessel utilization and vessel pricing 
additional vessel demand could also be created by the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units that are expected to be delivered and become operational over the next few years  which could mitigate the possible negative effects of the new build vessels being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
challenges we confront as an international offshore vessel company we operate in many challenging operating environments around the world that present varying degrees of political  social  economic and other uncertainties 
we operate in markets where risks of expropriation  confiscation or nationalization of our vessels or other assets  terrorism  piracy  civil unrest  changing foreign currency exchange rates and controls  and changing political conditions may adversely affect our operations 
although the company takes what it believes to be prudent measures to safeguard its property  personnel and financial condition against these risks  it cannot eliminate entirely the foregoing risks  though the wide geographic dispersal of the company s vessels helps reduce the potential impact of these risks 
in addition  immigration  customs  tax and other regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof can have a material impact on our ability to work in certain countries and on our operating costs 
in some international operating environments  local customs or laws may require the company to form joint ventures with local owners or use local agents 
the company is dedicated to carrying out its international operations in compliance with the rules and regulations of the office of foreign assets control ofac  the trading with the enemy act  the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  and other applicable laws and regulations 
the company has adopted policies and procedures to mitigate the risks of violating these rules and regulations 
sonatide joint venture tidewater has a interest in sonatide  a joint venture with sonangol that owns vessels that serve the angolan offshore energy industry 
tidewater has been in discussions over the last few years with sonangol to establish the terms and conditions of a new sonatide joint venture agreement 
the company s existing joint venture agreement with sonangol has been extended on several occasions during those discussions to allow ongoing negotiations to continue 
the last extension was effective through march  while the existing joint venture agreement has therefore formally expired  sonatide continues its normal day to day operations without significant effects resulting from that expiration 
the company has previously experienced gaps when the term of the existing joint venture agreement had expired and before an extension agreement had been signed 
while the company is continuing discussions with sonangol to restructure the existing joint venture and overall commercial relationship  important and fundamental issues remain outstanding and unresolved 
the parties did have several constructive meetings during the quarter ended march  if negotiations relating to the sonatide joint venture are ultimately unsuccessful  however  the company will work toward an orderly wind up of the joint venture 
based on prior conduct between the parties during this period of uncertainty  we believe that the joint venture would be allowed to honor existing vessel charter agreements through their contract terms 
even though the global market for offshore supply vessels is currently reasonably well balanced  with offshore vessel supply approximately equal to offshore vessel demand  there would likely be negative financial impacts associated with the wind up of the existing joint venture and the possible redeployment of vessels to other markets  including mobilization costs and costs to redeploy tidewater shore based employees to other areas  in addition to lost revenues associated with potential downtime between vessel contracts 
these financial impacts could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to our results of operations and cash flows for the periods when such costs would be incurred 
if there is a need to redeploy vessels which are currently deployed in angola to other international markets  tidewater believes that there is sufficient demand for these vessels at prevailing market day rates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements sonangol continues to express a willingness to consider some further contracting activity by the sonatide joint venture 
during the quarter ended march   the sonatide joint venture entered into several new contracts with customers  some of which extend into during the twelve months ended march   the company redeployed vessels from its angolan operations to other markets and also transferred vessels into its angolan operations from other markets 
the net reduction in the number of vessels operating in its angolan operations during this twelve month period was not significant 
the vessels that were redeployed outside its angolan operations during the twelve months ended march   were chartered at new day rates that were comparable to  or higher than the rates included in their respective expiring contracts in angola  in part because of generally improving markets for these vessels 
for the year ended march   tidewater s angolan operations generated vessel revenues of approximately million  or  of its consolidated vessel revenue  from an average of approximately tidewater owned vessels that are marketed through the sonatide joint venture of which were stacked on average during the year ended march   and  for the year ended march   generated vessel revenues of approximately million  or  of consolidated vessel revenue  from an average of approximately tidewater owned vessels of which were stacked on average during the year ended march   and  for the year ended march   generated vessel revenues of approximately million  or  of consolidated vessel revenue  from an average of approximately vessels of which were stacked on average in fiscal 
in addition to the company s angolan operations  which reflect the results of tidewater owned vessels marketed through the sonatide joint venture owned by tidewater  ten vessels and other assets are owned by the sonatide joint venture 
as of march  and march   the carrying value of tidewater s investment in the sonatide joint venture  which is included in investments in  at equity  and advances to unconsolidated companies  is approximately million and million  respectively 
international labour organization s maritime labour convention the international labour organization s maritime labour convention  the convention seeks to mandate globally  among other things  seafarer working conditions  ship accommodations  wages  conditions of employment  health and other benefits for all ships and the seafarers on those ships that are engaged in commercial activities 
this convention has now exceeded the requisite countries needed for ratification

notably  although fiji  lebanon and gabon have submitted instruments of ratification  their respective registrations for member state social protection benefits are still pending 
the aforementioned countries represent more than of the world s vessel tonnage  and  as such the requisites for ratification were met in august of for this convention to become law in august in those ratifying countries 
because the company maintains that this convention is unnecessary in light of existing international labor laws that offer substantial equivalency to the labor provisions of the convention  the company continues to work with flag state and industry representatives to object to further ratifications of this convention 
the company continues to assess its global seafarer labor relationships and to review its fleet operational practices in light of the convention requirements 
where the convention will apply  the company and its customers operations may be negatively affected by future compliance costs which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

under the isps code  the company performs worldwide security assessments  risk analyses  and develops vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations 
additionally  the company has developed security annexes for those us flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the united states coast guard pursuant to the latest revision of marsec directive environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunction and other sanctions 
compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change however  and may impose increasingly strict requirements and  as such  the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations

safety we are committed to ensuring the safety of our operations for both our employees and our customers 
the company s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents safety challenges 
because the work environment presents these challenges  the company works diligently to maintain workplace safety 
management regularly communicates with its personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits through company media and safety review sessions 
we also regularly conduct safety training meetings for our seamen and shore based staff personnel 
we dedicate personnel and resources to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance 
our director of health  safety and environmental management is involved in proactive efforts to prevent accidents and injuries and reviews all incidents that occur throughout the company 
in addition  the company employs safety personnel at every operating location who are responsible for administering the company s safety programs and fostering the company s safety culture 
we believe that every employee is a safety supervisor  and give each employee the right  the responsibility  and the obligation to stop any operation that the employee deems to be unsafe  whether it is deemed to be  in retrospect  unsafe or not 
risk management the operation of any marine vessel involves an inherent risk of marine losses including physical damage to the vessel attributable to adverse sea and weather conditions  mechanical failure  and collisions 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes the company to the potential risks of damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities  hostile activities attributable to war  sabotage  pirates and terrorism  as well as business interruption due to political action or inaction  including nationalization of assets by foreign governments 
any such event may lead to a reduction in revenues or increased costs 
the company s vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss  including war  acts of terrorism  and pollution risks  but the company does not fully insure for business interruption 
the company also carries workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  director and officer liability  general liability including third party pollution and other insurance customary in the industry 
the company seeks to secure appropriate insurance coverage at competitive rates by maintaining a self retention layer up to certain limits on its marine package policy 
the company carefully monitors claims and participates actively in claims estimates and adjustments 
estimated costs of self insured claims  which include estimates for incurred but unreported claims  are accrued as liabilities on our balance sheet 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad  and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
the resulting economic  political and social uncertainties  including the potential for future terrorist acts and war  could cause the premiums charged for our insurance coverage to increase 
the company currently maintains war risk coverage on its entire fleet 
management believes that the company s insurance coverage is adequate 
the company has not experienced a loss in excess of insurance policy limits  however  there is no assurance that the company s liability coverage will be adequate to cover potential claims that may arise 
while the company believes that it should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable  it cannot guarantee such with the current level of uncertainty in the markets the company operates 
seasonality the company s global vessel fleet generally has its highest utilization rates in the warmer months when the weather is more favorable for offshore exploration  field development and construction work 
hurricanes  cyclones  monsoon season  and severe weather can impact operations

the vessels that operate in australia are impacted by cyclone season from november to april 
customers in this region  where possible  plan business activities around the cyclone season  however  australia generally has high trade winds during the non cyclone season and  as such  the impact of the cyclone season on our operations is not significant 
although hurricanes  cyclones  monsoons and other severe weather can impact operations  the company s business volume is more dependent on crude oil and natural gas pricing  global supply of crude oil and natural gas  and demand conditions for the company s offshore marine services than any seasonal variation

oil and gas prices are highly volatile commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile 
prices are extremely sensitive to the respective supply demand relationship for crude oil and natural gas 
high demand for crude oil and natural gas  reductions in supplies and or low inventory levels for these resources as well as any perceptions about future supply interruptions can cause prices for crude oil and natural gas to rise 
conversely  low demand for crude oil and natural gas  increases in supplies and or increases in crude oil and natural gas inventories cause prices for crude oil and natural gas to decrease 
in addition  global military  political  and economic events  including civil unrest in the middle east and north africa oil producing and exporting countries  have contributed to crude oil and natural gas price volatility 
factors that affect the supply of crude oil and natural gas include  but are not limited to  the following global demand for hydrocarbons  the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec ability to control crude oil production levels and pricing  as well as  the level of production by non opec countries  sanctions imposed by the us  the european union  or other governments against oil producing countries  political and economic uncertainties including wars  terrorist acts or security operations  advances in exploration and field development technologies  significant weather conditions  and governmental policies restrictions placed on exploration and production of natural resources 
prolonged material downturns in crude oil and natural gas prices and or perceptions of long term lower commodity prices can negatively impact the development plans of exploration and production companies given the long term nature of large scale development projects  which would likely result in a corresponding decline in

index to financial statements demand for offshore support vessel services and a reduction in charter rates and or utilization rates  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
higher commodity prices  however  do not necessarily translate into increased demand for offshore support vessel services as increased commodity supply could come from land based energy sources 
crude oil pricing volatility has increased in recent years as crude oil has emerged into a financial asset class used for speculative purchase 
traditionally  crude oil futures and options were purchased by commercial traders for future production in an effort to hedge against price risk 
more recently  non commercial market participants have traded crude oil derivatives to profit off of fluctuations in the price performance of crude oil 
the extent to which speculation causes excessive crude oil pricing volatility is currently not fully known  however  a material adverse effect on our results of operations could potentially occur depending on the extent which speculative price volatility  especially as it relates to declines  in crude prices affects the decisions of offshore exploration and production companies 
changes in the level of capital spending by our customers demand for our vessels  and thus our results of operations are highly dependent on the level of capital spending for exploration and field development by the companies that operate in the energy industry 
the energy industry s level of capital spending is substantially related to current and expected future demand for hydrocarbons and the prevailing commodity prices of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas 
when commodity prices are low  or when our customers believe that they will be low in the future  our customers generally reduce their capital spending budgets for onshore and offshore drilling  exploration and field development 
the level of offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity has historically been volatile  and that volatility is likely to continue 
other factors that influence the level of capital spending by our customers that are beyond our control include worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas  the cost of offshore exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas  which can be affected by environmental regulations  significant weather conditions  technological advances that affect energy production and consumption  local and international economic and political environment  the availability and cost of financing 
consolidation of the company s customer base oil and natural gas companies  energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone consolidation  and additional consolidation is possible 
consolidation reduces the number of customers for the company s equipment  and may negatively affect exploration  field development and production activity as consolidated companies focus on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise 
such activity could adversely affect demand for the company s vessels and reduce the company s revenues 
the offshore marine service industry is highly competitive we operate in a highly competitive industry  which could depress vessel charter rates and utilization and adversely affect our financial performance 
we compete for business with our competitors on the basis of price  reputation for quality service  quality  suitability and technical capabilities of vessels  availability of vessels  safety and efficiency  cost of mobilizing vessels from one market to a different market  and national flag preference 
in addition  competition in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring  among other things  local construction  flagging  ownership or control of vessels  the awarding of contracts to local contractors  the employment of local citizens and or the purchase of supplies from local vendors that favor or require local ownership 
in general  declines in the level of offshore drilling and development activity by the energy industry negatively affects the demand for our vessels and results in downward pressure on day rates 
extended periods of low vessel demand and or low day rates reduce the company s revenues 
risk associated with the loss of a major customer we derive a significant amount of revenue from a relatively small number of customers 
for the years ended march   and  the five largest customers accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total revenues  while the largest customers accounted for a respective   and of our total revenues 
while it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our time 
table of contents 
index to financial statements charter contracts turn over  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if one or more of these customers decide to interrupt or curtail their activities  terminate their contracts with us  fail to renew existing contracts  and or refuse to award new contracts  and we were unable to contract our vessels with new customers at comparable day rates 
unconventional natural gas sources are exerting downward pricing pressures on the price of natural gas the rise in production of unconventional gas resources onshore shale plays resulting from technological advancements in horizontal drilling and fracturing in north america and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas lng export facilities around the world are contributing to an over supplied natural gas market 
while production of natural gas from unconventional sources is still a relatively small portion of the worldwide natural gas production  it is increasing because improved drilling efficiencies are lowering the costs of extraction 
there is a significant oversupply of natural gas inventories in the united states in part due to the increase of unconventional gas in the market 
prolonged increases in the worldwide supply of natural gas  whether from conventional or unconventional sources  will likely continue to weigh on natural gas prices 
a prolonged period of low natural gas prices would likely have a negative impact on development plans of exploration and production companies at least in regards to development plans primarily targeting natural gas  which in turn  may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services 
this effect could be particularly acute in our americas segments  specifically our shallow water us gom operations  which is more oriented towards natural gas than crude oil production  and therefore more sensitive to the changes in the market pricing for natural gas than to changes in the market pricing of crude oil 
challenging macroeconomic conditions uncertainty about future global economic market conditions makes it challenging to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
the success of our business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial and credit markets that are outside of our control and difficult to predict 
uncertain economic conditions may lead our customers to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values 
similarly  when lenders and institutional investors reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to corporate and other industrial borrowers  the liquidity and financial condition of our customers can be adversely impacted 
these factors may also adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
factors such as interest rates  availability of credit  inflation rates  economic uncertainty  changes in laws including laws relating to taxation  trade barriers  commodity prices  currency exchange rates and controls  and national and international political circumstances including wars  terrorist acts or security operations can have a material negative effect on our business and operations  which in turn would reduce our revenues and profitability 
prolonged material economic downturns in crude oil and natural gas prices can negatively affect the development plans of exploration and production companies 
in addition  a prolonged recession may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services and a reduction in charter rates and or utilization rates  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
potential overcapacity in the offshore marine industry over the past decade  as offshore exploration and production activities increasingly focused on deepwater well exploration  field development and production  offshore service companies  such as ours  constructed specialized offshore vessels that are capable of supporting complex deepwater and deep well defined by well depth rather than water depth projects that are generally located in challenging environments 
during this time  construction of offshore vessels increased significantly in order to meet customer demands 
excess offshore supply vessel capacity usually exerts downward pressure on charter day rates 
excess capacity can occur when newly constructed vessels enter the market and also when vessels migrate between market areas 
while the company is committed to the construction of additional vessels  it has also sold and or scrapped a significant number of vessels over the last several years 
a discussion about the aging of the company s fleet  which has necessitated the company s new vessel construction programs  appears in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item in this report 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the offshore supply vessel market has approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels  anchor handlers and towing supply vessels only  under construction as of march   that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market primarily over the next three years  according to ods petrodata 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels  according to the same source 
an increase in vessel capacity could result in increased competition in the company s industry which may have the effect of lowering charter rates and utilization rates  which  in turn  would result in lower revenues to the company 
in addition  the provisions of the shipping act restricting engagement of us coastwise trade to vessels controlled by us citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign competitors that seek to engage in trade reserved for vessels controlled by us citizens and otherwise qualifying for coastwise trade 
a repeal  suspension or significant modification of the shipping act  or the administrative erosion of its benefits  permitting vessels that are either foreign flagged  foreign built  foreign owned  foreign controlled or foreign operated to engage in the us coastwise trade  could also result in excess vessel capacity and increased competition especially for our vessels that operate in north america 
risks associated with vessel construction and maintenance the company has a number of vessels currently under construction  and it may construct additional vessels in response to current and future market conditions 
in addition  the company routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance services 
construction projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns  resulting from shortages of equipment  materials and skilled labor  lack of shipyard availability  unforeseen design and engineering problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  unscheduled delays in the delivery of material and equipment  financial and other difficulties at shipyards including labor disputes and shipyard insolvency  and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals 
a significant delay in either construction or drydockings of vessels could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill contract commitments and to realize timely revenues with respect to vessels under construction  conversion or other drydockings 
significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the demand for vessels currently under construction may diminish from levels originally anticipated 
if the company fails to obtain favorable contracts for newly constructed vessels  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
also  difficult economic market conditions and or prolonged distress in credit and capital markets may hamper the ability of shipyards to meet their scheduled deliveries of new vessels or the ability of the company to renew its fleet through new vessel construction or acquisitions 
in addition  there is always the risk of insolvency of the shipyards that construct or drydock our vessels  which could adversely affect our new construction or repair programs  and consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
risks associated with operating internationally we operate in various regions throughout the world  which exposes us to many risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the united states  some of which have recently become more pronounced 
our customary risks of operating internationally include political and economic instability within the host country  possible vessel seizures or nationalization of assets and other governmental actions by the host country please refer to item in this report and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of our venezuelan operations regarding vessel seizures including enforcement of customs or other laws that are not well developed or consistently enforced  foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors  an inability to recruit and retain management of overseas operations  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changing taxation policies  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  revaluations  devaluations and restrictions on repatriation of currency  and import export quotas and restrictions or other trade barriers most of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company is also subject to acts of piracy and kidnappings that put its assets and personnel at risk 
the increase in the level of these criminal or terrorist acts over the last few years has been well publicized 
as a marine services company that operates in offshore  coastal or tidal waters  the company is particularly 
table of contents 
index to financial statements vulnerable to these kinds of unlawful activities 
although the company takes what it considers to be prudent measures to protect its personnel and assets in markets that present these risks  it has confronted these kinds of incidents in the past  and there can be no assurance it will not be subjected to them in the future 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition as a result of terrorism  political instability or war 
risks associated with doing business through joint ventures the company operates in several foreign areas through a joint venture with a local company  in some cases as a result of local laws requiring local company ownership 
while the joint venture partner may provide local knowledge and experience  entering into joint ventures inevitably requires us to surrender a measure of control over the assets and operations devoted to the joint venture  and occasions may arise when we do not agree with the business goals and objectives of our partner  or other factors may arise that make the continuation of the relationship unwise or untenable 
any such disagreements or discontinuation of the relationship could disrupt our operations and affect the continuity of our business 
if we are unable to resolve issues with a joint venture partner  we may decide to terminate the joint venture and either locate a different partner and continue to work in the area or seek opportunities for our vessels in another area 
the unwinding of an existing relationship could prove to be difficult or time consuming  and the loss of revenue related to the termination or unwinding of a joint venture and costs related to the sourcing of a new partner or the mobilization of vessels to another area could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
international operations exposed to currency devaluation and fluctuation risk since we are a global company  our international operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
for some of our international contracts  a portion of the revenue and local expenses are incurred in local currencies and the company is at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we generally do not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business  which exposes us to the risk of exchange rate losses 
gains and losses from the revaluation of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency fluctuations may cause the us dollar value of our us results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations 
this could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
to minimize the financial impact of these items  the company attempts to contract a significant majority of its services in us dollars 
in addition  the company attempts to minimize its financial impact of these risks  by matching the currency of the company s operating costs with the currency of revenue streams when considered appropriate 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollars 
operational hazards inherent to the offshore marine vessel industry the operation of any marine vessel involves inherent risk that could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately insured or indemnified 
our operations are also subject to various operating hazards and risks  including risk of catastrophic marine disaster  adverse sea and weather conditions  mechanical failure  navigation errors  collisions and property losses to the vessel  damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities  war  sabotage  pirate and terrorism risks  and business interruption due to political action or inaction  including nationalization of assets by foreign governments 
these risks present a threat to the safety of personnel and to our vessels  cargo  equipment under tow and other property  as well as the environment 
any such event may result in a reduction in revenues  increased costs  property damage  and additionally  third parties may have significant claims against us for damages due 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and loss of business 
we carry what we consider to be prudent levels of liability insurance  and our vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss  including war  terrorism acts  and pollution risks  but the company does not fully insure for business interruption 
our insurance coverages are subject to deductibles and certain exclusions 
we can provide no assurance  however  that our insurance coverages will be available beyond the renewal periods  that we will be able to obtain insurance for all operational risks and that our insurance policies will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise 
compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws our global operations require us to comply with a number of us and international laws and regulations  including those involving anti bribery and anti corruption 
in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions  the company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners 
as a us corporation  we are subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit 
we have adopted proactive procedures to promote compliance with the fcpa  but we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the fcpa 
any determination that we have violated the fcpa or any other applicable anti bribery laws in countries in which the company does business could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
a discussion of the company s fcpa internal investigation is disclosed in the completion of internal investigation and settlements with united states and nigerian agencies section of note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
compliance with complex and developing laws and regulations our operations are subject to many complex and burdensome laws and regulations 
stringent federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and the manning  construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations 
many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the united states coast guard and the united states customs and border protection and their foreign equivalents and to regulation by private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping  the oil companies international marine forum  and the international marine contractors association 
our operations are also subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection 
compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment  increased manning or operational changes 
some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances  which could subject the company to liability without regard to whether the company was negligent or at fault 
further  many of the countries in which the company operates have laws  regulations and enforcement systems that are largely undeveloped  and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernible even to experienced and proactive participants 
further  these laws  regulations and enforcement systems can be unpredictable and subject to frequent change or reinterpretation  sometimes with retroactive effect  and with associated taxes  fees  fines or penalties sought from the company based on that reinterpretation or retroactive effect 
while the company endeavors to comply with applicable laws and regulations  the company s compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful  and failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions  imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of the company s operations 
these laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  including charterers or third party agents 
moreover  these laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new  unexpected ways that substantially increase costs that the company may not be able to pass along to its customers 
any changes in laws  regulations or standards that would impose additional requirements or restrictions could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in order to meet the continuing challenge of complying with applicable laws and regulations in jurisdictions where it operates  the company revitalized and strengthened its compliance training  makes available and uses a worldwide compliance reporting system and performs compliance auditing monitoring 
the company 
table of contents 
index to financial statements appointed its general counsel as its chief compliance officer in fiscal to help organize and lead these compliance efforts 
this strengthened compliance program may from time to time identify past practices that need to be changed or remediated 
such corrective or remedial measures could involve significant expenditures or lead to changes in operational practices that could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
risk of changes in laws governing us taxation of foreign source income we operate globally through various subsidiaries which are subject to changes in applicable tax laws  treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business  including laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates 
we determine our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in each jurisdiction for the period during which we operate and earn income 
a material change in the tax laws  tax treaties  regulations or accounting principles  or interpretation thereof  in one or more countries in which we conduct business  or in which we are incorporated or a resident of  could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings  and such change could be significant to our financial results 
in addition  our overall effective tax rate could be adversely and suddenly affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
over of the company s revenues and net income are generated by its operations outside of the united states 
the company s effective tax rate has averaged approximately since fiscal  primarily a result of the passage of the american jobs creation act of  which excluded from the company s current taxable income in the us income earned offshore through the company s controlled foreign subsidiaries 
periodically  tax legislative initiatives are proposed to effectively increase us taxation of income with respect to foreign operations 
whether any such initiatives will win congressional or executive approval and become law is presently unknown  however  if any such initiatives were to become law  and were such law to apply to the company s international operations  it would result in a materially higher tax expense  which would have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  and which could cause the company to review the utility of continued us domicile 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to review and examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities where tax returns are filed 
the company routinely evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes 
we do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority 
if any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure or intercompany transfer pricing policies  or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure  or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country  our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase  and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
compliance with environmental regulations may adversely impact our operations and markets a variety of regulatory developments  proposals and requirements have been introduced and in some cases enacted in the us and various other countries that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other gases 
any such regulations could result in the increased cost of energy as well as environmental and other costs and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the limitations 
these developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for the company s offshore supply vessels  which are highly dependent on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production market 
although it is unlikely that demand for oil and gas will lessen dramatically over the short term  in the long term  increased regulation of environmental emissions may create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources 
unless and until regulations are implemented and their effects are known  we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to compete 
however  any long term material adverse effect on the crude oil and natural gas industry may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

index to financial statements the deepwater horizon incident and the aftereffects of the drilling moratorium in the us gom could have a material impact on exploration and production activities in united states coastal waters the success and profitability of our operations in the united states are dependent on the level of upstream drilling and exploration activity in the us gom  and to a lesser extent on the west coast of the united states and in alaska 
in particular  many of our new build vessels were designed to operate in deep water off the continental shelf to assist in drilling and exploration efforts in that area 
the margins we earn on our deepwater vessels have typically been higher than margins we achieve on other classes of our vessels 
although the boemre is now issuing new drilling permits  the new regulations and requirements could suppress the level of drilling activity and demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our us operations which are part of our americas segment 
in addition  if exploration and production activity migrates from the us gom to international markets because of the these additional regulations and resulting increase in operating costs in the us gom  it is also possible that other offshore supply vessel owners will redeploy their respective vessels to international markets where we operate 
these mobilizations would increase competition and thus could negatively affect our vessel utilization and day rates in international markets  depending on the number of drilling rigs that exit the us gom and move to international markets 
also among the uncertainties that confront the industry are whether congress will repeal the million cap for non reclamation liabilities under the oil pollution act of and whether insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost and with reasonable policy limits to support drilling and exploration activity in the us gom 
although the eventual outcome of these developments is currently unknown  we believe that  even in the best case for the industry that we serve  additional regulatory and operational costs will be incurred  and these additional costs may either reduce the level of exploratory activity in the us gom  reduce demand for our services  or both

the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s future results of operations could differ materially from its historical results or those anticipated in its forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this report 
with respect to this section  the cautionary language applicable to such forward looking statements described in forward looking statements found before item of this report is incorporated by reference into this item the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures of this report 
fiscal business highlights and key focus during fiscal the company continued to focus on enhancing its competitive advantages and its market share in international markets  and continued to modernize its vessel fleet to increase future earnings capacity while removing from active service certain older  or traditional  vessels that currently have more limited market opportunities 
key elements of the company s strategy continue to be the preservation of its strong financial position and the maintenance of adequate liquidity to fund the expansion of its fleet of newer vessels 
operating management focused on safe operations  minimizing unscheduled vessel downtime  and maintaining disciplined cost control 
the company s strategy includes the continuing assessment of opportunities to acquire vessels and or companies that own and operate offshore supply vessels as well as organic growth through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide 
the company has the largest number of new psvs  anchor handling towing supply and towing supply vessels among its competitors in the industry  but it also has the largest fleet of older vessels in the industry 
management regularly evaluates alternatives for its older fleet 
the company intends to pursue its long term fleet replenishment and modernization strategy on a disciplined basis and  in each case  will carefully consider whether proposed investments and transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
the company s revenue during fiscal increased million  or  over the revenues earned during fiscal primarily driven by the overall increases in utilization and average day rates experienced in fiscal due to the increased number of newer and more sophisticated vessels in the company s fleet 
the company s consolidated net earnings also increased  or million during fiscal this disproportionate increase in net earnings as compared to revenue is due  in part  to a million non cash goodwill impairment charge million after tax  or per share recorded during the second quarter of fiscal on the company s middle east north africa segment as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part i  item of this report 
the increases in revenues were accompanied by increases to vessel operating costs which increased  or million  overall during fiscal as compared to fiscal crew costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily because of the company s increased vessel utilization in the current year and the overall higher cost of personnel necessary to operate the company s vessels 
repair and maintenance cost increased  or million  during fiscal and is attributable to a greater number of scheduled and unscheduled routine repair and maintenance activities and dry dockings 
other vessel operating costs increased million  or  during the same comparative periods 
the company also experienced increases in depreciation and amortization of  or million  due to the higher costs associated with the company s newer  more sophisticated vessels 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  related to administrative benefits  incentive compensation and the settlement of a supplemental retirement plan of the former chief executive officer of the company 
due to a smaller number of vessels sold and a higher number of vessel impairments recognized during fiscal as compared to fiscal  the current year had million  or  less gains on asset dispositions  net

we continued our vessel construction and acquisition program during fiscal that had begun in calendar year this program facilitated the company s entrance into deepwater markets around the world in addition to allowing the company to begin to replace its core towing supply supply fleet with fewer  larger  and more technologically sophisticated vessels in order to meet our customers needs 
the vessel construction and acquisition program was initiated with the intent of strengthening the company s presence in all major oil and gas producing regions of the world through the replacement of aging vessels in the company s core fleet 
during this time  the company has purchased and or constructed vessels at a total cost of approximately billion 
between april and march  the company also disposed  primarily through vessel sales to buyers that operate outside of our industry  vessels 
most of the vessel sales were at prices that exceeded their carrying values 
in aggregate  proceeds from  and pre tax gains on  vessel dispositions during this period approximated million and million  respectively 
in recent years  the company has generally funded vessel additions with operating cash flow  and funds provided by the july private placement of million  the september private placement of million  the august  private placement of million in senior unsecured notes  borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and million of bank term loan and various leasing arrangements 
at march   the company had agreements to acquire two vessels and commitments to build vessels at a number of different shipyards around the world at a total cost  including contract costs and other incidental costs  of approximately million 
at march   the company had invested million in progress payments towards the construction of these vessels and two vessel acquisitions 
at march   the remaining expenditures necessary to complete construction of the vessels currently under construction based on contract prices and to fund the acquisition of the two vessels was million

macroeconomic environment and outlook the primary driver of our business and revenues is the level of our customers capital and operating expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production 
these expenditures  in turn  generally reflect our customers expectations for future oil and natural gas prices  economic growth  hydrocarbon demand and estimates of current and future oil and natural gas production 
the prices of crude oil and natural gas are critical factors in exploration and production e p companies decisions to contract drilling rigs and offshore service vessels in the various international markets or the us gom  with the various international markets being largely driven by supply and demand for crude oil  and the us gom being influenced both by the supply and demand for natural gas primarily in regards to shallow water activity and the supply and demand for crude oil primarily in regards to deepwater activity 
the price of crude oil decreased dramatically during the beginning of the fiscal year and subsequently rebounded due to better than anticipated economic news from china and several other developing countries  as well as the less than expected deceleration of the us economy  primarily attributable to positive developments in housing and labor markets 
there are  however  risks to the tenuous recovery such as continued contraction in the euro zone markets  which based on recent political events suggest that the sovereign debt crisis could continue to have negative effects on the global economy for the upcoming year  as well as continued tensions in the middle east and north africa 
looking forward  some economists believe that oil demand for the upcoming year will be unchanged from there is significant growth expected from china and other developing countries while us demand is expected to remain stable  however  there are also factors exerting significant downward pressure on demand forecasts  including the possibility that instability of the euro may lead to a deeper recession in europe and the failure of us political leadership to agree on fiscal priorities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements tidewater anticipates that its longer term utilization and day rate trends for its vessels will be correlated with demand for and the price of crude oil  which in april  was trading around per barrel for west texas intermediate wti crude and around per barrel for intercontinental exchange ice brent crude 
high crude oil prices generally bode well for increases in drilling and exploration activity  which would support increases in demand for the company s vessels  both in the various global markets and the deepwater sectors of the us gom 
throughout fiscal  natural gas prices trended higher due to stronger heating demand than in prior year as well as unexpected decreases in production during winter months 
although higher in recent months  natural gas prices continue to be relatively weak due to the rise in production of unconventional gas resources in north america in part due to increases in onshore shale production resulting from technological advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing and the commissioning of a number of new  large  liquefied natural gas lng exporting facilities around the world  which have contributed to an oversupplied natural gas market 
toward the end of fiscal  the price of natural gas trended higher as a prolonged and colder than expected winter increased demand 
as of the end of march  natural gas was trading in the us at approximately per mcf which is up from approximately per mcf in march oversupplied natural gas inventories in the us continue to exert downward pricing pressures on natural gas prices in the us prolonged periods of oversupply of natural gas whether from conventional or unconventional natural gas production or gas produced as a byproduct of crude oil production will likely continue to suppress prices for natural gas  although over the longer term  relatively low natural gas prices may also lead to increased demand for the resource 
high onshore gas production along with a prolonged downturn in natural gas prices can negatively impact the offshore exploration and development plans of e p companies  which in turn  would suppress demand for offshore support vessel services  primarily in the americas segment specifically our us operations where natural gas is the more prevalent exploitable hydrocarbon resource 
certain oil and gas industry analysts are reporting in their e p expenditures both land based and offshore surveys that global capital expenditure budgets for e p companies are forecast to increase by at least over calendar year levels 
the surveys forecast that international capital spending budgets will increase approximately while north american capital spending budgets are forecast to increase less than as compared to prior year 
it is anticipated by these analysts that the north american capital budget increases will primarily be spent onshore rather than offshore  while international e p spending is expected to be largely offshore  with the strongest markets expected to include latin america  the middle east  russia  europe and asia 
capital expenditure budgets incorporated into the spending surveys were based on an approximate wti and brent average prices per barrel of oil 
although e p companies are using an approximate per mcf average natural gas price for their capital budgets  natural gas directed drilling is forecast to decline due to weak natural gas prices 
deepwater activity continues to be a significant segment of the global offshore crude oil and natural gas markets  and it is also a source of growth for the company 
deepwater activity in non us markets did not experience significant negative effects from the global economic recession  largely because deepwater oil and gas development typically involves significant capital investment and multi year development plans 
such projects are generally underwritten by the participating exploration  field development and production companies using relatively conservative assumptions relating to crude oil and natural gas prices 
these projects are  therefore  considered less susceptible to short term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
during the past few years  worldwide rig construction increased as rig owners capitalized on the high worldwide demand for drilling and low shipyard and financing costs 
reports published by ihs petrodata at the end of march indicate that the worldwide movable offshore drilling rig count  estimated at approximately  approximately of which are designed to operate in deeper waters  will increase with approximately new build offshore rigs that are on order and under construction  most of which will be delivered within the next three years 
of the estimated movable offshore rigs worldwide  approximately are working as of march  it is further estimated that approximately of the new build rigs are being built to operate in deeper waters  suggesting that the number of rigs designed to operate in deeper waters could grow in the coming years to nearly of the market 
investment is also being made in the floating production unit market  with approximately new floating production units under construction and expected to be delivered primarily over the next three years to supplement the approximately floating production units already in existence worldwide 

table of contents 
index to financial statements according to ihs petrodata  the global offshore supply vessel market at the end of march had new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels  anchor handlers and towing supply vessels only under construction  most of which are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market within the next two and one half years 
as of the end of march  the worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at  vessels  of which tidewater estimates more than are stacked 
an increase in worldwide vessel capacity would tend to have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly when there are lower levels of exploration  field development and production activity 
the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry  however  also has a large number of aged vessels  including approximately vessels  or  of the worldwide offshore fleet  that are at least years old and nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives 
these older vessels  approximately one third of which tidewater estimates are already stacked  could potentially be removed from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be determined with certainty  the company believes that the retirement of a sizeable portion of these aged vessels could mitigate the potential combined negative effects of new build vessels on vessel utilization and vessel pricing 
additional vessel demand could also be created by the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units that are expected to be delivered and become operational over the next few years  which should help minimize the possible negative effects of the new build offshore support vessels being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
principal factors that drive our revenues the company s revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are largely dependent upon the activity level of its offshore marine vessel fleet 
as is the case with many others in our industry  our business activity is largely dependent on the level of drilling and exploration activity of our customers 
our customers business activity  in turn  is dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices  which fluctuate depending on expected future levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas  and on estimates of the cost to find  develop and produce reserves 
the company s revenues in all segments are driven primarily by the company s fleet size  vessel utilization and day rates 
because a sizeable portion of the company s operating costs and its depreciation does not change proportionally with changes in revenue  the company s operating profit is largely dependent on revenue levels 
principal factors that drive our operating costs operating costs consist primarily of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance and loss reserves  fuel  lube oil and supplies and vessel operating lease expense 
fleet size  fleet composition  geographic areas of operation  supply and demand for marine personnel  and local labor requirements are the major factors which affect overall crew costs in all segments 
in addition  the company s newer  more technologically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels ahts and platform supply vessels psvs generally require a greater number of specially trained  more highly compensated fleet personnel than the company s older  smaller and less sophisticated vessels 
competition for skilled crew personnel has intensified as new build support vessels currently under construction increase the number of technologically sophisticated offshore vessels operating worldwide 
it is expected that crew cost will likely increase as competition for skilled personnel intensifies 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by expectations of future customer demand for our vessels  as well as vessel age and drydockings mandated by regulatory agencies 
a certain number of periodic drydockings are required to meet regulatory requirements 
the company will generally incur drydocking costs only if economically justified  taking into consideration the vessel s age  physical condition  contractual obligations  current customer requirements and future marketability 
when the company elects to forego a required drydocking  it stacks and occasionally sells the vessel because it is not permitted to work without valid regulatory certifications 
when the company drydocks a productive vessel  the company not only foregoes vessel revenues and incurs drydocking costs  but also continues to incur vessel operating and depreciation costs 
in any given period  vessel downtime associated with drydockings and major repairs and maintenance can have a significant effect on the company s revenues and operating costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements at times  vessel drydockings take on an increased significance to the company and its financial performance 
older vessels may require more frequent and more expensive repairs and drydockings 
newer vessels generally those built after  which now account for a majority of the company s revenues and vessel margin vessel revenues less vessel operating costs  can also require expensive drydockings  even in the early years of a vessel s useful life  due to the larger relative size and greater relative complexity of these vessels 
conversely  when the company stacks vessels  the number of drydockings in any period could decline 
the combination of these factors can create volatility in period to period drydock costs  which are primarily included in repair and maintenance expense  and incrementally increase the volatility of the company s revenues and operating income  thus making period to period comparisons of financial results more difficult 
although the company attempts to efficiently manage its fleet drydocking schedule  changes in the demand for and supply of shipyard services can result in heavy workloads at shipyards and inflationary pressure on shipyard pricing 
in recent years  increases in drydocking costs and days off hire due to vessels being drydocked have contributed to volatility in repair and maintenance costs and vessel revenue 
in addition  some of the more recently constructed vessels are now experiencing their first or second required regulatory drydockings 
insurance and loss reserves costs are dependent on a variety of factors  including the company s safety record and pricing in the insurance markets  and can fluctuate over time 
the company s vessels are generally insured for up to their estimated fair market value in order to cover damage or loss resulting from marine casualties  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions  and property losses to the vessel 
the company also purchases coverage for potential liabilities stemming from third party losses with limits that it believes are reasonable for its operations 
insurance limits are reviewed annually and third party coverage is purchased based on the expected scope of ongoing operations and the cost of third party coverage 
fuel and lube costs can also fluctuate in any given period depending on the number and distance of vessel mobilizations  the number of active vessels off charter  drydockings  and changes in fuel prices 
the company also incurs vessel operating costs that are aggregated as other vessel operating costs 
these costs consist of brokers commissions  training costs and other miscellaneous costs 
brokers commissions are incurred primarily in the company s non united states operations where brokers sometimes assist in obtaining work for the company s vessels 
brokers generally are paid a percentage of day rates and  accordingly  commissions paid to brokers generally fluctuate in accordance with vessel revenue 
other costs include  but are not limited to  satellite communication fees  agent fees  port fees  canal transit fees  vessel certification fees  temporary vessel importation fees and any fines or penalties

americas segment operations 
americas based vessel revenues increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal although americas based vessel revenue increased modestly during the comparative periods  increases in revenues generated by the deepwater vessels were offset by lower revenues generated by the towing supply supply and other vessel classes 
revenues on the deepwater vessels increased  or million  during the comparative periods  due to a increase in average day rates  and due to an increased number of deepwater vessels operating in the area as a result of newly delivered vessels and because deepwater vessels transferred into the americas segment from other segments 
revenue from the towing supply supply vessel classs decreased  or million  during the same comparative periods  due to fewer towing supply supply vessels operating in the americas segment as a result of vessels being stacked during the fiscal year 
revenue for the other vessel class decreased million  or  due to a fewer number of other vessels operating in this segment due to vessel sales 
total utilization rates for the americas based vessels increased two percentage points  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  however  this increase is partially a result of the sale of older  stacked vessels from the americas fleet during this two year period with a significant number of those vessels sold near the end of fiscal vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works by the number of days the vessel is available to work 
as such  stacked vessels depressed utilization rates during the comparative periods because stacked vessels are considered available to work  and as such  are included in the calculation of utilization rates 
within the americas segment  the company continued to stack  and in some cases  dispose of  vessels that could not find attractive charters 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had americas based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked seven additional vessels  reactivated one vessel and sold one vessel from the previously stacked vessel fleet  resulting in a total of stacked americas based vessels as of march  vessel operating profit for the americas based vessels decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a  or million  increase in vessel operating costs primarily repair and maintenance costs and other vessel costs and a  or million  increase in

revenues on the deepwater vessels increased million  or  during the same comparative periods  due to a increase in average date rates and a percentage point increase in utilization rates  respectively 
increases in average day rates for deepwater vessels were primarily due to addition of newer vessels in the segment and the renewal of contracts at higher rates 
also  revenue on the towing supply supply vessels increased million  or  due to a percentage point increase in utilization rates 
increases in utilization for these vessel classes was the result of under utilized vessels in the segment put to work following the resolution of delays on certain customer projects at the end of fiscal increases in average day rates for deepwater vessels were primarily due to addition of newer vessels in the segment and the renewal of contracts at higher rates

asia pacific segment operations 
asia pacific based vessel revenues decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a five percentage point decrease in utilization rates on the towing supply supply class of vessels as a result of weaker demand  particularly for older equipment within this class of vessels and because of vessels transferred out of the segment  which collectively resulted in a million decrease in vessel revenues on the asia pacific region s non deepwater towing supply supply class of vessels 
revenues on the deepwater vessels also declined million due to a two percentage point decrease in utilization rates on the deepwater vessels operating in this segment  largely due to unanticipated delays on certain customer projects

vessel day rates are determined by the demand created largely through the level of offshore exploration  field development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided may also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
as such  stacked vessels depressed utilization rates because stacked vessels are considered available to work  and as such  are included in the calculation of utilization rates 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated on all vessels in service which includes stacked vessels and vessels in drydock but do not include vessels withdrawn from service two vessels at march  or vessels owned by joint ventures vessels at march

these increases were partially offset by decreases in professional expenses 
general and administrative expenses were higher by approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from pay raises for administrative personnel  higher accruals for incentive bonuses  an increase in costs associated with foreign assigned administrative employees specifically foreign income taxes paid by the company on behalf of expatriate employees  higher legal fees associated with various legal matters as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and other liquidity matters below  and higher office and property expenses primarily office rent and information technology costs 
in addition  other general and administrative expenses  during fiscal  were lower than fiscal  because fiscal included a million settlement with the department of justice doj and a million settlement with the federal government of nigeria fgn as discussed below  and as a result of a release of approximately million workers compensation reserves because of positive workers compensation loss experience 
liquidity  capital resources and other matters the company s current ratio  level of working capital and amount of cash flows from operations for any year are primarily related to fleet activity  vessel day rates and the timing of collections and disbursements 
vessel activity levels and vessel day rates are  among other things  dependent upon the supply demand relationship for offshore vessels  which tend to follow the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production 
variations from year to year in these items are primarily the result of market conditions 
availability of cash at march   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  of which million was held by foreign subsidiaries 
the company currently intends that earnings by foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions in order to fund strategic initiatives such as investment  expansion and acquisitions  fund working capital requirements and repay debt both third party and intercompany of its foreign subsidiaries in the normal course of business 
moreover  the company does not currently intend to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the united states because cash generated from the company s domestic businesses and credit available under its domestic financing facilities  as well as the repayment of intercompany liabilities from foreign subsidiaries  are currently sufficient and are expected to continue to be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund the cash needs of its operations in the united states 
however  if  in the future  cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund the company s operations in the united states  the repatriation of such amounts to the united states could result in a significant incremental tax liability in the period in which the decision to repatriate occurs 
payment of any incremental tax liability would reduce the cash available to the company to fund its operations by the amount of taxes paid 
our objective in financing our business is to maintain adequate financial resources and access to sufficient levels of liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents  future net cash provided by operating activities and the company s revolving credit facilities provide the company  in our opinion  with sufficient liquidity to meet

decreases in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities are primarily attributable to increases in trade receivables of million due to  million cash collections resulting from the timing of payments from customers and  million billings to customers due to an increase in business activity as well as increases in other receivables of million 
increases to other receivables are primarily attributable to statutory changes in a country in our sub sarahan africa europe segment which require payments to non domestic companies be processed through local banks and a payment issue relating to our operations in another country in our sub saharan africa europe segment regarding a dispute with our previous marketing agent 
it should be noted that the company is in a cyclical business and payments from customers frequently slow during periods of declining activity as some customers will seek to reduce their investment in working capital by delaying payments to service and equipment providers 
payment delays can also occur during a start up phase on new projects and with new customers 
in addition  changes in local regulations can also delay customer payments 
however  there are no known material adverse trends in collections of trade receivables and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for bad debts

other liquidity matters vessel construction 
with its commitment to modernizing its fleet through its vessel construction and acquisition program over the past decade  the company is replacing its older fleet of vessels with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels  while also enhancing the size and capabilities of the company s fleet 
these efforts will continue  with the company anticipating that it will use its future operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacity and new borrowings or lease arrangements to fund current and future commitments in connection with the fleet renewal and modernization program 
the company continues to evaluate its fleet renewal program  whether through new construction or acquisitions  relative to other investment opportunities and uses of cash  including the current share repurchase authorization  and in the context of current conditions in the credit and capital markets 
at march   the company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  there was million of credit facilities available at march   of which million was held by foreign subsidiaries and is not expected to be repatriated 
currently the company is experiencing substantial delay with one fast supply boat under construction in brazil that was originally scheduled to be delivered in september on april   pursuant to the vessel construction contract  the company sent the subject shipyard a letter initiating arbitration in order to resolve disputes of such matters as the shipyard s failure to achieve payment milestones  its failure to follow the construction schedule  and its failure to timely deliver the vessel 
the company has suspended construction on the vessel and both parties continue to pursue that arbitration 
the company has third party credit support in the form of insurance coverage for of the progress payments made on this vessel  or all but approximately million of the carrying value of the accumulated costs through march  the company generally requires shipyards to provide third party credit support in the event that vessels are not completed and delivered in accordance with the terms of the shipbuilding contracts 
that third party credit support typically guarantees the return of amounts paid by the company  and generally takes the form of refundment guarantees or standby letters of credit issued by major financial institutions located in the country of the shipyard 
while the company seeks to minimize its shipyard credit risk by requiring these instruments  the ultimate return of amounts paid by the company in the event of shipyard default is still subject to the creditworthiness of the shipyard and the provider of the credit support  as well as the company s ability to successfully pursue legal action to compel payment of these instruments 
when third party credit support is not available or cost effective  the company endeavors to limit its credit risk by requiring cash deposits and through other contract terms with the shipyard and other counterparties 
two vessels under construction at a domestic shipyard have fallen substantially behind their original delivery schedule 
the shipyard notified the company that the shipyard should be entitled to a delay in the delivery dates and an increase in the contract price for both vessels because the company was late in completing and providing the shipyard with detailed design drawings of the vessel 
the detailed design drawings were developed for the company by a third party designer 
while the company believes that other factors also contributed to the delay  the company and the shipyard reached an agreement during the quarter ended december  which includes an increase in the contract price of each vessel  one or more change orders for each hull  among other modifications to the contract terms and the extension of the delivery dates of the two vessels by approximately seven and eight months  respectively 
merchant navy officers pension fund 
a subsidiary of the company is a participating employer in an industry wide multi employer retirement fund in the united kingdom  known as the merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf 
the company has been informed by the trustee of the mnopf that the fund has a deficit that will require contributions from the participating employers 
the amount and timing of the subsidiary company s share of the fund s deficit depends on a number of factors  including updated calculations of the total fund deficit  theories of contribution imposed as determined by and within the scope of the trustee s authority  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the number of then participating solvent employers  and the final formula adopted to allocate the required contribution among such participating employers 
the amount payable to mnopf based on assessments was million and million at march  and  respectively  all of which has been accrued 
the company recorded million and million of additional liabilities during fiscal and  respectively 
payments totaling million and million were paid to the fund during fiscal and  respectively 
the fund s trustee may claim that the subsidiary company owes additional amounts for various reasons  including negative fund investment returns or the inability of other assessed participating employers to contribute their share of respective allocations  failing which  the company and other solvent participating employers will be asked for additional contributions 
in january the fund s trustee announced that there was an additional deficit in the fund 
the trustee will claim the subsidiary company and other participating employers owe additional contributions to the fund for the period march to march the trustee s expectation in january was that this amount would be invoiced around september and that arrangements for payments in installments starting in could be achieved subject to certain criteria and conditions 
the amount of the contribution by the subsidiary company for the to valuation is presently estimated at approximately million 
the company has not made any provisions for this additional obligation  pending receipt of the actual notification  which is anticipated in september brazilian customs 
in april  two brazilian subsidiaries of tidewater were notified by the customs office in macae  brazil that they were jointly and severally being assessed fines of million brazilian reais approximately million as of march  
the assessment of these fines is for the alleged failure of these subsidiaries to obtain import licenses with respect to tidewater vessels that provided brazilian offshore vessel services to petrobras  the brazilian national oil company  over a three year period ending december after consultation with its brazilian tax advisors  tidewater and its brazilian subsidiaries believe that vessels that provide services under contract to the brazilian offshore oil and gas industry are deemed  under applicable law and regulations  to be temporarily imported into brazil  and thus exempt from the import license requirement 
the macae customs office has now  without a change in the underlying applicable law or regulations  taken the position that the temporary importation exemption is only available to new  and not used  goods imported into brazil and therefore it was improper for the company to deem its vessels as being temporarily imported 
the fines have been assessed based on this new interpretation of brazilian customs law taken by the macae customs office 
after consultation with its brazilian tax advisors  the company believes that the assessment is without legal justification and that the macae customs office has misinterpreted applicable brazilian law on duties and customs 
the company is vigorously contesting these fines which it has neither paid nor accrued and  based on the advice of its brazilian counsel  believes that it has a high probability of success with respect to the overturn of the entire amount of the fines  either at the administrative appeal level or  if necessary  in brazilian courts 
in december  an administrative appeals board issued a decision that disallowed million brazilian reais approximately million as of march  of the total fines sought by the macae customs office 
a secondary administrative appeals board recently considered fines totaling million brazilian reais approximately million as of march  
this secondary board rendered a decision on april  that disallowed all of those fines 
the remaining fines totaling million brazilian reais approximately million as of march  are still subject to a secondary board hearing  but the company believes that the april decision will be helpful in that upcoming hearing 
the secondary board decision disallowing the fines totaling million brazilian reais is  however  still subject to the possibility of further administrative appeal by the authorities that imposed the initial fines 
the company believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
potential for future brazilian state tax assessment 
the company is aware that a brazilian state in which the company has operations has notified two of the company s competitors that they are liable for unpaid taxes and penalties and interest thereon for failure to pay state import taxes with respect to vessels that such competitors operate within the coastal waters of such state pursuant to charter agreements 
the import tax being asserted is equal to a percentage which could be as high as for vessels entering that state s waters prior to december  and thereafter of the affected vessels declared values 
the company understands that the two companies involved are contesting the assessment through administrative proceedings before the taxing authority 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s two brazilian subsidiaries have not been similarly notified by the brazilian state that it has an import tax liability related to its vessel activities imported through that state 
although the company has been advised by its brazilian tax counsel that substantial defenses would be available if a similar tax claim were asserted against the company  if an import tax claim were to be asserted  it could be for a substantial amount given that the company has had substantial and continuing operations within the territory of the state although the amount could fluctuate significantly depending on the administrative determination of the taxing authority as to the rate to apply  the vessels subject to the levy and the time periods covered 
in addition  under certain circumstances  the company might be required to post a bond or other adequate security in the amount of the assessment plus any interest and penalties if it became necessary to challenge the assessment in a brazilian court 
the statute of limitations for the brazilian state to levy an assessment of the import tax is five years from the date of a vessel s entry into brazil 
the company has not yet determined the potential tax assessment  and according to the brazilian tax counsel  chances of defeating a possible claim notification from the state authorities in court are probable 
to obtain legal certainty and predictability for future charter agreements and because the company was importing three vessels to start new charters in brazil  the company filed three suits on august   april  and jan   respectively  against the brazilian state and judicially deposited the respective state tax for these newly imported vessels 
as of march   no accrual has been recorded for any liability associated with any potential future assessment for previous periods based on management s assessment  after consultation with brazilian counsel  that a liability for such taxes was not probable 
equatorial guinea customs 
in december  the customs department of equatorial guinea assessed a million fine against the company for alleged customs violations 
after considering certain factual and legal arguments made by the company  the customs department reduced the fine to million in march  the reduced fine amount relates to two company vessels that were operating in equatorial guinea as of december the customs department contends that the company has been operating vessels in equatorial guinea without appropriate temporary importation approvals 
equatorial guinea  like many countries  has a customs regime which permits companies to import temporarily equipment into the country without paying customs as long as such equipment is not intended to be permanently located in the country 
according to the customs department  the company failed to make the proper filings to qualify its vessels for temporary importation status 
the size of the reduced fine is apparently based on the book value of the two company vessels multiplied by a penalty factor of two 
the company is still assessing the underlying legal and factual basis for the reduced fine  but it disagrees both with the underlying claims of the customs department and the arbitrary and unjustifiable size of the assessment 
we are actively engaged in discussions with the customs department to resolve the issue 
in those discussions  customs department officials have stated a willingness to settle the reduced fine for a much lower amount 
the company does not have enough information available to it at this time to reasonably estimate the potential financial impact of the reduced fine  even if a fine is ultimately paid  and no reserve has been established at this time against this exposure 
shareholder derivative suit 
the company has previously disclosed that in mid february  an individual claiming to be a tidewater shareholder filed a shareholder derivative suit in the us district court for the eastern district of louisiana 
the defendants in the suit were individual directors and certain officers of tidewater inc tidewater inc was also a nominal defendant in the lawsuit 
additional information regarding the substance of the allegations made in the lawsuit are disclosed in the company s q for the quarter ended december under the heading part ii  item legal proceedings shareholder derivative suit 
on july   the presiding judge in this case  judge milazzo  dismissed the shareholder derivative suit but gave the plaintiff an opportunity to file an amended complaint 
on july  and in lieu of filing an amended complaint  the plaintiff filed a motion to stay the district court proceedings pending resolution of a demand the plaintiff had made on that same day on the company s board of directors to conduct an independent investigation and bring claims against the individual defendants 
on august   the individual defendants and the company filed oppositions to the motion to stay and sought dismissal of the suit with prejudice 
on march   judge milazzo issued a ruling denying the plaintiff s motion to stay and rendered a judgment dismissing the derivative action with prejudice 
the time period for appealing the judge s ruling has now passed without an appeal by the plaintiff

legal proceedings 
on march   tidewater filed suit in the london commercial court against tidewater s nigerian marketing agent for breach of the agent s obligations under contractual agreements between the parties 
the alleged breach involves actions of the nigerian marketing agent to discourage various affiliates of total sa from paying approximately million due to the company for vessel services performed in nigeria 
shortly after the london commercial court filing  total commenced interpleader proceedings in nigeria naming the nigerian agent and the company as respondents and seeking an order which would allow total to deposit those monies with a nigerian court for the respondents to resolve

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures and disclosures of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical experience and other assumptions and information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty  and accordingly  these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes 
as a result  actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions 
we suggest that the company s nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is important to the portrayal of our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above 
revenue recognition our primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis  therefore  vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis generally three months to three years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to three months 
vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
there are no material differences in the costs structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term  for the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract

our principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies 
we routinely review and evaluate our accounts receivable balances for collectability 
the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that our customer will not make the required payments  which results in a reduction in our receivable balance 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required

goodwill goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets of companies acquired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level using carrying amounts as of december or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the company has the option of assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
in the event that a qualitative assessment indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the two step impairment test is not necessary 
if  however  the assessment of qualitative factors indicates otherwise  the standard two step method for evaluating goodwill for impairment as prescribed by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other must be performed 
step one involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than the fair value  the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step two involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one 
the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates

at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing is performed if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include prolonged adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the quarter ended december  and determined there was no goodwill impairment  however  the excess of estimated fair value over the carrying value of the asia pacific segment was less than of the related carrying value 
goodwill associated with this reporting unit totaled approximately million at march  
table of contents 
index to financial statements impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the vessels in its active fleet for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
with respect to vessels that have not been stacked  we group together for impairment testing purposes vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics 
we also subdivide our groupings of assets with similar operating and marketing characteristics between our older vessels and newer vessels 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of expected future market performance  which  in turn  is based on industry trends 
if an asset group fails the undiscounted cash flow test  the company uses the discounted cash flow method to determine the estimated fair value of each asset group and compares such estimated fair value  considered level  as defined by asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to the carrying value of each asset group in order to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
the primary estimates and assumptions used in reviewing active vessel groups for impairment include utilization rates  average dayrates  and average daily operating expenses 
these estimates are made based on recent actual trends in utilization  dayrates and operating costs and reflect management s best estimate of expected market conditions during the period of future cash flows 
these assumptions and estimates have changed considerably as market conditions have changed and they are reasonably likely to continue to change as market conditions change in the future 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce materially different results 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis in order to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
in addition to the periodic review of its active long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service every six months or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may not be recoverable 
management estimates each stacked vessel s fair value by considering items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked  likelihood of a return to active service  actual recent sales of similar vessels  among others 
in certain situations we obtain an estimate of the fair value of the stacked vessel from third party appraisers or brokers 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a vessel withdrawn from service or a stacked vessel exceeds its estimated fair value 
the estimates of fair value of stacked vessels are also subject to significant variability  are sensitive to changes in market conditions  and are reasonably likely to change in the future 
the company has consistently recorded modest gains on the sale of stacked vessels 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining the company s income tax provisions  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
in addition  the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
as a global company  we are subject to the jurisdiction of taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases actual income before taxes  deemed profits which are generally determined using a percentage of revenue rather than profits and withholding taxes based on revenue 
determination of taxable income in any tax jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
the company is periodically audited by various taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which it operates internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on the company s present belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record or adjust valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for changes to valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the present need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in every five year period  and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
while the actual length of time between drydockings can vary  we use a month amortization period for the costs of these drydockings as an average time between the required certifications 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
accrued property and liability losses the company self insures a portion of potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
we are exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount we expect to receive and utilizes third party actuaries to estimate losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
reinsurance recoverable balances are monitored regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and we record adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the accounting for these plans is subject to guidance regarding employers accounting for pensions and employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined using a number of assumptions  of which the discount rates used to measure future obligations  expenses and expected long term return on plan assets are most critical 
less critical assumptions  such as  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates  health care cost trends  and other assumptions  also have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension costs consists of service costs  
table of contents 
index to financial statements interest costs  expected returns on plan assets  amortization of prior service costs or benefits and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  which are evaluated at least annually  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
the company also sponsors a post retirement plan that provides limited health care and life insurance benefits to qualified retired employees 
costs of the program are based on actuarially determined amounts and are accrued over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees who are expected to qualify for these benefits 
this plan is not funded

effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  field development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
the company s newer technologically sophisticated ahts vessels and psvs generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the company s older  smaller vessels 
competition for skilled crews will likely intensify  particularly in international markets  as new build vessels currently under construction enter the global fleet 
concerns regarding shortages in skilled labor become an increasing concern globally  during calendar year  global wages in the energy industry have risen approximately per analyst reports 
increases in local wages is another developing trend regarding wage inflation  especially in south america where local wages have trended higher and are now on par or have exceeded wages earned by the expatriate employee work force 
if competition for personnel intensifies  the market for experienced crews could exert upward pressure on wages  which would likely increase the company s crew costs 
strong fundamentals in the global energy industry experienced in the past few years have also increased the activity levels at shipyards worldwide until the calendar year global recession 
the price of steel then peaked in due to increased worldwide demand for the metal  which demand has since declined due to the weakening of steel consumption and global economic industrial activity as a whole 

if the price of steel declines  the cost of new vessels will result in lower capital expenditures and depreciation expenses  which taken by themselves would increase our future operating profits 
environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunction and other sanctions 
compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change however  and may impose increasingly strict requirements and  as such  the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations 
the company is also involved in various legal proceedings that relate to asbestos and other environmental matters 
in the opinion of management  based on current information  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
