item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements congress passed the private securities litigation act of to encourage corporations to provide investors with information about the company s anticipated future financial performance  goals  and strategies 
the act provides a safe haven for such disclosure  in other words  protection from unwarranted litigation if actual results are not the same as management expectations 
united desires to provide its shareholders with sound information about past performance and future trends 
consequently  any forward looking statements contained in this report  in a report incorporated by reference to this report  or made by management of united in this report  in any other reports and filings  in press releases and in oral statements  involve numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by united s statements for a variety of factors including  but not limited to changes in economic conditions  business conditions in the banking industry  movements in interest rates  competitive pressures on product pricing and services  success and timing of business strategies  the nature and extent of governmental actions and reforms  and rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards 
introduction the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in financial condition and the results of operations of united and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated below 
this discussion and the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of united bankshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated 
management has evaluated all significant events and transactions that occurred after december   but prior to the date these financial statements were issued  for potential recognition or disclosure required in these financial statements 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this document 
in addition  on july   united completed its acquisition of centra financial holdings  inc centra of morgantown  west virginia 
the results of operations of centra are included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
as a result  the comparisons for the year of to the same time period of are impacted by increased levels of average balances  income  expense  and asset quality results due to the acquisition 
at consummation  centra had assets of approximately billion  loans of billion  deposits of billion and shareholders equity of million 
application of critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united conform with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments  which are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors  are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses  the valuation of investment securities and the related other than temporary impairment analysis  and the calculation of the income tax provision to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by united are presented in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
determining the allowance for credit losses requires management to make forecasts of losses that are highly uncertain and require a high degree of judgment 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million and is subject to periodic adjustment based on management s assessment of current probable losses in the loan portfolio 
such adjustment from period to period can have a significant impact on united s consolidated financial statements 
to illustrate the potential effect on the financial statements of our estimates of the allowance for loan losses  a increase in the allowance for loan losses would have required million in additional allowance funded by additional provision for credit losses  which would have negatively impacted the year of net income by approximately million  or diluted per common share 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and the appropriate provision for credit losses is based upon a quarterly evaluation of the loan portfolio and lending related commitments 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates  including estimates related to the amounts and timing of future cash flows  value of collateral  losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which are susceptible to constant and significant change 
the allowance allocated to specific credits and loan pools grouped by similar risk characteristics is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary based upon subsequent changes in circumstances 
in determining the components of the allowance for credit losses  management considers the risk arising in part from  but not limited to  charge off and delinquency trends  current economic and business conditions  lending policies and procedures  the size and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  concentrations of credit  and other various factors 
the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses is described in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the factors leading to changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk  see item  under the caption of loan concentrations in this form k 
investment securities accounting estimates are used in the presentation of the investment portfolio and these estimates impact the presentation of united s financial condition and results of operations 
united classifies its investments in debt and equity securities as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities held to maturity are accounted for using historical costs  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
securities available for sale are accounted for at fair value  with the net unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax effects  presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
when available  fair values of securities are based on quoted prices or prices obtained from third party vendors 
third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data 
prices obtained from third party vendors that do not reflect forced liquidation or distressed sales are not adjusted by management 
where prices reflect forced liquidation or distressed sales  as is the case with united s portfolio of pooled trust preferred securities  management estimates fair value based on a discounted cash flow methodology using appropriately adjusted discount rates reflecting nonperformance and liquidity risks 
due to the subjective nature of this valuation process  it is possible that the actual fair values of these securities could differ from the estimated amounts  thereby affecting united s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the potential impact to united s financial position  results of operations or cash flows for changes in the valuation process cannot be reasonably estimated 
if the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost  the investment is considered impaired and management evaluates whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
if such an event or change has occurred  management must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie  temporary or other than temporary in order to apply the appropriate accounting treatment 
if united intends to sell  or is more likely than not will be required to sell an impaired debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings 
the amount recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if united does not intend to sell  and is not more likely than not they will be required to sell the impaired debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is separated into the following the amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and the amount related to all other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
given the recent disruptions in the financial markets  the decision to recognize other than temporary impairment on investment securities has become more difficult as complete information is not always available and market conditions and 
table of contents other relevant factors are subject to rapid changes 
therefore  the other than temporary impairment assessment has become a critical accounting policy for united 
for additional information on management s consideration of investment valuation and other than temporary impairment  see note c and note t  notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes united s calculation of income tax provision is inherently complex due to the various different tax laws and jurisdictions in which we operate and requires management s use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
the current income tax liability also includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions as required in asc topic  income taxes 
changes to the estimated accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates  implementation of new business strategies  resolution of issues with taxing authorities and recently enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
these changes can be material to the company s operating results for any particular reporting period 
the analysis of the income tax provision requires the assessments of the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions  filing positions  filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other information 
united strives to keep abreast of changes in the tax laws and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense 
united is also subject to audit by federal and state authorities 
because the application of tax laws is subject to varying interpretations  results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from united s estimates and provisions 
united continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of probable exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
the potential impact to united s operating results for any of the changes cannot be reasonably estimated 
see note l  notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding united s asc topic disclosures 
use of fair value measurements united determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in asc topic  whereby the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
asc topic establishes a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs in the methodology for determining fair value are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market based information obtained from independent sources level or level  while unobservable inputs reflect management s estimate of market data level 
for assets and liabilities that are actively traded and have quoted prices or observable market data  a minimal amount of subjectivity concerning fair value is needed 
prices and values obtained from third party vendors that do not reflect forced liquidation or distressed sales are not adjusted by management 
when quoted prices or observable market data are not available  management s judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
at december   approximately of total assets  or million  consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value 
of this total  approximately or million of these financial instruments used valuation methodologies involving observable market data  collectively level and level measurements  to determine fair value 
approximately or million of these financial instruments were valued using unobservable market information or level measurements 
most of these financial instruments valued using unobservable market information were pooled trust preferred investment securities classified as available for sale 
at december   only million or less than of total liabilities were recorded at fair value 
this entire amount was valued using methodologies involving observable market data 
united does not believe that any changes in the unobservable inputs used to value the financial instruments mentioned above would have a material impact on united s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
see note t for additional information regarding asc topic and its impact on united s financial statements 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is further discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents compared to financial condition summary united s total assets as of december  were billion which was a decrease of million or less than from december  the decrease was primarily the result of a million or decrease in cash and cash equivalents  a million or decrease in investment securities and a million or decrease in other assets 
partially offsetting these decreases in total assets was an increase in portfolio loans of million or and an increase of million or in loans held for sale 
the decrease in total assets is reflected in a corresponding decrease in total liabilities of million or less than while shareholders equity increased million or 
the decrease in total liabilities was due mainly to a million decrease in deposits  and a million decrease in long term borrowings  which were partially offset by increases of million and million in short term borrowings and accrued expenses and other liabilities  respectively 
the following discussion explains in more detail the changes in financial condition by major category 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at december  decreased million or from year end of this total decrease  interest bearing deposits with other banks decreased million or as united placed less excess cash in an interest bearing account with the federal reserve 
partially offsetting this decrease in interest bearing deposits with other banks is a million or increase in cash and due from banks and a thousand or increase in federal funds sold 
during the year of  net cash of million was provided by operating activities 
net cash of million and million were used in investing activities and financing activities  respectively 
further details related to changes in cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
securities total investment securities at december  decreased million or from year end securities available for sale decreased million or 
this change in securities available for sale mainly reflects billion in sales  maturities and calls of securities  billion in purchases  and an increase of million in market value 
securities held to maturity decreased million or from year end due primarily to calls and maturities of securities 
other investment securities decreased million or from year end due to the redemption of federal home loan bank fhlb stock 
the following is a summary of available for sale securities at december in thousands us treasury and obligations of us government corporations and agencies states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities asset backed securities marketable equity securities trust preferred collateralized debt obligations single issue trust preferred securities corporate securities total available for sale securities  at amortized cost total available for sale securities  at fair value 
table of contents the following is a summary of held to maturity securities at december in thousands us treasury and obligations of us government corporations and agencies states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities single issue trust preferred securities other corporate securities total held to maturity securities  at amortized cost total held to maturity securities  at fair value at december   gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were million 
securities in an unrealized loss position at december  consisted primarily of pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations trup cdos  single issue trust preferred securities and non agency residential mortgage backed securities 
the trup cdos and the single issue trust preferred securities relate mainly to securities of financial institutions 
as of december   united s mortgage backed securities had an amortized cost of million  with an estimated fair value of million 
the portfolio consisted primarily of million in agency residential mortgage backed securities with a fair value of million and million in non agency residential mortgage backed securities with an estimated fair value of million 
as of december   united s asset backed securities had an amortized cost of million  with an estimated fair value of million 
as of december   united s corporate securities had an amortized cost of million  with an estimated fair value of million 
the portfolio consisted primarily of million in pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of million and million in single issue trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of million 
in addition to the trust preferred securities  the company held positions in various other corporate securities  including marketable equity securities  with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million  only one of which was individually significant 
the pooled trust preferred securities consisted of positions in different securities 
the underlying issuers in the pools were primarily financial institutions and to a lesser extent  insurance companies 
the company has no exposure to real estate investment trusts reits in its investment portfolio 
the company owns both senior and mezzanine tranches in pooled trust preferred securities  however  the company does not own any income notes 
the senior and mezzanine tranches of trust preferred collateralized debt obligations generally have some protection from defaults in the form of over collateralization and excess spread revenues  along with waterfall structures that redirect cash flows in the event certain coverage test requirements are failed 
generally  senior tranches have the greatest protection  with mezzanine tranches subordinated to the senior tranches  and income notes subordinated to the mezzanine tranches 
senior tranches represent million of the company s pooled securities  while mezzanine tranches represent million 
of the million in mezzanine tranches  million are now in the senior position as the senior notes have been paid to a zero balance 
as of december   million of the pooled trust preferred securities were investment grade  million were split rated  and the remaining million were below investment grade 
in terms of capital adequacy  the company allocates additional risk based capital to the below investment grade securities 
as of december   united s single issue trust preferred securities had an amortized cost of million 
of the million  million or were investment grade  thousand or were unrated  million or were split rated  and million or were below investment grade 
the two largest exposures accounted for of the million 
these included wells fargo at million and suntrust bank at million 
all single issue trust preferred securities  with the exception of two securities totaling thousand  are currently receiving full scheduled principal and interest payments 
during the year of  united recognized net other than temporary impairment charges totaling million on certain trup cdos and non agency residential mortgage backed securities  which are not expected to be sold 
other than these securities  management does not believe that any other individual security with an unrealized loss as of december  is other than temporarily impaired 
united believes the decline in value resulted from changes in market interest rates  credit 
table of contents spreads and liquidity  not an adverse change in the expected cash flows 
based on a review of each of the securities in the investment portfolio  management concluded that it was not probable that it would be unable to realize the cost basis investment and appropriate interest payments on such securities 
united has the intent and the ability to hold these securities until such time as the value recovers or the securities mature 
however  united acknowledges that any impaired securities may be sold in future periods in response to significant  unanticipated changes in asset liability management decisions  unanticipated future market movements or business plan changes 
more information relating to investment securities is presented in note c  notes to consolidated financial statements 
loans loans held for sale increased million or as loan originations exceeded loan sales in the secondary market during the year of portfolio loans  net of unearned income  increased million or from year end mainly due to a million or increase in the total commercial  financial and agricultural loans category 
within the commercial  financial and agricultural loans category  commercial real estate loans increased million or while commercial loans not secured by real estate increased million or 
partially offsetting these increases in portfolio loans was a decrease of million or in residential real estate loans 
a summary of loans outstanding is as follows december commercial  financial agricultural residential real estate construction land development consumer less unearned interest total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net loans held for sale the following table shows the maturity of commercial  financial  and agricultural loans and real estate construction and land development loans as of december  less than one to over in thousands one year five years five years total commercial  financial agricultural construction land development total at december   commercial  financial and agricultural loans and real estate construction and land development loans by maturity are as follows less than one to over in thousands one year five years five years total outstanding with fixed interest rates outstanding with adjustable rates more information relating to loans is presented in note d  notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other assets other assets decreased million or from year end due mainly to a million decrease in income tax receivable and a million decrease in united s net pension asset due to a decline in the discount rate used in the year end valuation and a less than expected return on the plan assets 
in addition  deferred tax assets decreased million  oreo decreased million  prepaid regulatory assessments decreased million and core deposit intangibles decreased million due to amortization 
partially offsetting these decreases from year end was an increase of million in cash surrender values of bank owned life insurance policies 
deposits deposits represent united s primary source of funding 
total deposits at december  remained flat  decreasing million or less than from year end in terms of composition  noninterest bearing deposits increased million or while interest bearing deposits decreased million or from december  the increase in noninterest bearing deposits was due mainly to increases in commercial noninterest bearing deposits of million or and personal noninterest bearing deposits of million or 
partially offsetting these increases was a million or decrease in public noninterest bearing deposits 
the decrease in interest bearing deposits was due mainly to a million or decrease in interest bearing mmdas  a million or decrease in time deposits under  and a million or decrease in time deposits over  due in large part to historically low interest rates 
the million decrease in interest bearing mmdas is mainly due to a million or decrease in personal mmdas  a million or decrease in commercial mmdas and a million or decrease in public funds mmdas 
the million decrease in time deposits under  is the result of fixed rate certificate of deposits cds declining million 
the million decrease in time deposits over  is due to a million decrease in deposit account registry service cdars balances over  and a million decrease in fixed rate cds over  partially offsetting these decreases in interest bearing deposits was a million or increase in interest bearing checking deposits due to increases in state and municipal interest bearing checking accounts of million  personal interest bearing checking accounts of million and commercial interest bearing checking accounts of million

borrowings total borrowings at december  were flat  decreasing thousand or less than during the year of since year end  short term borrowings increased million or due to a million increase in overnight fhlb advances  which was partially offset by a million decrease in federal funds purchased and a million decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
long term borrowings decreased million or since year end due mainly to a net repayment of million in long term fhlb advances

accrued expenses and other liabilities accrued expenses and other liabilities at december  increased million or from year end in particular  income taxes payable increased million due to higher earnings while other accrued expenses increased million due mainly to an accrual of million with respect to a litigation settlement related to overdraft claims against united 
in addition  united s net pension asset declined due to a decline in the discount rate used in the year end valuation and a less than expected return on the plan assets  resulting in a million liability at year end partially offsetting these increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities was a million decrease in interest payable due to a decline in long term borrowings and interest bearing time deposits 
shareholders equity shareholders equity at december  increased million or from december  as united continued to balance capital adequacy and the return to shareholders 
the increase in shareholders equity was due mainly to earnings net of dividends which equaled million for the year of accumulated other comprehensive income increased million or due mainly to an increase of million  net of deferred income tax  in the fair value of united s available for sale investment portfolio 
in addition  the accretion of pension costs for the year of was million while the after tax non credit portion of otti losses for the year of was million 
partially offsetting these increases to accumulated other comprehensive income is an after tax adjustment to united s pension asset resulting in a decline of million 
earnings summary net income for the year was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for the year of united s return on average assets for the year of was and return on average shareholders equity was as compared to and for the year of as previously stated  united completed its acquisition of centra during the third quarter of as a result  comparisons for the year of to the same time period in are impacted by increased levels of average balances  income  and expense due to the acquisition 
the results for the year of included an accrual of million with respect to a settlement of claims asserted in class actions against united bank  inc of west virginia 
in addition  the results for year of included noncash  before tax  other than temporary impairment charges of million on certain investment securities 
the results for the year of included before tax  other than temporary impairment charges of million on certain investment securities 
net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the prior year

noninterest expense was million  an increase of million or for the year of when compared to income tax expense for the year of was million as compared to million for the year of united s effective tax rate was approximately and for years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to for the following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations by major category 

table of contents net interest income net interest income represents the primary component of united s earnings 
it is the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these assets 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in market interest rates 
such changes  and their impact on net interest income in and  are presented below 
net interest income for the year of was million  which was an increase of million or from the year of the million increase in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased million while total interest expense declined million from the year of for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
the tax equivalent basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
although this is a non gaap measure  united s management believes this measure is more widely used within the financial services industry and provides better comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
united uses this measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage its balance sheet composition 
tax equivalent net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of the net interest margin for the year of was  down basis points from a net interest margin of for the year of tax equivalent interest income for the year of was million  a million or increase from the year of this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average earning assets from the centra acquisition 
average earning assets increased million or from the year of average net loans increased million or for the year of partially offsetting the increases to tax equivalent interest income for the year of was a decline of basis points in the average yield on earning assets as compared to the year of the average yield on earning assets was for the year of and for the year of in addition  average investments for the year of decreased million or from the year of due to sales  calls and maturities 
interest expense for the year of was million  a decrease of million or from the year of the decline in interest expense for the year of was attributable to a decrease of basis points in the average cost of funds for the year of as a result of lower market interest rates 
in particular  the average cost of interest bearing deposits was  a decline of basis points from for the year of and the average cost of long term borrowings was for the year of  a decrease of basis points from for the year of in addition  united repaid approximately million in long term borrowings 
partially offsetting these decreases to interest expense was an increase of million or in average interest bearing liabilities due mainly to increases of million and million  respectively  in average interest bearing deposits and short term borrowings

provision for loan losses at december   nonperforming loans were million or of loans  net of unearned income compared to nonperforming loans of million or of loans  net of unearned income at december  the components of nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis and loans whose terms have been restructured for economic or legal reasons due to financial difficulties of the borrowers 
loans past due days or more were million at december   an increase of million or from million at year end the increase in loans past due days or more was primarily due to an increase in commercial past due relationships 
at december   nonaccrual loans were million  an increase of million or from million at year end the increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to the deterioration in financial condition of two large relationships which necessitated transfer of the relationships to nonaccrual status 
restructured loans were million at december  as compared to million at year end the decrease in restructured loans was mainly due to the repayment of a restructured consumer loan 
the loss potential on these loans has been properly evaluated and allocated within united s allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate acquired in foreclosure or other settlement of loans oreo

the following table summarizes nonperforming assets for the indicated periods

a restructured loan with a balance of thousand at december  was past due days or more  but was not included in the loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  and are still accruing interest category 
loans are designated as impaired when  in the opinion of management  the collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan contract is doubtful 
at december   impaired loans were million  which was a decrease of million or from the million in impaired loans at december  this decrease in impaired loans was due mainly to decreased outstanding principal associated with impaired loans in the company s non owner occupied commercial real estate  residential real estate and construction and land development portfolios as a result of repayment of principal through the sale of associated collateral combined with improved borrower collateral positions which led to reduction of impairments 
the loss potential on these loans has been properly evaluated and allocated within united s allowance for loan losses 
for further details on impaired loans  see note e  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united maintains an allowance for loan losses and a reserve for lending related commitments 
the combined allowance for loan losses and reserve for lending related commitments is referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million as compared to million at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million as compared to million at december  as a percentage of loans  net of unearned income  the allowance for loan losses was at december  and of loans  net of unearned income at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans or coverage ratio was and at december  and december   respectively 
for united  this ratio at december  decreased from the ratio at december  because nonperforming loans increased million or while the allowance for loan losses was relatively flat from year end adjustments to risk grades and qualitative risk factors within the allowance for loan loss analysis were based on delinquency and loss trends of such loans and resulted in increased allowance allocations of million or 
the increased allocations did not increase the overall level of the reserve because of a decrease in the estimate for imprecision of million 
the decrease in the estimate for imprecision is attributable to refined methodology utilized by the bank to fully allocate amounts reserved for losses inherent in the bank s portfolio 
the company s detailed methodology and analysis indicated an increase in the allocated allowance for loan losses primarily due to increased loss allocations on impaired loans 
for the years ended december  and  the provision for loan losses was million and million  respectively

certain loan amounts were reclassified in prior years to conform with the new disclosure rules about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses in accounting standards codification asc topic united evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and lending related commitments 
united s process for evaluating the allowance is a formal company wide process that focuses on early identification of potential problem credits and procedural discipline in managing and accounting for those credits 
this process determines the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses  allocation among loan types and lending related commitments  and the resulting provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses and a provision for lending related commitments included in other expenses 
allocations are made for specific commercial loans based upon management s estimate of the borrowers ability to repay and other factors impacting collectibility 
other commercial loans not specifically reviewed on an individual basis are evaluated based on historical loss percentages applied to loan pools that have been segregated by risk 
allocations for loans other than commercial loans are made based upon historical loss experience adjusted for current environmental conditions 
the allowance for credit losses includes estimated probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates  and risk 
table of contents factors that have not yet fully manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  a portion of the allowance accounts for the inherent imprecision in the allowance for credit losses analysis 
the following table presents the allocation of united s allowance for credit losses for each of the five years ended december in thousands commercial  financial agricultural residential real estate construction land development consumer allowance for estimated imprecision allowance for loan losses reserve for lending related commitments allowance for credit losses certain loan amounts were reclassified in to conform with the new disclosure rules about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses in accounting standards codification asc topic the following is a summary of loans outstanding as a percent of total loans at december commercial  financial agricultural residential real estate construction land development consumer total certain loan amounts were reclassified in prior years to conform with the new disclosure rules about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses in accounting standards codification asc topic united s formal company wide review of the allowance for loan losses at december  produced increased allocations in four of the six loan categories 
the allowance allocated to commercial real estate nonowner occupied loans increased by million due to an increase in historical loss rates and outstanding loan balances 
the allocation related to the residential real estate loan pool increased by million due to an increase in historical loss rates  as well as the consumer loan pool which experienced an increase in allocation of thousand due to an increase in historical loss rates 
the commercial real estate owner occupied loan pool allocation increased by thousand due to an increase in historical loss rates and specific allocation for impaired loans 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in the other commercial loan pool allocation of thousand driven by a combination of lower outstanding balances and a decrease in specific allocations for floorplan lending 
the real estate construction and development allocation decreased thousand due to a change in qualitative factors within the allowance calculation 
in summary  the overall level of the allowance for loan losses was stable in comparison to year end as a result of offsetting factors within the portfolio as described above 
an allowance is established for probable credit losses on impaired loans via specific allocations 
nonperforming commercial loans and leases are regularly reviewed to identify impairment 
a loan or lease is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts contractually due 
measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates  and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 
impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan s effective rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the selected measure is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment has occurred 
the allowance for impaired loans was million at december  and million at december  compared to the prior year end  this element of the allowance increased by million primarily due to increased specific allocations for the nonowner occupied commercial real estate  other commercial loan  and real estate construction and development loan pools 

table of contents an allowance is also recognized for imprecision inherent in loan loss migration models and other estimates of loss 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses and reserve for lending related commitments  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its methodology for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors to identify and quantify probable losses in the portfolio  the process includes subjective elements and is therefore susceptible to change 
this estimate for imprecision has been established to recognize the variance  within a reasonable margin  of the loss estimation process 
the estimate for imprecision decreased at december  by million to thousand 
this estimate for imprecision represents of the company s total allowance for credit losses and in as much as this variance approximates a pre determined narrow parameter  the methodology has confirmed that the company s allowance for credit losses is at an appropriate level 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses on existing loans and lending related commitments based on information currently available 
united s loan administration policies are focused on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in terms of loan approval and credit quality 
the commercial loan portfolio is monitored for possible concentrations of credit in one or more industries 
management has lending limits as a percentage of capital per type of credit concentration in an effort to ensure adequate diversification within the portfolio 
most of united s commercial loans are secured by real estate located in west virginia  southeastern ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  maryland and the district of columbia 
it is the opinion of management that these commercial loans do not pose any unusual risks and that adequate consideration has been given to these loans in establishing the allowance for credit losses 
management is not aware of any potential problem loans  trends or uncertainties  which it reasonably expects  will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources which have not been disclosed 
additionally  management has disclosed all known material credits  which cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment schedules 
other income other income consists of all revenues  which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving united s profitability 
recognizing the importance  management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced 
noninterest income was million for the year of  up million or from the year of net losses on investment securities transactions for the year of were million compared to net losses of million for the year of included in net losses on investment securities for the year of were before tax other than temporary impairment charges of million on certain investment securities consisting primarily of million on pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations trup cdos and million on collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and a before tax  net gain of thousand on the sale of investment securities 
included in net losses on investment securities for the year of were before tax other than temporary impairment charges of million on certain investment securities consisting primarily of million on pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations trup cdos and million on collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and a before tax  net gain of million on the sale of investment securities 
excluding the results of the investment security transactions  noninterest income for the year of would have increased million or from the year of revenue from trust income and brokerage commissions increased million or due mainly to increased brokerage volume and the value of assets under management 
united continues its efforts to broaden the scope and activity of its trust and brokerage service areas  especially in the northern virginia market  to provide additional sources of fee income that complement united s traditional banking products and services 
the northern virginia market provides a relatively large number of potential customers with high per capita incomes 
mortgage banking income increased million or due to increased mortgage loan production and sales in the secondary market during the year of as compared to mortgage loan sales were million in as compared to million in 
table of contents fees from deposit services were million for the year of which was relatively flat from the year of  decreasing thousand or less than 
in particular  automated teller machine atm fees decreased million and overdraft or insufficient funds nsf fees declined thousand 
virtually offsetting these declines were increases in check card income of million and account analysis fees of thousand 
income from bank owned life insurance policies decreased thousand or due mainly to a smaller increase in the cash surrender values of the insurance policies in as compared to fees from bankcard transactions increased thousand or as compared to the year of due to a higher volume of transactions 
other income decreased thousand or for the year of as compared to last year s income mainly due to a decrease of thousand from derivatives not in a hedging relationship as a result of a change in value 
a corresponding amount of expense is included in other expense in the income statement 
other expense just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced  it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations to reduce costs 
other expense includes all items of expense other than interest expense  the provision for credit losses and income tax expense 
noninterest expense for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of this increase was mainly the result of the centra merger 
employee compensation for the year of increased million or from the year of due mainly to the additional employees from the centra merger 
also included in employee compensation was expense for stock options of million for the year of as compared to million for the year of employee benefits expense increased million or due mainly an increase of million in pension expense due to a change in the discount rate used in the valuation process 
also  health insurance expense increased thousand and federal insurance contributions act fica expense increased thousand due mainly to the additional employees from centra 
united uses certain valuation methodologies to measure the fair value of the assets within united s pension plan which are presented in note m  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the funded status of united s pension plan is based upon the fair value of the plan assets compared to the projected benefit obligation 
the determination of the projected benefit obligation and the associated periodic benefit expense involves significant judgment and estimation of future employee compensation levels  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
if united assumes a increase or decrease in the estimation of future employee compensation levels while keeping all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
if united assumes a increase or decrease in the discount rate while keeping all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
if united assumes a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets while keeping all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
net occupancy expense increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of the higher net occupancy expense for was due mainly to the additional offices acquired from centra 
in particular  building rental expense increased thousand  real property taxes increased thousand  building maintenance increased thousand  and building depreciation increased thousand

equipment expense increased thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of due to a higher depreciation and maintenance expense as a result of the centra merger 
data processing expense increased thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of due to the additional processing as a result of the centra merger and the conversion to a new servicer 
bankcard processing fees increased thousand or as a result of higher volume of transactions 
fdic insurance expense decreased million or for the year of as compared to the year of due mainly to lower premiums 

table of contents other expenses increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of this increase was due mainly to the previously mentioned accrual of million with respect to class actions against united bank  inc of west virginia 
the additional increase from the year of was due mainly to higher general operating expenses as a result of the centra merger

noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of thousand or from the fourth quarter of merger expenses of thousand related to the acquisition of centra were included in the results for the fourth quarter of in addition  equipment expense for the fourth quarter of declined thousand due to lower amounts of maintenance and depreciation expense 
partially offsetting these amounts were increases of thousand and thousand in employee compensation and benefits expense  respectively 
additional quarterly financial data for and may be found in note v  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation united s income statements generally reflect the effects of inflation 
since interest rates  loan demand and deposit levels are impacted by inflation  the resulting changes in the interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included in net interest income 
similarly  operating expenses such as salaries  rents and maintenance include changing prices resulting from inflation 
one item that would not reflect inflationary changes is depreciation expense 
subsequent to the acquisition of depreciable assets  inflation causes price levels to rise  therefore  historically presented dollar values do not reflect this inflationary condition 
with inflation levels at relatively low levels and monetary and fiscal policies being implemented to keep the inflation rate increases within an acceptable range  management expects the impact of inflation would continue to be minimal in the near future 
the effect of regulatory policies and economic conditions united s business and earnings are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
united s business and earnings are also affected by general and local economic conditions 
for most of and  certain credit markets experienced difficult conditions and volatility 
downturns in the credit market can cause a decline in the value of certain loans and securities  a reduction in liquidity and a tightening of credit 
a downturn in the credit market often signals a weakening economy that can cause job losses and thus distress on borrowers and their ability to repay loans 
uncertainties in credit markets and the economy present significant challenges for the financial services industry 
regulatory policies and economic conditions have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future  however  united cannot accurately predict the nature  timing or extent of any effect such policies or economic conditions may have on its future business and earnings 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements united has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
the table below presents  by payment date  significant known contractual obligations to third parties as of december  total payments due by period in thousands three to total one year or less one to three years five years over five years deposits without a stated maturity time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings operating leases excludes interest 
includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
the interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon interest rates in effect at december  the interest to be paid on variable rate obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates  which materially affect the contractual obligation amounts to be paid 
excludes carrying value adjustments such as unamortized premiums or discounts 
as of december   united recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  of million 
this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that united has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  this estimated liability is excluded from the contractual obligations table 
united also enters into derivative contracts  mainly to protect against adverse interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities  under which it is required to either pay cash to or receive cash from counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value and not notional value on the consolidated balance sheet 
because the derivative contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  they are excluded from the preceding table 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note p  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
united s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for the loan commitments and standby letters of credit is the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
united uses the same policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 

table of contents the following table details the amounts of significant commitments and letters of credit as of december  in thousands amount commitments to extend credit revolving open end secured by residential credit card and personal revolving lines commercial total unused commitments financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total letters of credit commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses  generally within one year  and may require the payment of a fee 
further discussion of commitments is included in note o  notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity in the opinion of management  united maintains liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and the credit needs of its customers 
like all banks  united depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets 
a significant source of funds available to united is core deposits 
core deposits include certain demand deposits  statement and special savings and now accounts 
these deposits are relatively stable and they are the lowest cost source of funds available to united 
short term borrowings have also been a significant source of funds 
these include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as well as advances from the fhlb 
repurchase agreements represent funds that are obtained as the result of a competitive bidding process 
liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash 
all banks must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near cash items to meet the day to day demands of customers and united s cash needs 
other than cash and due from banks  the available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary sources of liquidity 
the goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding that enables united to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and meet united s cash needs 
liquidity is managed by monitoring funds availability from a number of primary sources 
substantial funding is available from cash and cash equivalents  unused short term borrowings  and a geographically dispersed network of branches providing access to a diversified and substantial retail deposit market 
short term needs can be met through a wide array of outside sources such as correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of federal home loan bank advances 
other sources of liquidity available to united to provide long term as well as short term funding alternatives  in addition to fhlb advances  are long term certificates of deposit  lines of credit  borrowings that are secured by bank premises or stock of united s subsidiaries and issuances of trust preferred securities 
in the normal course of business  united through its asset liability committee evaluates these as well as other alternative funding strategies that may be utilized to meet short term and long term funding needs

noninterest expense was million  an increase of million or for the year of when compared to income tax expense for the year of was million as compared to million for the year of united s effective tax rate was approximately and for years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to for the following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations by major category 
net interest income net interest income for the year of was higher than the year of due mainly to a lower amount of average interest bearing liabilities due to the net repayment of fhlb advances at the end of and the beginning of as well as an increase in average earnings assets as a result of the centra merger 
generally  prior to the centra merger  net interest income had declined in from the same time periods in as interest income has declined more than interest expense 
the lower amount of net interest income had been due largely to a decrease in average earning assets as a result of less loan demand due to current economic conditions and a lack of desirable reinvestment options for securities as they mature or are called 
yields on earning assets have also declined from due to lower reinvestment rates on loans and securities as a result of historically low market interest rates 
united has been able to lower its funding costs on deposits and short term borrowings from due to these lower market interest rates even to the point of outpacing the decline in the yield on earning assets 
net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of the million increase in net interest income occurred because total interest income declined million while total interest expense declined million from the year of for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
the tax equivalent basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
although this is a non gaap measure  united s management believes this measure is more widely used within the financial services industry and provides better comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
united uses this measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage its balance sheet composition 
tax equivalent net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of the net interest margin for the year of was  up basis points from a net interest margin of for the year of tax equivalent interest income for the year of was million  a million or decrease from the year of 
table of contents this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of basis points in the average yield on earning assets for the year of as compared to the year of partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in average earning assets of million or for the year of due to the centra merger 
average net loans increased million or for the year of while average investments decreased million or 
average short term investments increased million or as a result of united placing its excess cash in an interest bearing account with the federal reserve

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of united s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within united s policy guidelines 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposures due to changes in economic conditions  interest rate levels and customer preferences 
interest rate risk management considers interest rate risk to be united s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in united s net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
united s earnings are largely dependent on the effective management of interest rate risk 
management of interest rate risk focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits 
united s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk to maintain an acceptable level of change to net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
policy established for interest rate risk is stated in terms of the change in net interest income over a one year and two year horizon given an immediate and sustained increase or decrease in interest rates 
the current limits approved by the board of directors are structured on a staged basis with each stage requiring specific actions 
united employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its exposure to changing interest rates 
one such technique utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes executive management projections for activity levels in product lines offered by united 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
rate scenarios could involve parallel or nonparallel shifts in the yield curve  depending on historical  current  and expected conditions  as well as the need to capture any material effects of explicit or embedded options 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management s strategies 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or liabilities that mature or are repriced within a designated time frame 
the principal function of managing interest rate risk is to maintain an appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market interest rates 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified periods of time is known as the gap 
earnings simulation analysis captures not only the potential of these interest sensitive assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
moreover  earnings simulation analysis considers the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
united closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an on going basis and projects the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin 

table of contents the following table shows united s estimated consolidated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  and change in interest rates percentage change in net interest income basis points december  december  given an immediate  sustained basis point upward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated that net interest income for united would increase by over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a basis point immediate  sustained upward shock in the yield curve would increase net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a basis point immediate  sustained downward shock in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december  as compared to a decrease of over one year as of december  with the federal funds rate at at december  and  management believed a basis point immediate  sustained decline in rates was highly unlikely 
this analysis does not include the potential increased refinancing activities  which should lessen the negative impact on net income from falling rates 
while it is unlikely market rates would immediately move or basis points upward or downward on a sustained basis  this is another tool used by management and the board of directors to gauge interest rate risk 
all of these estimated changes in net interest income are and were within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
to further aid in interest rate management  united s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the use of fhlb advances provides united with a low risk means of matching maturities of earning assets and interest bearing funds to achieve a desired interest rate spread over the life of the earning assets 
in addition  united uses credit with large regional banks and trust preferred securities to provide funding 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  united may use derivative instruments to protect against adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities and on future cash flows 
these derivatives commonly consist of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  collars  futures  forward contracts  written and purchased options 
interest rate swaps obligate two parties to exchange one or more payments generally calculated with reference to a fixed or variable rate of interest applied to the notional amount 
united accounts for its derivative activities in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
extension risk at december   united s mortgage related securities portfolio had an amortized cost of million  of which approximately million or were fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
these fixed rate cmos consisted primarily of planned amortization class pacs  sequential pay and accretion directed vadms bonds having an average life of approximately years and a weighted average yield of  under current projected prepayment assumptions 
these securities are expected to have very little extension risk in a rising rate environment 
current models show that an immediate  sustained upward shock of basis points in rates  the average life of these securities would only extend to years 
the projected price decline of the fixed rate cmo portfolio in rates up basis points would be  less than the price decline of a year treasury note 
by comparison  the price decline of a year current coupon mortgage backed security mbs for an immediate  sustained upward shock of basis points would be approximately 
united had approximately million in year mortgage backed securities with a projected yield of and a projected average life of years as of december  this portfolio consisted of seasoned year mortgage paper with a weighted average loan age wala of years and a weighted average maturity wam of years
