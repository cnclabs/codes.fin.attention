competition we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete against companies that have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us 
in certain markets  we compete against national and regional firms against which we may not be price competitive

contract provisions and subcontracting most of our revenue is derived from engineering  construction and epc contracts 
the majority of our contracts fall into the following basic categories 
table of contents firm fixed price or lump sum fixed price contracts  providing for a single price for the total amount of work  cost plus fixed fee contracts where income is earned solely from the fee received  unit price contracts  which specify a price for each unit of work performed  time and materials contracts where personnel and equipment are provided under an agreed upon schedule of daily rates with other direct costs being reimbursable  and a combination of the above including lump sum payment for certain items and unit rates for others 
changes in scope of work are subject to change orders to be agreed upon by both parties 
change orders not agreed to in either scope or price result in claims to be resolved in a dispute resolution process 
these change orders and claims can affect our contract revenue either positively or negatively 
we usually obtain contracts through either competitive bidding or negotiations with long standing clients 
we are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by our clients who maintain approved bidder lists 
bidders are pre qualified on the basis of their prior performance for such clients  as well as their experience  reputation for quality  safety record  financial strength and bonding capacity 
in evaluating bid opportunities  we consider such factors as the client and their geographic location  the difficulty of the work  current and projected workload  the likelihood of additional work  the project s cost and profitability estimates  and our competitive advantage relative to other likely bidders 
the bid estimate forms the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project control system  enabling management to monitor projects effectively 
all us government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client 
in addition  some contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements that require us to pay liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances within our control 
we act as the primary contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake 
in our capacity as the primary contractor and when acting as a subcontractor  we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only such specialized activities as hazardous waste removal  horizontal directional drills  non destructive inspection  catering and security 
in the construction industry  the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  when acting as the primary contractor  we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
under a fixed price contract  we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project  based upon specific assumptions and project criteria 
if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur  our margins will decrease  possibly resulting in a loss 
the revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks  we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and may incur losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year 
in some cases  we are able to recover additional costs and profits from the client through the change order process 
in general  turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations 
this is a result of the long term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs  and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract 
our accounting policy related to contract variations and claims requires recognition of all costs as incurred 
revenue from change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when an agreement is reached with the client as to the scope of work and when it is probable that the cost of such work will be recovered in a change in contract price 
profit on change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when realization is reasonably assured 
also included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on uncompleted contracts are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs unapproved change orders 
these amounts are recorded at their estimated net realizable value when realization is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
unapproved change orders 
table of contents and claims also involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded unapproved change orders may be made in the near term 
if we do not successfully resolve these matters  a net expense recorded as a reduction in revenues  may be required  in addition to amounts that have been previously provided 
contractual arrangements we provide services under msas and on a project by project basis 
msas are typically one to three years in duration  but can be longer 
under our msas  our customers generally agree to use us to provide certain services in a specified geographic region on stipulated terms and conditions  including pricing and escalation 
however  most of our contracts  including msas and our alliance agreement with oncor  may be terminated by our customers on short notice 
further  although our customers assign work to us under our msas  our customers often have no obligation to assign work to us and are not required to use us exclusively  in some cases subject to our right of first refusal 
in addition  many of our contracts  including our msas  are opened to public bid and generally attract multiple bidders 
work performed under msas is typically billed on a unit price or time and materials basis 
in addition  any work encountered in the course of a unit price project that does not have a defined unit is generally completed on a time and materials basis 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  pricing is typically based on a unit price or fixed price structure 
under our unit price contracts  we agree to perform identified units of work for an agreed price 
a unit can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation 
the resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit 
under fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the contract for a fixed fee based on our estimate of the aggregate costs of completing the particular project 
we are sometimes unable to fully recover cost overruns on our fixed price contracts 
we expect that industry trends could result in an increase in the proportion of our contracts being performed on a unit price or fixed price basis resulting in more profitability risk 
our storm restoration work  which involves high labor and equipment utilization  is typically performed on a time and materials basis and is generally more profitable when performed off system rather than for customers with which we have msas 
our ability to allocate resources to storm restoration work depends on our capacity at that time and permission from existing customers to release some portion of our workforce from their projects 
we attempt to manage contract risk by implementing a standard contracting philosophy to minimize liabilities assumed in the agreements with our clients 
however  there may be contracts or msas in place that do not meet our current contracting standards 
while we have made efforts to improve our contractual terms with our clients  this process takes time to implement 
we have attempted to mitigate the risk by requesting amendments to our contracts and by maintaining primary and excess insurance  with certain specified limits to mitigate our exposure in the event of a loss 
oncor alliance agreement on june   we entered into a non exclusive agreement with oncor 
due to the extensive scope and long duration of the agreement  we refer to it as an alliance agreement 
we summarize below the principal terms of the agreement 
this summary is not a complete description of all the terms of the agreement 
term  renewals and extensions 
the agreement became effective on august  and will continue until expiration on december   unless extended  renewed or terminated in accordance with its terms 
provision of services  spending levels and pricing 
under the agreement  it is anticipated that we will provide oncor transmission construction and maintenance services tcm  and distribution construction and maintenance services dcm  pursuant to fixed price  unit price and time and materials structures 
the fees we charge oncor under unit price and time and materials structures are set forth in the agreement  most of which are adjusted annually according to indices provided in the agreement 
the agreement also includes a provision whereby oncor receives pricing at least as favorable as we charge other customers for any similar services which is not a defined term in the agreement 
management believes  based on our pricing practices and the nature and scope of the services we provide to oncor  that we are in compliance with this provision 
we frequently hold meetings with oncor to discuss its forecasted monthly and annual tcm and dcm spending levels 
the agreement provides for agreed incentives and adjustments for us and for oncor according to oncor s projected spending levels 
calculations based on projected spending levels are subject to subsequent adjustments based on actual spending levels 
the agreement also requires that we provide dedicated resources to oncor and that we meet or exceed minimum service levels as measured by specified performance indicators 
termination 
oncor could in some cases seek to terminate for cause or limit our activity or seek to assess penalties against us under the agreement 
oncor may terminate the agreement upon days notice or any work request thereunder without prior notice in each case at its sole discretion and may terminate the agreement upon days notice in the event there is an announcement of the intent to undertake or an 
table of contents actual occurrence of a change in control of oncor or willbros utility t d holdings  llc 
oncor may also terminate the agreement for cause if  among other things  we breach and fail to adequately cure a representation or warranty under the agreement  we materially or repeatedly default in the performance of our material obligations under the agreement or we become insolvent 
in the event oncor terminates the agreement for convenience or due to an anticipated or actual change of control of oncor  oncor must pay us a termination fee 
in addition  we would have to adjust a significant portion of our existing customer relationship intangible asset attributed to oncor which was recorded in connection with the infrastrux acquisition 
employees at december   we directly employed a multi national work force of  persons  of which approximately percent were citizens of the respective countries in which they work 
although the level of activity varies from year to year  we have maintained an average work force of approximately  over the past five years 
the minimum employment during that period has been  and the maximum was  at december   approximately percent of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe relations with our employees are satisfactory

table of contents we lease other facilities used in our operations  primarily sales shop offices  equipment sites and expatriate housing units in the united states  canada and oman 
rent expense for all leased facilities was approximately  in   in and  in insurance and bonding operational risks are analyzed and categorized by our risk management department and are insured through major international insurance brokers under a comprehensive insurance program  which includes commercial insurance policies  consisting of the types and amounts typically carried by companies engaged in the worldwide engineering and construction industry 
we maintain worldwide master policies written mostly through highly rated insurers 
these policies cover our property  plant  equipment and cargo against all normally insurable risks 
other policies cover our workers and liabilities arising out of our operations 
primary and excess liability insurance limits are consistent with industry standards for the level of our asset base 
risks of loss or damage to project works and materials are often insured on our behalf by our clients 
on other projects  builders all risk insurance is purchased when deemed necessary 
substantially all insurance is purchased and maintained at the corporate level  with the exceptions being certain basic insurance  which must be purchased in some countries in order to comply with local insurance laws 
the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the future  our ability to maintain insurance  which may not be available or at rates we consider reasonable  may be affected by events over which we have no control  such as those that occurred on september  in  we were not constrained by our ability to bond new projects  nor have we been negatively impacted in early global warming and climate change recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
as a result  there have been a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the united states as well as other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
we do not know and cannot predict whether any proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments 
depending on the final provisions of such rules or legislation  it is possible that such future laws and regulations could result in increasing our compliance costs or  capital spending requirements or creating additional operating restrictions on us or our customers 
it is also possible that such future developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels and increase the demand for renewable energy sources  which could adversely affect the demand for some of our services and improve the demand for some of our other services 
likewise  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature  storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change or otherwise will have a material impact on our operations 
compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not  to date  had a material effect on the cost of our operations  earnings or competitive position 
however  as noted above  compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements of existing environmental regulations or requirements may cause us to incur additional costs or subject us to liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
risk factors the nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks 
risks related to our business our business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power companies on infrastructure 
our revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major engineering and construction projects 
the availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power industries  and specifically  the level of capital expenditures of oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power companies on infrastructure 
our failure to obtain major projects  the delay in awards of major projects  the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the under utilization of our resources  which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow 
numerous factors beyond our control influence the level of capital expenditures of these companies  including 
table of contents current and projected oil  gas and electric power prices  as well as refining margins  the demand for gasoline and electricity  the abilities of oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power companies to generate  access and deploy capital  exploration  production and transportation costs  the discovery rate and location of new oil and gas reserves  the sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions  regulatory restraints on the rates that electric power companies may charge their customers  local and international political and economic conditions  the ability or willingness of host country government entities to fund their budgetary commitments  and technological advances 
we face a risk of non compliance with certain covenants in our credit agreement 
we are subject to a number of financial and other covenants under our amended and restated credit agreement  including a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the maximum total leverage ratio decreases from to at december  to to as of march   to as of june  and to as of september  the minimum interest coverage ratio increases from to at december  to to as of december  we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants as of december  however  the margin of compliance was tight  and although our internal forecast indicates that we will continue to comply during  there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these increasingly stringent financial covenants 
in order to ensure compliance with our maximum total leverage ratio and other financial covenants  we may elect to continue to prepay our credit agreement indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale of non strategic assets or with cash on hand 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in disposing of our non strategic assets 
moreover  if our results of operations are weaker than our forecast  we may not have sufficient cash on hand to prepay sufficient credit agreement indebtedness in order to avoid a financial covenant default and fund our working capital requirements 
a default under the amended and restated credit agreement would permit the lenders to terminate their commitment to make cash advances or issue letters of credit  require us to immediately repay any outstanding cash advances with interest and require us to cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations 
if the maturity of our credit agreement indebtedness were accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds to pay such indebtedness 
in such an event  our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness  which includes substantially all of our assets  to the extent permitted by the credit agreement and applicable law 
beginning in july  the interest rate on our borrowings will increase and the total revolving commitment will decrease 
our credit facility expires on june  under our prior credit agreement  amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility bore interest at a eurocurrency rate or a base rate  plus in each case  an applicable margin based on the total leverage ratio 
the margin ranged from percent to percent on eurocurrency rate loans and from percent to percent on base rate loans 
under the amended and restated credit agreement  beginning july   the applicable margin on eurocurrency rate revolving loans increases to percent  and the applicable margin on base rate revolving loans increases to percent  in each case irrespective of the then current total leverage ratio 
in addition  beginning on july   the aggregate amount of commitments under the revolving credit facility will decrease from million to million 
as of december   we had million in outstanding revolver borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding  with million remaining against our million capacity 
subsequent to december   we repaid million of our outstanding borrowings through proceeds received from the sale of willbros middle east limited  which held our operations in oman 

table of contents we believe that additional sales of non strategic assets and cash flow from operations will allow us to operate under the reduced commitment amount of million for the revolving credit facility subsequent to june  we continue to take steps to generate positive operating cash flow and will continue to pursue opportunities to reduce our financial leverage and strengthen our overall balance sheet 
these steps may include additional sales of non strategic and under performing assets including equipment  real property and businesses as well as accessing capital markets to reduce or refinance our indebtedness 
we are also seeking to refinance our credit facility  which expires on june  however  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or refinancing our existing indebtedness  increasing our borrowing capacity or lowering our borrowing costs 
we may be subject to further legal action if we are unable to make payments required of us pursuant to our settlement agreement of the wapco lawsuit 
on march   willbros global holdings  inc  formerly known as willbros group  inc  a panama corporation wghi  which is now one of our subsidiaries and holds a portion of our non us operations  and willbros group  inc wgi entered into a settlement agreement with west african gas pipeline company limited wapco to settle the litigation which was instituted in the london high court by wapco against wghi in the settlement agreement 
in the litigation  wapco had asserted claims against wghi totaling million plus costs and interest 
for additional information regarding this litigation  see note discontinuance of operations  held for sale operations and asset disposals of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
the settlement agreement provides that wghi will make payments to wapco over a period of six years totaling million 
million was due in and has been paid timely 
million is due in and million is due in the remaining million was originally due over the period of   and the settlement agreement also provides that the payments due in these latter years may be accelerated and become payable in whole or in part in the fourth quarter of in the event the company achieves certain metrics the acceleration metrics 
the company achieved one of the acceleration metrics during when it entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that increased its overall indebtedness by million 
as a result  the million in payments that were originally due in years  and have been accelerated and are now due in the fourth quarter of wgi and wghi are jointly and severally liable for payment of the amount due to wapco under the settlement agreement 
wghi and wgi are subject to a penalty rate of interest and collection efforts in the london court in the event they fail to meet any of the payments required by the settlement agreement 
our settlements with the doj and the sec  and the prosecution of former employees  may negatively impact us in the event of a future fcpa violation 
our failure to comply with the fcpa or other anti bribery laws would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in may  after reaching agreement with the company  the doj filed an information and deferred prosecution agreement dpa in the united states district court in houston concluding its investigation into violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa by wg and its subsidiary  willbros international  inc wii 
also in may  we reached a final settlement with the sec to resolve its previously disclosed investigation of possible violations of the fcpa and possible violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these investigations stemmed primarily from our former operations in bolivia  ecuador and nigeria 
the settlements together required us to pay  over approximately three years  a total of million in penalties and disgorgement  plus post judgment interest on million of that amount 
we made the final payments under these settlements in october the criminal information associated with the dpa was dismissed  with prejudice  upon motion filed by the doj and signed by the court on april  with respect to the sec settlement  we are permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws 
our failure to abide by the fcpa and other laws could result in prosecution and other regulatory sanctions and severely impact our operations 
a criminal conviction for violations of the fcpa could result in fines  civil and criminal penalties and equitable remedies  including profit disgorgement and injunctive relief  and would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  the prosecution of former employees may impact our operations or result in legal actions against us  including actions by foreign governments  in countries that are the subject of the settlements 
the settlements could also result in third party claims against us  which may include claims for special  indirect  derivative or consequential damages 

table of contents our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
we cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations  terminations or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn 
many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them  in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits 
therefore  project terminations  suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog 
finally  poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits 
managing backlog in our utility t d segment also has other challenges 
backlog for anticipated projects in this segment is determined based on recurring historical trends  seasonal demand and projected customer needs  but the agreements in this segment rarely have minimum volume or spending obligations  and many of the contracts may be terminated by the customers on short notice 
for projects in this segment on which we have commenced work that are cancelled  we may be reimbursed for certain costs  but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues included in our backlog 
federal and state legislative and regulatory developments that we believe should encourage electric power transmission and natural gas pipeline infrastructure spending may fail to result in increased demand for our utility t d services 
in recent years  federal and state legislation has been passed and resulting regulations have been adopted that could significantly increase spending on electric power transmission and natural gas pipeline infrastructure  including the energy act of  the american recovery and reinvestment act of and state renewable portfolio standard rps programs 
however  much fiscal  regulatory and other uncertainty remains as to the impact this legislation and regulation will ultimately have on the demand for our utility t d services 
for instance  regulations implementing provisions of the energy act of that may affect demand for our utility t d services remain  in some cases  subject to review in various federal courts 
accordingly  the effect of these regulations  once finally implemented  is uncertain and may not result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure 
continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the energy act of may result in slower growth in demand for our utility t d services 
renewable energy initiatives  including the recent extension of tax credits for wind and other renewable energy projects that begin construction in  texas competitive renewable energy zone  or crez plan  and other rps initiatives  may not lead to increased demand for our utility t d services 
a majority of states and washington dc have mandatory rps programs that require certain percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources 
however  for budgetary or other reasons  states may reduce those mandates or make them optional or extend deadlines  which could reduce  delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states 
furthermore  renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup 
funding for rps programs may not be available or may be further constrained as a result of the significant declines in government budgets and subsidies and in the availability of credit to finance the significant capital expenditures necessary to build renewable generation capacity 
these factors could lead to fewer projects resulting from rps programs than anticipated or a delay in the timing of these projects and the related infrastructure  which would negatively affect the demand for our utility t d services 
moreover  even if the rps programs are fully developed and funded  we cannot be certain that we will be awarded any resulting contracts 
in addition  infrastructure projects such as those envisioned by crez and rps initiatives are also subject to delays or cancellation due to local factors such as siting disputes  protests and litigation 
before we will receive revenues from infrastructure build outs associated with any of these projects  substantial advance preparations are required such as engineering  procurement  and acquisition and clearance of rights of way  all of which are beyond our control 
investments for renewable energy and electric power infrastructure may not occur  may be less than anticipated or may be delayed  may be concentrated in locations where we do not have significant capabilities  and any resulting contracts may not be awarded to us  any of which could negatively impact demand for our utility t d services 
in addition  the increase in long term demand for natural gas that we believe will benefit from anticipated us greenhouse gas regulations may be delayed or may not occur 
it is difficult to accurately predict the timing and scope of any potential federal or state greenhouse gas regulations that may ultimately be adopted or the extent to which demand for natural gas will increase as a result of any such regulations 

table of contents we have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in prior fiscal years 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis 
as a result  our business  operating results and liquidity could be harmed 
as disclosed in our prior annual reports on form k  we identified material weaknesses in financial reporting as of december  and and for the years through these material weaknesses led to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and  the first three quarters of and the first three quarters of in addition  infrastrux group  llc infrastrux  the company we acquired in july  identified a material weakness in its reporting systems in connection with its fiscal audit 
we believe that all of these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated 
our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis  which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity 
furthermore  because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud  even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements 
our storm restoration revenues are highly volatile and unpredictable  which could result in substantial variations in  and uncertainties regarding  our results of operations generated by our utility t d business 
revenues derived from our storm restoration services are highly volatile and uncertain due to the unpredictable nature of weather related events 
infrastrux s annual storm restoration revenues have been as high as million in when infrastrux experienced the largest storm restoration revenues in its history as several significant hurricanes impacted the gulf coast and florida and ice storms affected the northeast  but storm restoration revenues were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
therefore  infrastrux s storm restoration revenues for are not indicative of the revenues that this business typically generates in any period or can be expected to generate in any future period 
our utility t d segment s revenues and operating income will likely continue to be subject to significant variations and uncertainties due to the volatility of our storm restoration volume 
we may not be able to generate incremental revenues from storm activities to the extent that we do not receive permission from our regular customers including oncor to divert resources from their projects to the restoration work for customers with which we do not have ongoing msa relationships in addition  our storm restoration revenues are offset in part by declines in our transmission and distribution t d services because we staff storm restoration mobilizations by diverting resources from our t d services 
seasonal variations and inclement weather may cause fluctuations in our operating results  profitability  cash flow and working capital needs related to our utility t d segment 
a significant portion of our business in our utility t d segment is performed outdoors 
consequently  our results of operations are exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather 
our utility t d segment performs less work in the winter months  and work is hindered during other inclement weather events 
our utility t d segment revenue and profitability often decrease during the winter months and during severe weather conditions because work performed during these periods is more costly to complete 
during periods of peak electric power demand in the summer  utilities generally are unable to remove their electric power t d equipment from service  decreasing the demand for our maintenance services during such periods 
the seasonality of this segment s business also causes our working capital needs to fluctuate 
because this segment s operating cash flow is usually lower during and immediately following the winter months  we typically experience a need to finance a portion of this segment s working capital during the spring and summer 
we depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in our cable restoration and testing businesses  and we cannot be certain of their confidentiality and protection 
our success in the cable restoration and testing markets depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and services 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary products and services  our cable restoration and testing business may be adversely affected 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on trade secrets and confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees  customers and other third parties 
we also have a license to use the patents dow corning corporation holds from the us patent and trademark office relating to our cablecure product 
in addition  we hold a number of us and international patents  most of which relate to certain materials used in treating cables with cablecure 
we also hold the patent and trademark to cablewise 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately  our competitors may gain access to that technology  and our cable restoration business may be harmed 
any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology  unauthorized persons may be able to copy  reverse engineer or otherwise use some of our proprietary technology 
furthermore  existing laws may afford only limited protection  and the laws of certain countries in which we 
table of contents operate do not protect proprietary technology as well as established law in the united states 
for these reasons  we may have difficulty protecting our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use or maintaining our market share with respect to our proprietary technology offerings 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
this type of litigation is often costly and time consuming  with no assurance of success 
our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us 
we occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price 
these types of claims occur due to matters such as owner caused delays or changes from the initial project scope  which result in additional costs  both direct and indirect 
these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings  and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved 
when these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending  we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims 
a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
our business is dependent on a limited number of key clients 
we operate primarily in the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power industries  providing services to a limited number of clients 
much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients 
the loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
one client was responsible for approximately percent of total contract revenue in this client was also responsible for percent of our month backlog and percent of our total backlog at december  our use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our revenues is currently generated by fixed price contracts 
under a fixed price contract  we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project  based upon a defined scope  which includes specific assumptions and project criteria 
if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur  our margins will decrease  and we may incur a loss 
the revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks  we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year 
in general  turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations 
this is a result of the long term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts  whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract 
in addition  our utility t d segment also generates substantial revenue under unit price contracts under which we have agreed to perform identified units of work for an agreed price  which have similar associated risks as those identified above for fixed price contracts 
a unit can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation 
the resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit 
failure to accurately estimate the costs of completing a particular project could result in reduced profits or losses 
percentage of completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in material adjustments that would adversely affect our operating results 
we recognize contract revenue using the percentage of completion method on long term fixed price contracts 
under this method  estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined 
accordingly  contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved  and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised 
these estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience  and are only estimates 
variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material 
to the extent that these adjustments result in an increase  a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue  we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings  which could be material 

table of contents terrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations  our ability to raise capital or secure insurance  or our future growth 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations 
in addition  future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating both outside and inside the united states 
further  the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments may subject our operations to increased risks and  depending on their ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to a number of operational risks 
our business operations include pipeline construction  fabrication  pipeline rehabilitation services and construction and turnaround and maintenance services to refiners and petrochemical facilities 
we also provide a wide range of services in electric power and natural gas transmission and distribution 
these operations involve a high degree of operational risk 
natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  equipment and the environment  and suspension of operations 
in locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others  our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage  loss of revenue  casualty loss  increased costs and significant liability to third parties 
the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
unsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties  can affect customer relationships  result in higher operating costs  negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover 
workplace safety is important to us  our employees  and our customers 
as a result  we maintain comprehensive safety programs and training to all applicable employees throughout our organization 
while we focus on protecting people and property  our work is performed at construction sites and in industrial facilities and our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing these services 
even with proper safety precautions  these hazards can lead to personal injury  loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  plant and equipment  and environmental damage 
we are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level 
although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to adequately train and equip our employees  we have experienced serious accidents  including fatalities  in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future 
serious accidents may subject us to penalties  civil litigation or criminal prosecution 
claims for damages to persons  including claims for bodily injury or loss of life  could result in costs and liabilities  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors 
some of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties 
in addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work  where work is performed through a joint venture  we also have potential liability for the work performed by the joint venture itself 
in these projects  even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget  we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of the joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications 
we act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake 
in our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor  we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only certain specialized activities such as hazardous waste removal  nondestructive inspection and catering and security 
however  with respect to epc and other contracts  including those in our utility t d segment  we may choose to subcontract a portion or substantial portion of the project 
in the construction industry  the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  when acting as a prime contractor  we are subject to the risks associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 

table of contents we are self insured against many potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation and employee group health claims  many of those policies are subject to substantial deductibles  and we are self insured up to the amount of the deductible 
since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies  we are effectively self insured for the overwhelming majority of claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and noncurrent liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
if our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities  we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity 
our operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities 
our us and canadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent 
we regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas  such as rivers  lakes and wetlands 
part of the business in our utility t d segment is done in the southwestern us where there is a greater risk of fines  work stoppages or other sanctions for disturbing native american artifacts and archeological sites 
significant fines  penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations  and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances  rendering a person liable for environmental damage  without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
in addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others  or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed 
we own and operate several properties in the united states and canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released 
any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  the resource compensation and recovery act rcra  and or analogous state  provincial or local laws 
cercla imposes joint and several liabilities  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment  while rcra governs the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
under these or similar laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property 
this could have a significant impact on our future results 
our operations outside of the us and canada are often times potentially subject to similar governmental or provincial controls and restrictions relating to the environment 
we are unable to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
as a result  there have been a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced and or issued in the united states as well as other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
although it is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation or regulations  including those introduced or adopted in the future  would impact our business and operations  it is possible that such laws and regulations could result in greater compliance costs  capital spending requirements or operating restrictions for us and or our customers and could adversely affect the demand for some of our services 

table of contents our industry is highly competitive  which could impede our growth 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
a substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals 
we compete for these projects against government owned or supported companies and other companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
in some markets  there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price 
our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies 
our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures  greater resources or other advantages and  therefore  may be able to provide their services at lower rates than ours or elect to place bids on projects that drive down margins to lower levels than we would accept 
in recent years our cable restoration business in our utility t d segment has begun to face increasing competition from alternative technologies 
our cablecure product sales may be adversely affected by technological improvements made by one or more of our competitors and or the expiration of our exclusive intellectual property rights in such technology 
if we are unable to keep pace with current or future technological advances in cable restoration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we are dependent upon the services of our executive management 
our success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management 
our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships 
our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients  stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management team 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals 
the loss or interruption of services provided by one or more of our senior officers could adversely affect our results of operations 
we contribute to multi employer plans that could result in liabilities to us if those plans are terminated or we withdraw from those plans 
we contribute to several multi employer pension plans for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 
these plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts 
the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the multi employer pension plan amendments act of  imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multi employer plan in the event of the employer s withdrawal from  or upon termination of  such plan 
in addition  if the funding of any of these multi employer plans becomes in critical status under the pension protection act of  we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans 
a number of plans to which our business units contribute or may contribute in the future are in endangered or critical status 
certain of these plans may require additional contributions  generally in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans 
the amount of additional funds  if any  that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated  as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans 
governmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
many aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate  including those relating to currency conversion and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and earnings of our personnel  the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers  including  in some jurisdictions  mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets 
in addition  we depend on the demand for our services from the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power industries  and  therefore  our business is affected by changing taxes  price controls and laws and regulations relating to these industries generally 
the adoption of laws and regulations by the countries or the states in which we operate that are intended to curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and gas or the development of electric power generation facilities for economic and other policy reasons  could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services 
our operations are also subject to the risk of changes in laws and policies which may impose restrictions on our business  including trade restrictions  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
other types of governmental regulation which could  if enacted or implemented  adversely affect our operations include 
table of contents expropriation or nationalization decrees  confiscatory tax systems  primary or secondary boycotts directed at specific countries or companies  embargoes  extensive import restrictions or other trade barriers  mandatory sourcing and local participation rules  stringent local registration or ownership requirements  oil  gas or electric power price regulation  unrealistically high labor rate and fuel price regulation  and registration and licensing requirements 
our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in  or new interpretations of  existing regulations  and the impact of these changes could be material 
special risks associated with doing business in highly corrupt environments may adversely affect our business 
our international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent 
since the anti bribery restrictions of the fcpa make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage  we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence 
risks related to our common stock our common stock  which is listed on the new york stock exchange  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are likely to continue in the future  and you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid by you 
the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control  including the following the risk factors described in this item a  a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industries generally  general conditions in our customers industries  and general conditions in the securities markets 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover  which may adversely affect the performance of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  which may adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 
for example  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  which allows only one third of our directors to be elected each year  deny stockholders the ability to take action by written consent  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders  provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors  chairman  chief executive officer or president  and authorize our board of directors to designate the terms of and to approve the issuance of new series of preferred stock 

table of contents future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise  either by us  a member of management or a major stockholder  or the perception that these sales could occur  may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
in the event we issue stock as consideration for acquisitions or to fund our corporate activities  we may dilute share ownership 
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
if we do issue additional equity securities  such issuances may have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in our company 
our future sale of common stock  preferred stock  warrants or convertible securities may lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding stock 
our authorized shares of common stock consist of million shares 
the issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would result in further dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing stockholders 
we are authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  one million shares of preferred stock  which may give other stockholders dividend  conversion  voting and liquidation rights  among other rights  which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
while our board of directors has no present intention of authorizing the issuance of any such preferred stock  it reserves the right to do so in the future

overview willbros is a provider of engineering and construction services to the oil  gas  refinery  petrochemical and power industries with a focus on infrastructure such as oil and gas pipeline systems  electric t d systems and refining and processing plants 
our offerings include engineering  procurement and construction either individually or as an integrated epc service offering  turnarounds  maintenance and other specialty services 
year in review contract revenue increased  to  from  in as a result of growth in all three segments 
revenue generated by our oil and gas segment increased over percent driven by growth in our regional offices  increased cross country pipeline and facilities construction  strong demand for our professional services including engineering and integrity  as well as an uptick in construction and maintenance work in the downstream market 
our canada segment also increased revenue by over percent and is on track to achieve the  annual revenue run rate that we projected 
our utility t d segment achieved revenue growth of nearly percent due to increased transmission construction activity in texas and growth in our mid atlantic offices 
operating income increased  to  in compared to a loss of  in the variance is largely explained by goodwill impairment charges of  which were partially offset by a  reduction of our contingent earnout liability associated with the infrastrux acquisition 
we believe we made significant progress on our objective to turn around our strategic but non performing businesses 
many of these businesses showed marked improvement by performing as planned  or better than expected  including our engineering  epc and integrity businesses  as well as  our field services work in canada 
however  we were not successful in achieving our improvement initiatives for our electric and gas distribution business in the northeast 
due to this lack of improvement  management has decided to sell the business in while operating income improved during the year  our results for continuing operations were negatively impacted by significant losses we incurred on two projects including the red river pipeline project in texas and the woodlands project in canada 
in the aggregate  these two projects reduced our operating income by approximately  we are no longer accepting the same types of contractual risks that we assumed on the red river pipeline project and we will not bid for  nor do we have  lump sum facilities projects in our canadian backlog 
to sum up  in  we made significant progress on turning around most of our strategic but non performing businesses and we continued to advance our strategy to bring more recurring services into our revenue base 
positive highlights for include we made significant progress turning around the profitability of our downstream engineering business in the oil gas segment and our texas distribution business in our utility t d segment 

table of contents on march   we entered into a settlement agreement with wapco to settle the west african gas pipeline wagp project litigation 
this settlement stops the significant legal spend on the litigation  including any additional expense for trial and likely appeal  creates certainty of the outcome and eliminates trial risk 
we believe this is a fair settlement and are pleased to remove the overhang of this litigation 
we collaborated with geoeye  inc  a leading source of geospatial information and insight  to develop a cloud based pipeline integrity management solution 
this cloud based solution will provide customers easy access to real time pipeline information integrated with geoeye s high resolution  map accurate commercial satellite imagery served from the google earth builder platform 
on january   we signed a definitive share purchase agreement and completed the sale of all of our shares of capital in willbros middle east limited  which owned our subsidiary in oman  to interserve holdings limited  a subsidiary of interserve plc 
we remain focused on analyzing the performance of all our businesses relative to our peers and strategic objectives 
we will continue to take management actions to improve operating performance in all of our businesses 
looking forward last year  our objective was to take actions to turn around our strategic but non performing businesses 
we saw improvements in most of our businesses and several performed as planned  or better than expected  including our engineering  epc and integrity services  our electric distribution services in texas and our field services work in canada 
however  we also had businesses that did not perform to our expectations and we are taking actions to remediate or dispose of these underperforming business units 
our electric and gas distribution business in the northeast  continued to hamper our results  therefore  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to sell the business in we remain focused on analyzing the performance of all our business units relative to our peers and strategic objectives 
we will continue to take management actions to improve our performance or exit the businesses which do not meet our criteria 
we are positioned to address significant growth markets in north america and last year  we increased our revenue by nearly percent 
our primary objective in is to maintain focus on generating improved operating results  cash flow and margins 
we intend to do this through hiring more management talent  continued strengthening of our project management capabilities  bolstering our training programs  and adding work to backlog with more favorable terms and conditions 
at the same time  we continue to evaluate industry conditions and develop strategies that leverage our competitive advantages in the markets we pursue 
we intend to remain focused on actions underway throughout  namely  reducing debt  cultural acceptance of safety as an undeniable value and sharp focus on the end markets we serve in north america the canadian oil sands  the development of liquids rich hydrocarbon sources  the expansion of the electric transmission grid  and the emerging integrity market 
we will continue to advance our strategy of increasing revenue from recurring services to mitigate the seasonality of our business 
we will continue to analyze the performance of our business units relative to our peers and take actions to improve operating margins or exit the businesses which do not meet our objectives 
we expect these actions to drive incremental improvement in all our businesses and markets in other financial measures backlog in our industry  backlog is considered an indicator of potential future performance as it represents a portion of the future revenue stream 
our strategy is focused on capturing quality backlog with margins commensurate with the risks associated with a given project  and for the past several years we have put processes and procedures in place to identify contractual and execution risks in new work opportunities and believe we have instilled in the organization the discipline to price  accept and book only work which meets stringent criteria for commercial success and profitability 
we believe the backlog figures are firm  subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts 
additionally  due to the short duration of many jobs  revenue associated with jobs won and performed within a reporting period will not be reflected in quarterly backlog reports 
we generate revenue from numerous sources  including contracts of long or short duration entered into during a year as well as from various contractual processes  including change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work 
these revenue sources are not added to backlog until realization is assured 

table of contents backlog broadly consists of anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured 
our backlog presentation reflects not only the month lump sum and msa work  but also  the full term value of work under contract  including msa work as we believe that this information is helpful in providing additional long term visibility 
we determine the amount of backlog for work under ongoing msa maintenance and construction contracts by using recurring historical trends inherent in the msas  factoring in seasonal demand and projecting customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the customer 
we also include in backlog our share of work to be performed under contracts signed by joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
at december   month backlog from continuing operations increased  driven largely through escalated work activity in all three segments 
total backlog increased  and continues to include recurring services on msa contracts extending through july backlog for discontinued operations consisted primary of work associated with our electric and gas distribution business in the northeast and was  at december  and  at december  the following tables show our backlog from continuing operations by operating segment and geographic location as of december  and and our month year end backlog for each of the last five years as of december  month percent total percent month percent total percent oil gas utility t d canada total backlog as of december  total percent total percent total backlog by geographic region united states canada middle east other international backlog on january   we sold all of the shares of capital in willbros middle east limited  a company organized under the laws of the cayman islands  which owned our subsidiary in oman 
as such  the company will no longer have backlog in the middle east subsequent to december  as of december  month backlog adjusted ebitda from continuing operations we define adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as income loss from continuing operations before interest expense  income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization  adjusted for items broadly consisting of selected items which management does not consider representative of our ongoing operations and certain non cash items of the company 
these adjustments are included in various performance metrics under our credit facilities and other financing arrangements 
these adjustments are itemized in the following table 
you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda from continuing operations  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as  or similar to  some of the adjustments in this presentation 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 

table of contents management uses adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as a supplemental performance measure for comparing normalized operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry  and presentations made to analysts  investment banks and other members of the financial community who use this information in order to make investment decisions about us 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is not a financial measurement recognized under us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use adjusted ebitda from continuing operations in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income  operating income  or any other performance measure derived in accordance with us gaap  or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
because all companies do not use identical calculations  our presentation of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations increased  to  for year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to a reduction of general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue coupled with increased contract revenue with consistent contract margin year over year

liquidity and capital resources our financing objective is to maintain financial flexibility to meet the material  equipment and personnel needs to support our project and msa commitments 
our primary source of capital is our cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additional sources and uses of capital pursuant to our amendment and restatement agreement dated as of november   the credit agreement was amended and restated in its entirety the amended and restated credit agreement 
under the amended and restated credit agreement  certain existing lenders under the revolving credit facility holding an aggregate amount of commitments equal to  agreed that the maturity applicable to such commitments would be extended by one year  to june  the amended and restated credit agreement provides for additional term loans in an amount equal to  which will be pari passu in right of payment with  and secured on a pari passu basis with our existing term loan outstanding under the credit agreement 
the additional term loans were drawn in full on the effective date of the amended and restated credit agreement 
the additional term loans were issued at a discount such that the funded portion was equal to percent of the principal amount of additional term loans 
the additional term loans will mature on june   the same maturity date as our existing term loan under the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  the revolving credit facility was available for letters of credit and for revolving loans  which could be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
percent of the revolving credit facility could be used to obtain letters of credit  and revolving loans had a sublimit of 
table of contents  on march   as part of an amendment to the credit agreement  we agreed to limit our revolver borrowings to  with the exception of proceeds from revolving borrowings used to make any payments in respect of both the convertible senior notes the notes and the senior convertible notes the notes  until our maximum total leverage ratio is to or less 
as such  subsequent to this amendment  on march   we borrowed  under the revolving credit facility to fund the repayment of the notes and borrowed an additional  under the revolving credit facility on july  the amended and restated credit agreement effectively modifies the sublimit described above by including a sublimit for any new borrowings under the revolving credit facility after the effective date of the amended and restated credit agreement 
this sublimit for new borrowings will range from to  as determined by reference to a formula  which will permit new revolver borrowings only if we first make voluntary prepayments and or mandatory repayments or prepayments of revolver borrowings from the net proceeds of asset sales  equity issuances or other sources 
the new sublimit will not apply to new borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which are used to make payments of amounts due or outstanding in respect of the notes 
however  if on or after march   we have received net proceeds from asset sales or equity issuances equal to or exceeding  the sublimit for borrowings will be  with an increase to  after the close of any fiscal quarter in which our maximum total leverage ratio is to or less  in each case  including any borrowings under the revolving credit facility used to make payments of amounts due or outstanding in respect of the notes 
as such  in consideration of these modifications  on november   we repaid  of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and borrowed  under the revolving credit facility to fund the repayment of the notes on december  as of december   we had  in outstanding revolver borrowings and  in letters of credit outstanding  with  remaining against our  capacity 
subsequent to december   we repaid  of our outstanding borrowings through proceeds received from the sale of willbros middle east limited  which held our operations in oman 
we believe that additional sales of non strategic assets and cash flow from operations will allow us to operate under the reduced commitment amount of  for the revolving credit facility subsequent to june  we continue to take steps to generate positive operating cash flow and will continue to pursue opportunities to reduce our financial leverage and strengthen our overall balance sheet 
these steps may include additional sales of non strategic and under performing assets including equipment  real property and businesses as well as accessing capital markets to reduce or refinance our indebtedness

limitations on indebtedness 
limitations on liens 
limitations on certain asset sales and dispositions 
limitations on certain acquisitions and asset purchases if certain liquidity levels are not maintained 
a default under the amended and restated credit agreement may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with financial covenants or other covenants or a failure to make payments when due under the amended and restated agreement  a failure to make payments when due in respect of  or a failure to perform obligations relating to  other debt obligations in excess of  a change of control of the company  and certain insolvency proceedings

as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended and restated credit agreement 
on november   following receipt of the required consents  we entered into a fifth supplemental indenture the fifth supplemental indenture to the indenture for the notes 
the fifth supplemental indenture further amended section of the indenture so that certain restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness were not applicable to our borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement during the period from and including the effective date of the fifth supplemental indenture through and including december  the notes matured on december  and we repaid the notes in full  which consisted of a cash payment of  to the holders of the notes  which included  of accrued interest and the  outstanding principal balance

interest rate risk interest rate swaps we are subject to hedging arrangements to fix or otherwise limit the interest cost of our existing term loan and revolving credit facility 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment of cash and cash equivalents arising in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading strategies 
we currently have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of  in order to hedge changes in our variable rate interest expense on  of our existing term loan and revolving credit facility libor indexed debt 
under each swap agreement  we receive interest at a rate based on the maximum of either three month libor or and pay interest at a fixed rate of through june  the swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments  with the effective portion of the swaps change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income oci 
the interest rate swaps are deemed to be highly effective hedges  and resulted in an immaterial amount recorded for hedge ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations 
amounts in oci are reported in interest expense when the hedged interest payments on the underlying debt are recognized 
the fair value of each swap agreement was determined using a model with level inputs including quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates 
amounts of oci relating to the interest rate swaps expected to be recognized in interest expense in the coming months total interest rate caps in september  we entered into two interest rate cap agreements for notional amounts of  each in order to limit our exposure to an increase of the interest rate above percent  effective september  through march  total premiums of were paid for the interest rate cap agreements

through june   the interest rate caps were deemed to be highly effective  resulting in an immaterial amount of hedge ineffectiveness recorded 
on june   the caps were de designated due to the interest rate being fixed on the underlying debt through the remaining term of the caps  changes in the value of the caps subsequent to that date were reported in earnings

these payments resulted in the recognition of a  loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  these losses represent the write off of unamortized oid and financing costs inclusive of early payment fees 
such loss is recorded in the line item loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  on december   we made a cash payment of  to the holders of the notes  which included  of unpaid interest

as of december   there were  in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and there were  in outstanding letters of credit 
all outstanding letters of credit relate to continuing operations 
at december   we had uncertain tax positions totaling  which ultimately could result in a tax payment 
as the amount of the ultimate tax payment is contingent on the tax authorities assessments  it is not practical to present annual payment information 
we have unsecured credit facilities with banks in certain countries outside the united states 
borrowings in the form of short term notes and overdrafts are made at competitive local interest rates 
generally  each line is available only for borrowings related to operations in a specific country 
credit available under these facilities is approximately  at december  there were no outstanding borrowings made under these facilities at december  or off balance sheet arrangements and commercial commitments from time to time  we enter into commercial commitments  usually in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit  surety bonds and financial guarantees 
contracts with our customers may require us to provide letters of credit or surety bonds with regard to our performance of contracted services 
in such cases  the commitments can be called upon in the event of our failure to perform contracted services 
likewise  contracts may allow us to issue letters of credit or surety bonds in lieu of contract retention provisions  in which the client withholds a percentage of the contract value until project completion or expiration of a warranty period 
the letters of credit represent the maximum amount of payments we could be required to make if these letters of credit are drawn upon 
additionally  we issue surety bonds customarily required by commercial terms on construction projects 
us surety bonds represent the bond penalty amount of future payments we could be required to make if we fail to perform our obligations under such contracts 
the surety bonds do not have a stated expiration date  rather  each is released when the contract is accepted by the owner 
our maximum exposure as it relates to the value of the bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced 
as of december   no liability has been recognized for letters of credit or surety bonds 

table of contents a summary of our off balance sheet commercial commitments for both continuing and discontinued operations as of december  is as follows expiration per period total commitment less than year years more than years letters of credit us performance canada performance total letters of credit us surety bonds primarily performance total commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates revenue a number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue 
we typically structure contracts as unit price  time and materials  fixed price or cost plus fixed fee 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work  cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized 
revenue from unit price and time and materials contracts is recognized as earned 
revenue for fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
certain fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts include  or are amended to include  incentive bonus amounts  contingent on accomplishing a stated milestone 
revenue attributable to incentive bonus amounts is recognized when the risk and uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the milestone have been removed 
we do not recognize income on a fixed price contract until the contract is approximately five to ten percent complete  depending upon the nature of the contract 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved changed orders when realization of price approval is probable and the amount is estimable 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on the balance sheet 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is subject to adjustment in subsequent periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreements with customers 
we consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
valuation of goodwill we record as goodwill the amount by which the total purchase price we pay in our acquisition transactions exceeds our estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired 
our goodwill impairment assessment includes a two step fair value based test and is performed annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances exist which indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
we determined that our segments represent our reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments 

table of contents the first step of the two step fair value based test involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a corresponding charge to operating expense 
we perform the required annual impairment test for goodwill by determining the fair values of our reporting units using a weighted combination of the following generally accepted valuation approaches income approach discounted cash flows of future benefit streams  market approach public comparable company multiples of ebitda  and market approach multiples generated from recent transactions comparable in size  nature and industry 
these approaches include numerous assumptions with respect to future circumstances  such as industry and or local market conditions that might directly impact operations in the future  and are  therefore  uncertain 
these approaches are utilized to develop a range of fair values and a weighted average of these approaches are utilized to determine the best fair value estimate within that range 
income approach discounted cash flows 
this valuation approach derives a present value of the reporting unit s projected future annual cash flows over the next eight years and the present residual value of the reporting unit 
we used a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows  including assumptions relating to future economic market conditions  sales volumes  costs and expenses and capital expenditures 
these assumptions are dependent on regional market conditions  including competitive position  degree of vertical integration  supply and demand for materials and other industry conditions 
the discount rate used in our analysis for  specifically the weighted average cost of capital  was approximately percent 
the revenue compounded annual growth rates used in our analysis for varied from percent to percent 
our ebitda margins derived from these underlying assumptions for the analysis varied between approximately percent and percent 
the terminal growth rate used for our analysis was percent 
market approach multiples of ebitda 
this valuation approach utilizes publicly traded construction companies enterprise values  as compared to their recent ebitda information 
for the analysis  we used an average ebitda multiple of times in determining this market approach metric 
this multiple is used as a valuation metric to our most recent financial performance 
we used ebitda as an indicator of demand because it is a widely used key indicator of the cash generating capacity of similar companies 
market approach comparisons of recent transactions 
this valuation approach uses publicly available information regarding recent third party sales transactions in our industry to derive a valuation metric of the target s respective enterprise values over their ebitda amounts 
for our analysis  we did not weight this market approach because current economic conditions did not yield significant recent transactions to derive an appropriate valuation metric 
we selected these valuation approaches because we believe the combination of these approaches  along with our best judgment regarding underlying assumptions and estimates  provides us with the best estimate of fair value 
we believe these valuation approaches are proven and appropriate for the industry and widely accepted by investors 
the estimated fair value would change if our weighting assumptions under these valuation approaches were materially modified 
for our analysis  we weighted the income approach discounted cash flows at percent and the market approach multiples of ebitda at percent 
this weighting was utilized to reflect fair value in current market conditions 
our valuation model utilizes assumptions  which represent our best estimate of future events  but would be sensitive to positive or negative changes in each of the underlying assumptions as well as an alternative weighting of valuation methods  which would result in a potentially higher or lower goodwill impairment charge

the operating performance and future outlook for our electric and gas distribution business in the northeast continued to decline  which ultimately resulted in our decision to sell the business and discontinue its operations 
further  the challenging competitive landscape contributed to the full write off of goodwill attributed to this segment 
in  we recorded impairment charges of   and  respectively  in our utility t d  oil gas and canada segments 
the slow economic recovery  exacerbated by the instability in world financial markets and the hard hit us housing sector  resulted in a reassessment of future growth rates and a reduction in the outlook for future cash flows in the utility t d segment 
the impairment charge for our oil gas and canada segments represented a full write off of goodwill and was a result of a depressed fair market valuation 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to our oil gas segment 
the impairment charge was a result of reduced demand for services within this segment which stemmed from a combination of lower levels of capital and maintenance spending in the refining industry and significantly decreased margins within a highly competitive environment 
valuation of other intangible assets our intangible assets with finite lives include customer relationships  trade names  non compete agreements and developed technology 
the value of customer relationships is estimated using the income approach  specifically the excess earnings method 
the excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships  with consideration given to customer contract renewals  the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to our business plan  income taxes and required rates of return 
the value of trade names is estimated using the relief from royalty method of the income approach 
this approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership  a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset 
we amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a straight line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for instance  a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer  among other things  may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of intangible assets 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary 
this evaluation  as well as an evaluation of our other intangible assets  requires us to make long term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment  and our projections may vary from the 
table of contents cash flows eventually realized 
future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
the effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value less selling costs of such asset and its carrying value 
such expense would be reflected in earnings 
insurance we are insured for workers compensation  employer s liability  auto liability and general liability claims  subject to a deductible of per occurrence 
additionally  our largest non union employee related health care benefit plan is subject to a deductible of per claimant per year 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  with assistance from third party actuaries 
for these claims  to the extent we have insurance coverage above the deductible amounts  we have recorded a receivable reflected in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported 
the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends 
income taxes the financial accounting standards board s standard for income taxes takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets in determination of our valuation allowance and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
the provision or benefit for income taxes and the annual effective tax rate are impacted by income taxes in certain countries being computed based on a deemed profit rather than on taxable income and tax holidays on certain international projects 
we record reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain tax positions assuming that the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
the income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in our future consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
effects of inflation and changing prices our operations are affected by increases in prices  whether caused by inflation  government mandates or other economic factors  in the countries in which we operate 
we attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor  equipment  fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk is our exposure to changes in non us primarily canada currency exchange rates 
we attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in us dollars  but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency 
to mitigate non us currency exchange risk  we seek to match anticipated non us currency revenue with expense in the same currency whenever possible 
to the extent we are unable to match non us currency revenue with expense in the same currency  we may use forward contracts  options or other common hedging techniques in the same non us currencies 
we had no forward contracts or options at december  and 
table of contents the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at december  due to the generally short maturities of these items 
at december   we invested primarily in short term dollar denominated bank deposits 
we have the ability and expect to hold our investments to maturity 
under the amended and restated credit agreement  we are subject to hedging arrangements to fix or otherwise limit the interest cost of our existing term loan and the revolving credit facility 
we currently have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of  in order to hedge changes in our variable rate interest expense on  of our existing term loan and revolving credit facility libor indexed debt 
under each swap agreement  we receive interest at a rate based on the maximum of either three month libor or and pay interest at a fixed rate of through june  each swap agreement is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedging instrument and is deemed a highly effective hedge 
the fair value of the swap agreements was  at december  and was based on using a model with level inputs including quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase the fair value of the swaps by conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates subject to minimum rates of zero would decrease the fair value of the swaps by we also entered in to two interest rate cap agreements for notional amounts of  each in order to limit exposure to an increase of the interest rate above percent  effective september  through march  through june   the cap agreements were designated and qualified as cash flow hedging instruments and were deemed to be highly effective hedges 
on june   the caps were de designated due to the interest rate being fixed on the underlying debt through the remaining term of the caps  changes in the value of the caps subsequent to that date were reported in earnings 
the amount reported in earnings for the undesignated interest rate caps for the years ended december  and is immaterial 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements was at december
