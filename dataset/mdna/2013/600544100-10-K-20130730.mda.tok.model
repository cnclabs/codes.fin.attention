the company manufactures products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller performance system hmps 
herman miller strives to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
accordingly  production is order driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
these factors result in a high rate of inventory turns and typically cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low compared to sales volume 
a key element of the company manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed the company to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
the business is comprised of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
these operating segments are determined on the basis of how the company internally reports and evaluates financial information used to make operating decisions 
for external reporting purposes  the company has identified the following reportable segments north american furniture solutions includes the operations associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products for work related settings  including office  education  and healthcare environments  throughout the united states and canada 
the north american furniture solutions reportable segment is the aggregation of two operating segments

within the industries the company operates  herman miller  nemschoff  geiger and maharam are acknowledged as leading brands that inspire architects and designers to create their best design solutions 
leveraging the company brand equity across the lines of business to extend the company reach to customers and consumers is an important element of the company business strategy 
problem solving design and innovation the company is committed to developing research based functionality and aesthetically innovative new products and has a history of doing so 
the company believes its skills and experience in matching problem solving design with the workplace needs of customers provides the company with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of the company business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
the company accomplishes this through the use of an internal research and engineering staff as well as third party design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis 
operational excellence the company was among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing 
hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations 
the company is committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency 
the company has extended this lean process work to its non manufacturing processes as well as externally to our manufacturing supply chain and distribution channel 
the company believes these concepts hold great promise for further gains in reliability  quality and efficiency 
building and leading networks the company values relationships in all areas of the business 
the company considers its network of innovative designers  owned and independent dealers  and suppliers to be among the most important competitive factors and vital to the long term success of the business 
channels of distribution the company products and services are offered to most of its customers under standard trade credit terms between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of the company product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world 
these dealers purchase the company products and distribute them to end customers 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales through this channel once products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services  including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers at june   the company owned contract furniture dealerships  some of which have operations in multiple locations 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
the company recognizes revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete 
the company believes independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is generally the best model for a financially strong distribution network 
with this in mind  the company strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition the remaining owned dealerships to independent owners 
where possible  the goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions 
direct customer sales the company also sells products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary eg sales to the us federal government 
in most of these instances  the company contracts separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
the company recognizes revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
e commerce the company sells products through its online store  in which products are available for sale via the company website  hermanmiller

in pursuing our mission  we are shifting our business model to focus on increasing the size of our addressable market  faster growing segments driven by demographics  and higher margin products 
this shift relies on the following key avenues of growth

specialty consumer we will utilize this segment to further diversify our sales channel  increase brand recognition for all markets  and improve our access to key product specifiers 
industry analysis the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
the company monitors the trade statistics reported by bifma and considers them an indicator of industry wide sales and order performance 
bifma publishes statistical data for the contract segment and the office supply segment within the us furniture market 
the us contract segment relates primarily to large to mid size corporations installed via a network of dealers 
the office supply segment relates primarily to smaller customers via wholesalers and retailers 
the company primarily participates  and is a leader in  the contract segment 
it is important to note that the company diversification strategy lessens our dependence on the us office furniture market 
the company also analyzes bifma statistical information as a benchmark comparison against the performance of the domestic us business and also to that of competitors 
the timing of large project based business may affect comparisons to this data in any one period 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which the company uses internally as one of several considerations in its short and long range planning process 
looking forward  the general economic outlook for our industry in the us is expected to be positive 
bifma issued its most recent report in may expecting that the growth rate of office furniture orders in the us will be percent and percent in calendar and  respectively  while the forecasted growth rate of shipments was percent and percent for calendar and  respectively 
this forecasted growth is based on an improvement in the us economy  primarily driven by an improvement in employment 
discussion of business conditions the fiscal years ended june  and june  contained and weeks of operations  respectively 
the extra week in fiscal was included in the first quarter 
the extra week in the prior year is required approximately every six years in order to re align our fiscal reporting dates with the actual calendar months 
this is a factor that should be considered when comparing our financial results to the prior year period 
net sales in fiscal totaled  million  an increase of percent over the level we reported in fiscal this marked our third consecutive year of growth  over which time our net sales have increased by more than million 
importantly  the sales growth we achieved this past year was accompanied by strong profitability and cash generation 
we balanced our focus on forward strategic investment with our responsibility to deliver solid current period returns 
in doing so  we achieved an operating earnings percentage and earnings per share equal to percent and  respectively percent and on an adjusted non gaap basis and an after tax return on invested capital of approximately percent 
cash flows generated from operations totaled million  up percent from last year level 
this improved cash flow from operations allowed us to increase strategic spending across a number of important areas including new products  acquisitions  infrastructure improvements  and brand building 
throughout the fiscal year  our north american furniture solutions segment faced the headwind of sluggish demand from us federal government and healthcare buyers 
with that said  robust business activity across the remainder of our core non government office furniture business helped drive growth for the segment as a whole relative to fiscal our non north america furniture solutions segment also experienced a mixed demand picture  with lagging sales in the united kingdom uk and other european economies being more than offset by increases in china and the middle east 
we are improving our existing production capabilities and preparing for new growth in emerging markets 
the integration of posh manufacturing in china continues and we will begin the construction of a new facility next spring to consolidate our uk operations serving emea europe  middle east and africa 
we also have plans in development for india and latin america that hold further promise for growth in those markets 
our specialty and consumer segment posted solid sales growth this fiscal year  driven by the investments we ve made in developing our offering across both commercial and retail markets 
the herman miller collection continues to grow in reach and quality  with multiple newly reissued iconic designs and including innovative new material options 
in the last year we have also introduced wholly new designs  through both our herman miller and geiger brands 
our italian alliances with magis and mattiazzi are another source for new products and enhance our brand with consumers and specifiers 
we have been developing our channels to market  with new shop in shop merchandising initiatives in the retail channel  as well as continued investment in our online marketing and fulfillment capabilities 
in april  we reached a major milestone with our acquisition of maharam fabric corporation  a premier design brand in commercial interiors and recognized internationally for the highest quality textiles and wall coverings 
the addition of maharam to our specialty and consumer segment is a powerful strategic accelerator for our entire business  on multiple levels 
we instantly became a north american market leader in their core product areas  with the ability to leverage our resources to further maharam reach into new markets 
we have made it clear that maharam will continue to be maharam  maintaining their identity  design and operational excellence that made them a successful business  but we are also excited by the mutual brand reinforcement we gain in bringing the companies together 
we made significant progress this year toward our commitment to further strengthen our balance sheet while returning greater cash to shareholders 
this includes the actions we ve taken to terminate our us defined benefit pension plans in favor of a defined contribution retirement program 
we believe this plan to terminate our us defined benefit pension plans will improve the predictability of cash flows and expenses associated with our employee benefit programs and significantly reduce balance sheet risk 
we expect the process to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal at the time of termination  we will be required to make additional cash contributions to the plans  which we currently estimate will total between million and million 
our results for the year ended june  include expenses associated with the transition from and planned termination of the domestic defined benefit pension plans 
these expenses  referred to as  legacy pension expenses throughout this document  include settlements caused by the transition and net periodic benefit expenses  subsequent to september   related to the defined benefit plans in question 
they also include incremental pension expenses in the first quarter of fiscal resulting from modifications we made to the investment strategy of our defined benefit plan assets in order to prepare for the termination process 
we recognized legacy pension expenses totaling million for the year ended june  of this amount  million is recorded within operating expenses and the remaining portion is included in cost of sales  thus reducing gross margin by approximately basis points 
non gaap measurements  see accompanying reconciliations and explanations 
concurrent with the progress we made on the termination of our us defined benefit pension plans and transition to a defined contribution retirement program  we also implemented two dividend increases  raising our annualized payout from million in fiscal  to today run rate of approximately million 
capital expenditures totaled million for the year ended june   an increase of million compared to fiscal the ramp up in capital spending was in support of our shift strategy which includes investments in new product development  customer showroom refreshes  and other facilities 
we expect capital expenditures to increase to million in fiscal in continued support of our avenues of growth 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures this report contains adjusted operating earnings measures and adjusted earnings per share diluted that are non gaap financial measures 
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted earnings per share diluted are calculated by excluding from operating earnings and earnings per share diluted items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance 
such items consist of expenses associated with restructuring actions taken to adjust our cost structure to the current business climate and transition related expenses  including amortization and settlement expenses  relating to defined benefit pension plans that we intend to terminate 
we present adjusted operating earnings and adjusted earnings per share diluted because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe them to be useful in analyzing ongoing results from operations 
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted earnings per share diluted are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered an alternative to operating earnings and earnings per share diluted under gaap 
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted earnings per share diluted have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
in addition  in evaluating adjusted operating earnings and adjusted earnings per share diluted  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation 
our presentation of adjusted operating earnings and adjusted earnings per share diluted should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items 
we compensate for these limitations by providing equal prominence of our gaap results and using adjusted operating earnings and adjusted earnings per share diluted only as a supplement

contingencies the company leases a facility in the united kingdom under an agreement that expired in june  and the company is currently leasing the facility on a month to month basis 
under the terms of the lease  the company is required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate cost of this provision to the company is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether the company chooses and is permitted to renew the lease term

off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  guarantees as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our goal is to report financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of five channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or through owned dealers  we recognize revenue once the product and services are delivered and installation thereof is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include any freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates 
receivable allowances we base our allowances for receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the current economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the outstanding accounts receivable and historical experience 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at june  and june   respectively 
as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  these allowances totaled percent and percent for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the year over year decrease in the allowance is primarily due to the stabilization of economic conditions and continued financial health of our customers 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of june  and june   were million and million  respectively 
the company is required to perform an annual test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if the asset values are impaired 
the company completed the required annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as of march   and elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and proceed to the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test 
as a result  goodwill of the reporting units was determined to not be impaired as the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying amount 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows and market valuation multiples 
we estimated the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and reconciled the sum of the fair values of the reporting units to total market capitalization of the company plus a control premium 
the control premium represents an estimate associated with obtaining control of the company in an acquisition 
the discount cash flow analysis used the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value 
the company employs a market based approach in selecting the discount rates used in our analysis 
the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what the company believes is what a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to the company reporting units 
the company believes the discount rates selected in the quantitative assessment are appropriate in that  in all cases  they meet or exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in discount rates  though the testing performed in fiscal indicates that even a significant increase in the discount rate would not have changed the conclusion 
the company has early adopted the provisions of accounting standard update  which permits the company to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after considering the totality of events and circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired  then calculating the fair value of such asset is unnecessary 
the quantitative impairment test  when necessary  is based on the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets which is both a market based approach and an income based approach 
the relief from royalty method focuses on the level of royalty payments that the user of an intangible asset would have to pay a third party for the use of the asset if it were not owned by the user 
this method involves estimating theoretical future after tax royalty payments based on the company forecasted revenues attributable to the trade names 
these payments are then discounted to present value utilizing a discount rate that considers the after corporate tax required rate of return applicable to the asset 
the projected revenues reflect the best estimate of management for the trade names  however  actual revenues could differ from our estimates 
the company completed the required annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as of march   and concluded utilizing a combination of the qualitative and quantitative assessment that the trade names were not impaired 
the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what the company believes is what a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size and type to the trade names being tested 
the company believes the discount rates selected are appropriate in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in the discount rates and changes in the discount rate may result in future impairment 
long lived assets the company evaluates other long lived assets and acquired business units for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment risk may be present 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of million 
this asset impairment relates to the nemschoff plant closure and consolidation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the restructuring action which included this fixed asset impairment 
warranty reserve the company stands behind company products and the promises it makes to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct problems with products or services 
the company has established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these obligations 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuation of such reserves is based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and may result in an adjustment to these reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company establishes reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted in response to changing conditions 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company uncertain tax positions 
the company has net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
the company also has foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  reserves are established for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on expected future claims for incurred losses 
the company also establishes reserves for health  prescription drugs  and dental benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
the company also maintains insurance coverage for certain risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
the company health benefits retention level does not include an aggregate stop loss policy 
the company retention levels designated within significant insurance arrangements as of june   are as follows 
in millions retention level per occurrence general liability and auto liability physical damage workers compensation and property health benefits pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows 
discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
the company utilizes the services of an independent actuarial firm to assist in determining the rate 
for the domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a cash flow matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to a published discount curve showing the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon fixed income investments 
the discount rate is set for the international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index in that jurisdiction 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate takes into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations 
interest crediting rate the company uses this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
the company bases this methodology on the historical spread between the year us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is still appropriate 
expected long term rate of return the company bases this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
the company considers likely returns and risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents the long term market return expectation  actual asset returns can and do differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an actuarial loss is generated 
conversely  an actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of june   and june   the net actuarial loss associated with the employee pension and post retirement benefit plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the unrecognized loss decreased from to due primarily to settlement losses that were recognized related to the payment of lump sum benefits from the primary domestic pension plan 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the expense and obligations related to our pension plans 
the company cannot accurately predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether adjustments to the expense or obligation in subsequent years will be significant 
both the june  pension funded status and expense are affected by year end discount rate and expected return on assets assumptions 
any change to these assumptions will be specific to the time periods noted and may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
the effect of the indicated increase decrease in discount rates and expected return on assets is shown below in millions assumption percent change expense june  obligation us international us international discount rate expected return on assets for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  the company uses a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  the company recognizes the change in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a portion of the net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
the company currently estimates this period to be approximately years 
as of june   the deferred net actuarial loss ie the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
stock based compensation the company views stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain employees  non employee directors and officers 
the stock based compensation programs include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance share units  employee stock purchases  and stock options 
the company recognizes expense related to each of these share based arrangements 
the black scholes option pricing model is used in estimating the fair value of stock options issued in connection with compensation programs 
this pricing model requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of the common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of the company common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
in measuring the fair value of stock options issued during fiscal year  we utilized an expected volatility of percent 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
the company assumed an average expected term of years in calculating the fair values of the majority of stock options issued during fiscal refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company encounters matters that raise the potential for contingent liabilities 
in evaluating these matters for accounting treatment and disclosure  the company is required to apply judgment in order to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred 
the company is also required to measure  if possible  the dollar value of such liabilities in determining whether or not recognition in our financial statements is required 
this process involves the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to contingencies 
new accounting standards refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for information related to new accounting standards 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended  that are based on management s beliefs  assumptions  current expectations  estimates  and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy  and the company itself

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets  and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials and assembly components used in its operations 
the largest such costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastics  textiles  wood particleboard  and aluminum components 
the impact from changes in commodity prices decreased the company costs by approximately million during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the net impact of changes in pricing increased net sales by million 
the impact from changes in commodity prices increased the company costs by approximately million during fiscal however this was offset by the net impact of changes in pricing in fiscal which increased net sales by approximately million 
this increase in net sales had the effect of decreasing the company costs as a percent of net sales compared to fiscal the net impact of changes in pricing in fiscal decreased net sales by million  which had the effect of increasing the company costs as a percent of net sales compared to fiscal the company believes market prices for commodities will fluctuate and acknowledges that over time increases on its key direct materials and assembly components are likely 
consequently  it views the prospect of such increases as an outlook risk to the business 
foreign exchange risk the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  united kingdom  and china 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company competitive positions within these markets 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound sterling  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  hong kong dollar and chinese renminbi 
as of june   the company had outstanding  thirteen forward currency instruments designed to offset either net asset or net liability exposure that is denominated in non functional currencies 
one forward contract was placed to offset a million hong kong dollar denominated net asset exposure  two forward contracts were placed to offset a million euro denominated net asset exposure  two forward contracts were placed to offset a million us dollar denominated net asset exposure  and one forward contract was placed to offset a million australian dollar denominated net asset exposure 
one forward contract was placed to offset million british pound sterling denominated net liability exposure and six forward contracts were placed to offset a million usdollar denominated net liability exposure 
as of june   the company had outstanding  ten forward currency instruments designed to offset either net asset or net liability exposure that is denominated in non functional currencies 
two forward contracts were placed to offset a million euro denominated net asset exposure and two forward contracts were placed to offset a million us dollar denominated net asset exposure 
one forward contract was placed to offset million australian dollar denominated net asset exposure 
five forward contracts were placed to offset a million usdollar denominated net liability exposure 
a net loss of million  million and million related to the cost of the foreign currency hedges and remeasuring all foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency was included in net earnings for the years ending june   june  and may   respectively 
these amounts are included in other expenses income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
additionally  the cumulative effect of translating the balance sheet and income statement accounts from the functional currency into the united states dollar increased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total stockholders equity by million and million as of the end of fiscal and fiscal conversely  the effect decreased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total stockholders equity by million as of the end of fiscal interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt for which changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company interest rate swap agreement expired as planned on march  the swap arrangement effectively reduced interest expense by million in fiscal all cash flows related to the company interest rate swap instruments are denominated in us dollars 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows
