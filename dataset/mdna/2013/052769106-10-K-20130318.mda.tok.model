strategy autodesk s vision is to help people imagine  design and create a better world 
we do this by developing software for the world s designers  architects  engineers  and digital artists the people who create the world products  buildings  infrastructure  films  and games 
autodesk serves customers in three primary markets architecture  engineering and construction  manufacturing  and digital media and entertainment 
our goal is to provide our customers with the world s most innovative  and engaging design software and services 
our product and services portfolio allows our customers to digitally visualize  simulate  and analyze their projects  helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions  save time  money  and resources  and become more innovative 
today  complex challenges such as globalization  urbanization  and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness  and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities 
to achieve these goals  we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets  and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio 
by innovating in existing technology categories  we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets 
our products are designed to be easy to learn and use  and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment  a low total cost of ownership  and a rapid return on investment 
in addition  our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products 
the breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage  because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries 
this is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above 
we also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for long term growth and industry leadership 
in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology  our large global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  customers  educational institutions  faculty and students is a key competitive advantage 
this network of relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world 
our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase  deploy  learn  and support our products quickly and easily 
we have a significant number of registered third party developers who create products that work well with autodesk products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 
users with expertise in our products are broadly and globally available from educational institutions and in the existing workforce 
we offer extensive educational programs  including student versions of software  curricula and faculty development 
we have an extensive global community of students who are experienced with our software and poised to become the next generation of professional users thus reducing the cost of training and providing fresh talent for our customers 
our global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  
table of contents customers  educational institutions and students has been developed over our thirty year history 
we believe it is an enduring competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate 
we continually strive to increase the business value of our design tools to our customers in a number of ways 
first  we seek to address an increasing portion of our customers workflow with products that extend the value of our customers digital design information into visualization  analysis and simulation 
second  we seek to improve our product interoperability and usability  thus improving our customers productivity and effectiveness 
third  we continue to develop new ways to deliver capability and value to our customers  such as product suites  cloud and social based services  and delivery of our solutions on mobile devices and new hardware platforms 
fourth  we extend our customers workflow with products for adjacent users and for the customers of our customers  thus increasing the value of the design information our customers produce 
finally  we continue to develop new lines of consumer products and services that are delivered and experienced through the web  tablets  and other mobile devices providing our advanced visualization technologies to consumers a whole new category of autodesk customer 
autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframes and engineering workstations to personal computers 
we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer 
just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago  we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud  social  and mobile computing 
to address this shift  our major business initiatives include our desire to accelerate the business move to the cloud  transform our customers experience  increase industry focus to meet customer demands  and develop more effective marketing 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we undertook a number of important organizational changes to drive the success of our business 
the reorganization included changes to the structure and alignment of our product development and marketing teams and re organization of our sales teams 
while these changes were intended to better serve our customers and drive future growth  we have encountered challenges in the execution of these efforts which have impacted our financial results in the short term 
in order to achieve these organizational changes and to further our strategy  including our continuing shift to cloud and mobile computing  in the third quarter of fiscal year  we commenced a company wide restructuring plan 
the plan included a reduction of approximately positions and the consolidation of eight leased facilities with a total cost of up to million fiscal plan  of which million was incurred during fiscal the termination benefits and facility related liabilities have been substantially paid as of fiscal year ended january  autodesk expects to pay the remainder of the termination benefits and facility related liabilities through the fourth quarter of fiscal for further discussion see note  restructuring reserves  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our growth strategy is predicated upon leading the transition in the industries we serve into the cloud in three ways grow 
we believe sufficient opportunity remains in our pc based software business  and we intend to continue to grow this business 
in particular  we are offering product suites with improved interoperability and usability to enhance our customers productivity 
we are continuing to drive maintenance and new licensing models to better match the business needs of our customers 
we will continue to emphasize developing direct relationships with large  global customers and pursuing opportunities in emerging economies 
transform 
at the same time we grow our desktop software business  we are migrating many of our products to the cloud 
this entails development of new cloud computing infrastructure and redesigning our applications to leverage the cloud 
we are also developing new capabilities that are enabled by the cloud such as collaborative product lifecycle management plm and on line simulation 
our goal is to lead our industry in transitioning to the cloud 
expand 
we believe that the combination of cloud  social and mobile computing affords us the opportunity to expand our business into new markets 
for example  we have added new customers through our consumer products 
we intend to continue to develop our business to both add new customers and find new capabilities to incorporate in our core business 
we believe that expanding our customers portfolios to include our suites presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy 
as our customers in all industries adopt our design suites  we believe they will experience an increase in their productivity and the value of their design data 
for fiscal  revenue from suites increased  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  suites increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy 
much of the growth in the world s construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging economies 
further  emerging economies face many of the 
table of contents challenges that our design technology can help address  for example infrastructure build out 
although revenue from emerging countries decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  we believe that emerging economies continue to present long term growth opportunities for us 
revenue from emerging countries represented and of fiscal and fiscal net revenue  respectively 
while we believe there are long term growth opportunities in emerging economies  conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges  including economic volatility  geopolitical risk  local competition  intellectual property protection  poorly developed business infrastructure  scarcity of talent and software piracy 
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products  technology and businesses 
acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers  however  they entail cost and integration challenges and may  in certain instances  negatively impact our operating margins 
we continually review these trade offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions 
we currently anticipate that we will acquire products  technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 
our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions  including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets  leverage our large global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  customers  educational institutions  and students  improve the performance and functionality of our products  and adequately protect our intellectual property 
if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations  we may not be able to implement our strategy  which could potentially adversely affect our business 
for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item a  risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regularly reevaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of all our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for multiple element arrangements containing only software and software related elements  we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority 
if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license  we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered 
if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services  the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
for multiple elements arrangements involving non software elements  including cloud subscription services  our revenue recognition policy is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc  revenue recognition 
for these arrangements  we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non software elements 
we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group using the residual method as described above 
we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
if we do not believe that collection is probable  the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 
our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure  where distributors sell to resellers  and a 
table of contents one tiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers 
our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor  in a two tiered structure  or reseller  in a one tiered structure  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns  among other criteria 
we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments  regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers 
our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
marketable securities 
at january  we had million of short and long term marketable securities 
marketable securities are stated at fair value 
as described in note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we estimate the fair value of our marketable securities each quarter 
fair value is defined as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets  the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low 
this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities  which we consider to be level assets and level assets 
however  determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level requires significant judgment 
for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our auction rate securities  because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive 
these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment 
whenever possible  we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available  when determining fair value 
business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to assets and liabilities  as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from sales  maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies  the acquired company s trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
when assessing goodwill for impairment  we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
qualitative factors considered in this assessment include cost factors  financial performance  legal  regulatory  contractual  political  business  or other factors  entity specific factors  industry and market considerations  macroeconomic conditions  and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if the two step impairment test is necessary  we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired  or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
for our annual impairment assessment in fiscal  based on a review of the qualitative factors described above  we determined that for each of our platform solutions and emerging business  manufacturing mfg and architecture  engineering and construction aec reporting units  it was more likely than not that the fair vale of the reporting units exceeded the carrying amount 
as a result  we concluded that performing the two step impairment test was not necessary for these reporting units 
for the media and entertainment m e reporting unit  autodesk deemed the two step impairment test was necessary and used a discounted cash flow model which included assumptions regarding projected cash flows 
based on this testing  
table of contents autodesk determined that there was no impairment of goodwill for the m e reporting unit during the year ended january  realizability of long lived assets 
we assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets  other than goodwill  annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable 
we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget  shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the results of past impairment reviews 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess recoverability of these assets 
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models  which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows  we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long lived assets 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 
in addition to our recoverability assessments  we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made  as well as in subsequent quarters 
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets  primarily a result of tax credits  net operating losses  and timing differences for reserves  accrued liabilities  stock options  deferred revenue  purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles  partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries  deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method change on advanced payments and valuation allowances against us and canadian deferred tax assets 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors  including intercompany transfer pricing adjustments 
any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made 
we believe our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
stock based compensation 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award  and recognize expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of certain stock based payment awards including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of a stock based award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends 
the variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted  as needed 
share based compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our commons stock on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
legal contingencies 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings and part ii  item  note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the estimated loss 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters  we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal fiscal year ended as a of net revenue fiscal year ended as a of net revenue january  january  in millions net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses income from operations we experienced mixed results in fiscal during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  net revenue increased and gross profit increased  while income from operations decreased 
contributing to the year over year increases in revenue during fiscal were increases in revenue from maintenance and new seat license revenue 
we experienced increases in revenue for many of our major products  reportable segments and geographic areas during fiscal as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the reasons for these increases are discussed below under the heading results from operations 
revenue from flagship products was of total net revenue during fiscal  an increase of as compared to fiscal revenue from suites was of total net revenue for fiscal  an increase of as compared to fiscal revenue from new and adjacent products was of total net revenue during the fiscal  a decreased of as compared to fiscal we anticipate that  as our new and existing customers migrate from our stand alone products  our revenue from suites will increase as a percentage of revenue and that our revenue from our flagship and new and adjacent products will decline as a percentage of revenue 
while net revenue increased million or for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  our operating expenses increased million or for fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher employee related costs and restructuring charges incurred in fiscal as a result of the fiscal plan 
similarly  income from operations decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and our total operating margin decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal primarily due to higher employee related costs and restructuring charges during fiscal we believe net revenue for fiscal will increase by approximately compared to fiscal we anticipate fiscal operating margin will increase by approximately to basis points compared to fiscal we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us  japan  germany  canada  and the united kingdom 
our revenue was negatively impacted from foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal  as compared to fiscal had applicable exchange rates from fiscal been in effect during fiscal and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal  on a constant currency basis  net revenue would have increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  total spend  defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses  increased both as reported and on a constant currency basis compared to the prior fiscal year 
changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue  total spend and income from operations in future periods 
we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the us dollar 
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions  including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively  tech data 
tech data accounted for and of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year and  respectively 
on october   tech data purchased certain assets of mensch und maschine software mum  which has been a distributor of our products in europe 
the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data  which on a consolidated basis would have accounted for of our net revenue for fiscal years if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal we believe our business is not substantially 
table of contents dependent on tech data 
our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services 
should any of the agreements between tech data and us be terminated for any reason  we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue 
our primary goals for fiscal are to grow revenue from our current levels consistent with seasonal trends  manage our operating margin  and to invest in product functionality and new product lines  including suites offerings  while controlling our operating expenses 
in addition  we will continue to look closely at our cost structure to find ways to improve our operating margin while allowing continued investment in growth and productivity initiatives 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve our financial goals and improve our financial results 
additionally  we believe that unemployment rates and the availability of credit to major industries we serve are important indicators for our business 
if we are unable to successfully achieve our major business initiatives or if global economic conditions deteriorate  we may not achieve our financial goals 
at january   we had  million in cash and marketable securities 
this amount includes the aggregate net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriting discounts and related offering expenses  from our december registered underwritten public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  we completed fiscal with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal our deferred revenue balance at january  included million of customer maintenance contracts  which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts 
the term of our maintenance contracts is typically one year but may be two or three year  or occasionally as long as five years 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal comparatively  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal results of operations fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions net revenue license and other maintenance net revenue by geographic area americas europe  middle east and africa asia pacific net revenue by operating segment platform solutions and emerging business architecture  engineering and construction manufacturing media and entertainment fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue license and other revenue license and other revenue is comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue 
product license revenue includes software license revenue from the sale of new seat licenses  upgrades  product revenue for 
table of contents creative finishing and revenue from on demand software and services 
other revenue includes revenue from consulting  training  autodesk developers network and creative finishing customer support  and is recognized over time  as the services are performed 
total license and other revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue from commercial new seat licenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  all of the increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold 
average net revenue per seat was flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal commercial new seat revenue  as a percentage of license and other revenue  was for fiscal and for fiscal offsetting the increase in commercial new seat license revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the decrease in upgrade revenue 
upgrade revenue decreased during fiscal in comparison to fiscal primarily due to more successful upgrade promotions run during fiscal than in fiscal backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter decreased by million during fiscal from million at january  to million at january  backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 
revenue from the sales of our services  training and support  included in license and other revenue  represented less than of net revenue for all periods presented 
maintenance revenue our maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the subscription program 
our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts 
under our maintenance program  customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available  downloadable training courses and online support 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods 
maintenance revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in commercial maintenance revenue 
the increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to a percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term and a percentage point increase in average net revenue per maintenance seat 
commercial maintenance revenue represented of maintenance revenue for both fiscal and changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in net billings for maintenance contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms 
the term of our maintenance contracts is predominantly one year but may be two or three years or occasionally as long as five years 
net maintenance billings increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal net maintenance billings increased due to early maintenance renewals in advance of a price increase and due to new multi year maintenance contracts 
our deferred revenue balance at january  and january  was million and million  respectively  primarily related to customer maintenance contracts  which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts 
net revenue by geographic area net revenue in the americas geography increased by both as reported and on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from new seats was flat during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in our revenue in this geography was led by the us and canada 
net revenue in the emea geography increased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to a increase in maintenance revenue  partially offset by a decrease in new seat revenue 
the increase in our revenue in this geography was led by ireland  finland and germany  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from sweden and the united kingdom 

table of contents net revenue in the apac geography increased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in new seat revenue and a increase in maintenance revenue 
net revenue expansion in the apac geography during fiscal was led by japan  followed by china and south korea 
net revenue in emerging economies decreased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from brazil  poland and india  partially offset by an increase in revenue from china 
revenue from emerging economies represented of net revenue for fiscal and for fiscal international net revenue represented and of our net revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue 
unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue  including in emerging economies  may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected  and could continue to significantly affect  our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue 
additionally  the us credit rating downgrade and weak global economic conditions that have been characterized by restructuring of sovereign debt  high unemployment  and volatility in the financial markets may impact our future financial results 
net revenue by operating segment we have four reportable segments pseb  aec  mfg and m e 
we have no material inter segment revenue 
net revenue for pseb  which includes our autodesk design suite  increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in revenue from our flagship autocad and autocad lt products 
net revenue for aec increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in revenue from our aec suites  which includes our autodesk building design suite 
net revenue for mfg increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in revenue from our mfg suites  which includes the autodesk product design suite 
net revenue for m e decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an decrease in revenue from our animation product group  which includes our autodesk entertainment creation suite  and a decrease in revenue from creative finishing 
the decrease in animation revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our flagship product  ds max  partially offset by a increase in revenue from our animation suites  which includes our autodesk entertainment creation suite 
the overall decrease in m e revenue is related to a general decrease in the m e industry end market demand  as well as the inclusion of our m e products in other autodesk industry suites 
fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue license and other revenue license and other revenue is comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue 
product license revenue includes software license revenue from the sale of new seat licenses  upgrades  product revenue for creative finishing and revenue from on demand software and services

our maintenance contracts are for a term of predominantly one year  but may be two or three year  or occasionally as long as five year  terms 
net maintenance billings increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was due to an increase in maintenance renewals  new multi year maintenance contracts  and the impact from the upgrade promotions mentioned above in license and other revenue

net revenue in emerging economies increased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to revenue from the russian federation  india  mexico  and brazil 
this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal revenue from emerging economies represented of net revenue for fiscal and for fiscal international net revenue represented and of our net revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue 
unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in 
table of contents those countries and our overall financial performance 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected  and could continue to significantly affect  our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue 
additionally  the us credit rating downgrade and weak global economic conditions that have been characterized by restructuring of sovereign debt  high unemployment  and volatility in the financial markets may impact our future financial results

we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars and slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in costs associated with meeting our major business initiatives 
marketing and sales fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions marketing and sales as a percentage of net revenue marketing and sales expenses include salaries  bonuses  benefits  and stock based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees  and the expense of travel  entertainment and training for such personnel  and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows and expositions  and various sales and promotional programs 
marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing  sales and dealer commissions  rent and occupancy  and the cost of supplies and equipment 
marketing and sales expenses increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher employee related costs from salaries and fringe benefits and stock based compensation primarily associated with increased headcount and merit increases in fiscal these costs were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and advertising costs 
marketing and sales expenses increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher employee related costs related to salaries and fringe benefits primarily associated with increased head count and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses 
as a result  we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in costs as we work towards meeting our major business initiatives

these termination benefits and facility related liabilities have been substantially paid as of fiscal year ended january  see note  restructuring reserves  in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents interest and other income  net the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income  net fiscal year ended january  in millions interest and investment income  net gain loss on foreign currency loss gain on strategic investments other income interest and other income  net for comparability  the presentation of the balances at january  and january  was adjusted to align to current year presentation 
interest and other income  net  decreased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in our net interest and investment income and losses incurred due to impairment of certain strategic investments 
a loss on strategic investments occurs when a net reduction in valuation occurs or an impairment is recorded 
impairment results from the determination that the value of the investment is no longer recoverable 
the decrease in interest and investment income  net  during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to interest expense resulting from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december   and a decrease in the fair value of our trading securities that are marked to market each period 
interest and investment income fluctuates based on average cash  marketable securities and debt balances  average maturities and interest rates 
interest and other income  net  increased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in foreign currency losses 
these losses are due to the impact of re measuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency of the corresponding entity 
the amount of gain loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the period 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point from fiscal to fiscal due to lower state tax expense and various other items  offset in part by increased non deductible stock based compensation expense 
our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by tax benefits associated with closure of audits in fiscal our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits  state income taxes  the tax impact of stock based compensation  accounting for uncertain tax positions  business combinations  us manufacturer deduction  closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits  changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that  if enacted  could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings 
a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries 
our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which us taxes have not previously been provided 

table of contents at january   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 
for additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of  see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other financial information in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap discussed above  we believe the following non gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance 
for the fiscal years ended january   and  our gross profit  gross margin  income from operations  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share on a gaap and non gaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin  operating margin and per share data january  january  january  unaudited gross profit non gaap gross profit gross margin non gaap gross margin income from operations non gaap income from operations operating margin non gaap operating margin net income non gaap net income diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share effective in the second quarter of fiscal  autodesk began excluding gains and losses on strategic investments for purposes of its non gaap financial measures 
prior period non gaap interest and other income expense  net  net income and earnings per share amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation 
for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process  we use non gaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis 
these non gaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
we use non gaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures facilitate comparisons to our historical results and operating guidance as well as that of competitors 
we also use these measures for purposes of determining company wide incentive compensation 
there are limitations in using non gaap financial measures because non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
the non gaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
in addition  they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non gaap financial measures 
we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a non gaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures 
the presentation of non gaap financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the non gaap financial measures are meant to supplement  and be viewed in conjunction with  gaap financial measures 
we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below  and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

prior period non gaap interest and other income expense  net  net income and earnings per share amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation 

table of contents our non gaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following stock based compensation expenses 
we exclude stock based compensation expenses from non gaap measures primarily because they are non cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
we incur amortization of acquisition related purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies 
the amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
goodwill impairment 
this is a non cash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired 
as explained above  management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
restructuring charges benefits  net 
these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions 
in connection with these restructuring actions  we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated  and the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts 
we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing financial results in the current period 
loss gain on strategic investments 
we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments from our non gaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results 
included in these amounts are non cash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components and realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments 
establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets 
this is a non cash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets 
as explained above  management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
discrete tax items 
we exclude the gaap tax provision  including discrete items  from the non gaap measure of income  and include a non gaap tax provision based upon the projected annual non gaap effective tax rate 
discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year  unusual or infrequently occurring items  or the tax impact of certain stock based compensation 
examples of discrete tax items include  but are not limited to  certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years  certain costs related to business combinations  certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law 
management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations 
income tax effects on the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses 
the income tax effects that are excluded from the non gaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses  primarily due to stock based compensation  purchased intangibles and restructuring for gaap and non gaap measures 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products 
our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as general operating expenses for marketing  facilities and overhead costs 
in addition to operating expenses  we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives  which include acquisitions of products  technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program 
see further discussion of these items below 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  million and net accounts receivable of million 
in december  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december   collectively  the senior notes 
in addition  we have a line of credit facility that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to million 
this line of credit facility was entered into in may and expires in during fiscal  we borrowed million under the credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we re paid the outstanding balance on our credit facility with a portion of the 
table of contents net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes issued in december borrowings under the credit facility and the remaining net proceeds from the offering of the senior notes are available for general corporate purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally 
our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates citibank 
in addition  citibank is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our million line of credit 
the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to  million at january  from  million at january  is principally the proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes and the result of cash generated from operations 
these increases to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock net of stock issuance proceeds  acquisitions including business combinations and technology purchases  capital expenditures  and other investing activities 
the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was net income of million increased by the effect of non cash expenses totaling million associated with depreciation  amortization  accretion and stock based compensation 
in addition  net cash flow used by changes in operating assets and liabilities was million 
the primary source of working capital was an increase in deferred revenue due to higher maintenance billings for fiscal compared to fiscal the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to higher billings in fiscal compared to fiscal our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was at january  compared to at january  the increase in days sales outstanding is due to higher billings in the last month of fiscal compared to the last month of fiscal at january   our short term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of million and a cost basis of million 
the portfolio fair value consisted of million invested in commercial paper and corporate securities  million invested in u 
s treasury securities  million invested in us government agency securities  million invested in mutual funds  million invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than days and less than one year  million invested in municipal securities  million invested in sovereign debt and million invested in other short term securities 
at january   million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note  deferred compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following the acquisition of businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to our business  stock repurchases  and capital expenditures  including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications 
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products  technology and businesses 
acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers  however  they entail cost and integration challenges and may  in certain instances  negatively impact our operating margins 
we continually review these trade offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions 
we currently anticipate that we will acquire products  technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 
in fiscal and  we increased spend on acquisitions in comparison to previous years  but our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs  the availability of suitable sellers and technology  and our own financial condition 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world  with substantial amounts held outside of the us certain amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions  but under current us tax law  could be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits 
we have provided for the us income tax liability on foreign earnings  except for foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside the us our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows  external borrowings  or both 
we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal in the event of a weakening of the global economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations 
table of contents and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
our existing credit facility at march  is million of which we have no amounts outstanding 
this credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in addition  as of march   we have million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding 
our revenue  earnings  cash flows  receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy uses foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations 
we use hedge contracts  such as cash flow hedges 
to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions 
in addition  we use hedge contracts  such as balance sheet hedges  to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
as of january  and  we had open cash flow and balance sheet related hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months 
contracts were primarily denominated in euros  japanese yen  swiss francs  british pounds  canadian dollars  and australian dollars 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total fiscal fiscal years fiscal years thereafter in millions notes operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations pension obligations other obligations total other obligations include future sabbatical obligations and asset retirement obligations 
this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  certain purchase obligations as discussed below  long term deferred revenue and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions  since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note  income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
notes consist of senior notes issued in december the notes consisted of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  notes and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities  net of sublease income  computer equipment and other equipment leases 
purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements  it infrastructure costs  and marketing costs 
deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
see note  deferred compensation  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 
pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note  retirement benefit plans  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 

table of contents purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
in addition  we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees  including limited product warranties 
historically  costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant  but because potential future costs are highly variable  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 
issuer purchases of equity securities autodesk stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders  and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders 
the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors  including general market conditions  the volume of employee stock option exercises  stock issuance  the trading price of our common stock  cash on hand and available in the us  and company defined trading windows 
during the three and twelve months ended january   we repurchased million and million shares of our common stock  respectively 
at january   million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorizations 
this program does not have a fixed expiration date 
see note  stockholders equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k

the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions 
a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  indicated that a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january  and would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical depreciation of the dollar from its value at january  and would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and the market value of certain longer term securities 
at january   we had  million of cash equivalents and marketable securities  
table of contents including million classified as short term marketable securities and million classified as long term marketable securities 
if interest rates were to move up or down by and basis points over a twelve month period  the market value change of our marketable securities would be million and million  respectively 
other market risk from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies 
the privately held companies in which we invest are considered inherently risky 
the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies  which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies
