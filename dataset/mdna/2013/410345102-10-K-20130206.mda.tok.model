overview our company we are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands  including hanes  champion  bali  playtex  just my size  l eggs  barely there  wonderbra  gear for sports  zorba  sol y oro and rinbros 
we design  manufacture  source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  casualwear  activewear  socks and hosiery 
according to npd  our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete  for the month period ended november  discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we narrowed the focus of our worldwide imagewear business  which led us to sell our european imagewear business and discontinue our private label and outer banks domestic imagewear operations that served wholesalers that sell to the screen print industry 
the sale of our european imagewear business to smartwares  bv for million approximately million  net of fees and other transaction related costs in cash proceeds  resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately million 
the sale of our european imagewear business is consistent with our strategic direction to narrow the focus of our worldwide imagewear business by restructuring to exit noncore segments and reduce risk 
in connection with the discontinuation of our private label and outer banks domestic imagewear operations  we incurred pre tax charges of approximately million in  substantially all noncash  for the write down of intangibles  inventory markdowns and other related items 
the execution of our new worldwide imagewear strategy allows us to focus our imagewear business now known as branded printwear on hanes and champion branded products in the united states with improved operating margins 
this restructuring is expected to result in a smaller  more profitable and less volatile operation in the longer term 
our branded printwear operations will continue to operate and serve the branded domestic screen print market with the results of these operations being reported in the outerwear segment 

table of contents as a result of these actions  the current year and prior year disclosures reflect these operations as discontinued operations 
our segments as a result of the reduced size of our sheer hosiery business and changing trends  we decided in the first quarter of to change our external segment reporting to include hosiery operations within the innerwear segment 
hosiery had previously been reported as a separate segment 
prior year segment sales and operating profit results  including other minor allocation changes  have been revised to conform to the current year presentation 
as a result of these changes  our operations are now managed and reported in the following reportable segments innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of intimate apparel  men s underwear  kids underwear and socks 
outerwear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature under the product categories of casualwear and activewear to both retailers and wholesalers  as well as licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores and other channels 
direct to consumer includes our value based outlet stores and internet operations which sell products from our portfolio of leading brands 
our internet operations are supported by its catalogs 
international primarily relates to the asia  latin america  canada and australia geographic locations which sell products that span across the innerwear and outerwear reportable segments 
outlook for for  we expect net sales of approximately billion  operating profit of million to million and diluted earnings per share of to 
we expect a decline in branded printwear net sales of million to million  with approximately half of that decline occurring in the first quarter  reflecting the rationalization that started in mid we intend to increase our overall media investment in by million to million  of which more than two thirds will occur in the second half 
through operating results and continued improvements in working capital  we expect to generate approximately million to million of operating cash flows in  which includes expected pension contributions of approximately million 
we ended with billion in bond debt 
in  we expect the primary use of cash flows will be for the prepayment of the remaining million of senior notes 
business and industry trends inflation and changing prices we experienced a sustained increase in various input costs  such as cotton and oil related materials  utilities  freight and wages  during and the first half of  and we may experience similar increases in the future 
our results in were impacted by this cost inflation by approximately million 
however  with the recent decline in cotton prices  the most significant contributor to our cost inflation is now behind us 
based on current market conditions  we expect a reduction in input costs in primarily as a result of lower cotton costs 
cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products 
while we have sold our yarn operations  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large scale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins 
decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased  particularly if there is 
table of contents downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand  competition or other factors 
price increases  including those implemented in response to higher prices for cotton and other raw materials  contributed favorably to net sales growth and positively affected margins in our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by  among other factors  weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton 
under our agreements with these suppliers  we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases 
when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements  interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn 
the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers 
however  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only approximately of our cost of sales  it rose to around in primarily as a result of cost inflation 
costs incurred today for materials and labor  including cotton  typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months later 
inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins 
for example  the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process  such as oil related commodities and other raw materials  such as dyes and chemicals  and other costs  such as fuel  energy and utility costs  can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors 
costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold 
in addition  a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the united states and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs 
increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income  which also could have a negative impact on spending 
other business and industry trends the basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly 
competition is generally based upon brand name recognition  price  product quality  selection  service and purchasing convenience 
the majority of our core styles continue from year to year  with variations only in color  fabric or design details 
some products  however  such as intimate apparel  activewear and sheer hosiery  do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation 
our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers  as well as smaller companies  department stores  specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands 
our top customers accounted for of our net sales 
our largest customers in were wal mart  target and kohl s  which accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
the increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products  while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products 
to counteract these effects  it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today s challenging economic environment 
brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demand 
our key business strategies our key business strategies are focused on optimizing our strong brands to drive modest sales growth domestically and internationally  using our low cost global supply chain and implementing cost savings initiatives to expand margins  and delivering strong cash flow to create value 

table of contents we seek to drive modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value 
our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry 
according to npd  our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete  for the month period ended november  internationally  our commercial markets include mexico  canada  japan  india  brazil and china  where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the united states will be concentrated over the next decade 
our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success 
our design  research and product development teams  in partnership with our marketing teams  drive our efforts to bring innovations to market 
we seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing  addressing changing customer needs and industry trends 
we also support our key brands with targeted  effective advertising and marketing campaigns 
we seek to expand margins through optimizing our low cost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs 
we believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies  purchasing power and product design  marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors 
our global supply chain spans across both the western and eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply  which relies on a combination of owned  contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions  increases the efficiency of our operations  reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply 
our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres  thereby diversifying our production risks 
our textile production plant in nanjing  china  along with our other textile facilities and arrangements with outside contractors  enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres to support our production capacity 
we have generated significant cost savings  margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and will continue to do so as we further optimize our size  scale and production capability 
we generated efficiency savings from our supply chain optimization initiatives of approximately million during we seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels 
our strong cash flows have resulted in a flexible long term capital structure that is able to deliver shareholder value in numerous ways  including debt reduction and our ability to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 
in addition  we intend to continue to improve turns for inventory which will also contribute to strong cash flows in seasonality and other factors our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors 
generally  our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items 
we generally have higher sales during the back to school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather  which benefits certain product categories such as fleece 
sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand 
our customers may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us 
media  advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions 
although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned  rather than on an impulse  basis  our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others  general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  gasoline prices  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
many of these factors are outside our control 
consumers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower  when prices increase in response to rising costs  or in periods of 
table of contents actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lower priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products  or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time 
changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products  such as intimate apparel and men s underwear  and lower margin products  such as casualwear and activewear  fluctuate from time to time 
in addition  sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time 
our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us  which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict 
however  certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature  as sales of socks  hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather  back to school shopping and holidays  while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers preferences and discretionary spending

table of contents accounts receivable securitization facility the accounts receivable securitization facility provides for up to million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing  limited to the availability of eligible receivables  and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables

the assets and liabilities of receivables llc are fully reflected on the consolidated balance sheet  and the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting purposes  but the assets of receivables llc will be used first to satisfy the creditors of receivables llc  not the company s creditors 
the borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility remain outstanding throughout the term of the agreement subject to us maintaining sufficient eligible receivables  by continuing to sell trade receivables to receivables llc  unless an event of default occurs 
the accounts receivable securitization facility will terminate on march   however  we plan to extend the term 
availability of funding under the accounts receivable securitization facility depends primarily upon the eligible outstanding receivables balance

floating rate senior notes on december   we issued million aggregate principal amount of the floating rate senior notes 
the net proceeds from the sale of the floating rate senior notes were approximately million 
these proceeds  together with working capital  were used to repay an outstanding debt balance under another loan facility 
during  we completed the redemption of all amounts owed under the floating rate senior notes

table of contents undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries as of december   the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately billion  of which million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested  and less than million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are not considered permanently reinvested 
our intention is to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings we have previously asserted as being permanently reinvested in our international operations 
we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient other sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently 
we repatriated million  million and million in  and  respectively  from earnings generated in such years 
the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has been determined  and the amount that we expect to repatriate during will be determined  based upon a variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries  foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us  such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations 
the majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at year end  although we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business 
when we repatriate funds to the us  we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates  net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax 
we paid  million and million in additional us federal income taxes in  and  respectively  as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years 
we do not currently expect the amount of repatriated foreign earnings or the resulting additional tax expense in to differ materially from prior fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our financial statements 
the application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements  or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors  are described below sales recognition and incentives we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
note d  summary of significant accounting policies sales recognition and incentives  to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products 
measuring the cost of these incentives requires  in many cases  estimating future customer utilization 
table of contents and redemption rates 
we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information 
we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of income 
accounts receivable valuation accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling  general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a large reserve might be required 
the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts 
inventory valuation we carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out  or fifo  method for our inventories 
we carry obsolete  damaged  and excess inventory at the net realizable value  which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates  current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans 
because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time  there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination 
market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change  resulting in further reserve requirements 
a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item  and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities  as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions  the amount and timing of which are uncertain  and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies 
if in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized  valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets  which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 
we have not provided federal income taxes on that portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings that is permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions 
if we decided to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements  our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate could be impacted 

table of contents we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  expiration of statutes of limitations  as well as changes to  or further interpretations of  tax laws and regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which these events occur 
stock compensation we established the hanesbrands inc omnibus incentive plan of the omnibus incentive plan to award stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  deferred stock units  performance shares and cash to our employees  non employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees 
stock based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
estimation of stock based compensation for stock options granted  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life 
we use a combination of the volatility of our company and the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions 
we utilize the simplified method outlined in sec accounting rules to estimate expected lives for options granted 
the simplified method is used for valuing stock option grants by eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees 
we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted that are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
defined benefit pension plans for a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost  plan obligations  plan assets  and how we measure the amount of these costs  see note  defined benefit pension plans  to our consolidated financial statements 
under the pension protection act funding rules  our us qualified pension plan is approximately funded as of december  compared to funded as of december  the increase in the funded status is primarily driven by a decrease in long term pension liabilities as a result of recently passed pension funding relief  in addition to an increase in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the market s performance during in july  the us congress signed the map bill into law 
included in this legislation was pension funding relief stabilization  which allows us corporate defined benefit plans to temporarily use longer term average discount rates to value its long term pension liabilities on an actuarial basis 
by utilizing higher discount rates in the calculation of the plans benefit obligation  our minimum required contributions are reduced during the relief period 
map funding benefits will phase out by we expect to make required cash contributions of approximately million to our pension plans in based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary 
in addition to the required cash contributions  we may elect to make voluntary contributions to maintain an funded level which will avoid certain benefit payment restrictions under the pension protection act 
we expect pension expense in of approximately million compared to million in see note  defined benefit pension plans  to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset components 
the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet and changes in the funded status are reflected in comprehensive income 
we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end 
the net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred 
gains and losses  which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions  are amortized over the average future expected life of participants 

table of contents our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows in determining the discount rate  we utilized the aon hewitt aa above median curve rounded to the nearest basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan 
this methodology represents a change from using the citigroup pension discount curve in prior years 
we consider the aon hewitt aa above median curve a more appropriate model to determine the discount rates for our plans 
salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans  as benefits under these plans are not frozen 
the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of december  in determining the long term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical long term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments  and the utilization of forward looking assumptions 
retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality 
the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans benefit obligations  all other factors being equal  is illustrated by the following increase decrease in in millions pension expense benefit obligation decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate decrease in expected investment return n a increase in expected investment return n a trademarks and other identifiable intangibles trademarks  license agreements  customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets 
all of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives  therefore we amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives 
we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors  including the effects of demand  competition  expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows 
as of december   the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was million  of which we are amortizing the entire balance 
we anticipate that our amortization expense for will be million 
we evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
during  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million related to our outer banks trademark and write off of goodwill in connection with the discontinuation of our outer banks domestic imagewear operations 
please see discontinued operations in this annual report on form k for more information 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
the timing of our annual goodwill 
table of contents impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter 
the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter  and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units 
we relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles  there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors  and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at its historical cost  and we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the asset s life 
we estimate an asset s life based on historical experience  manufacturers estimates  engineering or appraisal evaluations  our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us  which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life 
our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization 
a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods 
we test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
we evaluate an asset s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
when we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use  we depreciate the asset s adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life 
we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change 
recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in december  the fasb issued new accounting rules related to new disclosure requirements regarding the nature of an entity s rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the new rules are effective for us in the first quarter of with retrospective application required 
we do not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
presentation of comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued a new rule related to the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income that requires entities to report  either on their income statement or in a footnote to their financial statements  the effects on earnings from items that are reclassified out of other comprehensive income 
the new accounting rules are effective for us in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

foreign exchange risk we sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars  however  we purchase some raw materials  pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates

we are required under the senior secured credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance 
we are in compliance with this provision as a result of our senior notes and senior notes which bear interest at fixed rates 
approximately of our total debt outstanding at december  is at a fixed rate 
given a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed rates  a basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of december  would only result in a change in annual interest expense of million 
commodities cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products 
while we have sold our yarn operations  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large scale yarn suppliers  while decreases in cotton prices can result in inventory comprised of products made from higher cost yarn and in our purchase of cotton at contractually fixed prices that are above the current market rate 
our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by  among other things  weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton 
under our agreements with these suppliers  we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases 
when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements  interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn 
the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers 
however  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only of our cost of sales  it has risen to around primarily as a result of cost inflation 
costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold 
for example  we estimate that an increase of per pound in cotton prices at current levels of production would affect our annual cost of sales by million related to finished goods manufactured internally in our manufacturing facilities and million related to finished goods sourced by third parties 
the 
table of contents ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified  as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain  but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
additionally  significant decreases in the price of cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production  which could result in lower gross margins  particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure 
in addition  fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products  such as chemicals  dyestuffs  polyester yarn and foam 
we generally purchase raw materials at market prices 
we estimate that a change of per barrel in the price of oil would affect our freight costs by approximately million  at current levels of usage
