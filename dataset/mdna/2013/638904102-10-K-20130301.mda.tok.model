item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please refer to note on forward looking statements and risk factors for more information 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an international insurance company focusing on specialty products within the overall property and casualty insurance market 
our largest product line and most long standing area of specialization is ocean marine insurance 
we have also developed other specialty insurance lines such as commercial primary and excess liability as well as specialty niches in professional liability  and have expanded our specialty reinsurance business since launching navigators re in the fourth quarter of our revenue is primarily comprised of premiums and investment income 
we derive our premiums primarily from business written by wholly owned underwriting management companies which produce  manage and underwrite insurance and reinsurance for us 
our products are distributed through multiple channels  utilizing global  national and regional retail and wholesale insurance brokers 
we conduct operations through our insurance companies and our lloyd s operations segments 
the insurance companies segment consists of navigators insurance company  which includes a united kingdom branch the uk branch  and navigators specialty insurance company  which underwrites specialty and professional liability insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis 
all of the insurance business written by navigators specialty insurance company is fully reinsured by navigators insurance company pursuant to a quota share reinsurance agreement 
the insurance and reinsurance business written by our insurance companies is underwritten through our wholly owned underwriting management companies  navigators management company  inc nmc and navigators management uk ltd 
nmuk 
our lloyd s operations segment includes navigators underwriting agency ltd 
nual  a lloyd s of london lloyd s underwriting agency which manages lloyd s syndicate syndicate 
our lloyd s operations primarily underwrite marine and related lines of business along with offshore energy  professional liability insurance and construction coverages for onshore energy business at lloyd s through syndicate we controlled of syndicate s stamp capacity for the  and underwriting years through our wholly owned subsidiary  navigators corporate underwriters ltd 
which is referred to as a corporate name in the lloyd s market 
we have also established underwriting agencies in antwerp  belgium  stockholm  sweden  and copenhagen  denmark  which underwrite risks pursuant to binding authorities with nual into syndicate we have also established a presence in brazil and china through contractual arrangements with local affiliates of lloyd s 
while management takes into consideration a wide range of factors in planning our business strategy and evaluating results of operations  there are certain factors that management believes are fundamental to understanding how we are managed 
first  underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as a primary goal  above premium growth 
management s assessment of our trends and potential growth in underwriting profit is the dominant factor in its decisions with respect to whether or not to expand a business line  enter into a new niche  product or territory or  conversely  to contract capacity in any business line 
in addition  management focuses on controlling the costs of our operations 
management believes that careful monitoring of the costs of existing operations and assessing the costs of potential growth opportunities are important to our profitability 
access to capital also has a significant impact on management s outlook for our operations 
the insurance companies operations and ability to grow their business and take advantage of market opportunities are constrained by regulatory capital requirements and rating agency assessments of capital adequacy 
similarly  the ability to grow our operations at lloyd s is subject to capital and operating requirements of lloyd s and the uk regulatory authorities 

table of contents management s decisions are also greatly influenced by access to specialized underwriting and claims expertise in our lines of business 
we have chosen to operate in specialty niches with certain common characteristics which we believe provide us with the opportunity to use our technical underwriting expertise in order to realize underwriting profit 
as a result  we have focused on underserved markets for businesses characterized by higher severity and lower frequency of loss where we believe our intellectual capital and financial strength bring meaningful value 
in contrast  we have avoided niches that we believe have a high frequency of loss activity and or are subject to a high level of regulatory requirements  such as workers compensation and personal automobile insurance  because we do not believe our technical underwriting expertise is of as much value in these types of businesses 
examples of niches that have the characteristics we look for include offshore energy which provides coverage for physical damage to  for example  high value offshore oil drilling rigs  and directors and officers d o insurance which covers litigation exposure of a corporation s directors and officers 
these types of exposures require substantial technical expertise 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of severe claims on our results by conservative and detailed underwriting  prudent use of reinsurance and a balanced portfolio of risks 
for additional information regarding our business  refer to business overview  included herein 
ratings our ability to underwrite business is dependent upon the financial strength of the insurance companies and lloyd s 
financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies 
independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets 
the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company  including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities 
we could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in the insurance companies or lloyd s financial strength ratings  including a possible reduction in demand for our products  higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets 
for the insurance companies  navigators insurance company and navigators specialty insurance company utilize the financial strength ratings from am best and s p for underwriting purposes 
navigators insurance company and navigators specialty insurance company are both rated a excellent stable outlook by am best and a strong negative outlook by s p 
syndicate utilizes the ratings from am best and s p for underwriting purposes which apply to all lloyd s syndicates 
lloyd s is rated a excellent stable outlook by am best and a strong stable outlook by s p 
debt ratings apply to short term and long term debt as well as preferred stock 
these ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of the principal and interest for our senior debt 
it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing debt ratings 
if one or more of our debt ratings were downgraded  we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
we utilize the senior debt ratings from s p 
our senior debt is rated bbb adequate negative outlook by s p 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
the following accounting estimates are viewed by management to be critical because they require significant judgment on the part of management 
management has discussed and reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
financial results could be materially different if other methodologies were used or if management modified its assumptions 

table of contents our most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of the reserves for losses and lae including losses that have occurred but were not reported to us by the financial reporting date  reinsurance recoverables  written and unearned premium  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the impairment of investment securities and accounting for lloyd s results 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves for losses and lae represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on facts and circumstances then known less the amount paid to date 
actuarial methodologies are employed to assist in establishing such estimates and include judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors which are often beyond our control 
no assurance can be given that actual claims made and related payments will not be in excess of the amounts reserved 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves include interpreting loss development activity  emerging economic and social trends  inflation  changes in the regulatory and judicial environment and changes in our operations  including changes in underwriting standards and claims handling procedures 
the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into account many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
our actuaries calculate indicated ibnr loss reserves for each line of business by underwriting year for major products principally using standard actuarial methodologies which are projection or extrapolation techniques the loss ratio method  the loss development method and the bornheutter ferguson method 
in general the loss ratio method is used to calculate the ibnr for only the most recent underwriting years or in the absence of any statistical data upon which to estimate ultimate losses while the bornheutter ferguson method is used to calculate the ibnr for recent years where a statistical basis exists for that computation with the loss development method used for more mature underwriting years 
when appropriate such methodologies are supplemented by the frequency severity method  which are used to analyze and better comprehend loss development patterns and trends in the data when making selections and judgments 
each of these methodologies  which are described below  are generally applicable to both long tail and short tail lines of business depending on a variety of circumstances 
in utilizing these methodologies to develop our ibnr loss reserves  a key objective of management in making their final selections is to deliberate with our actuaries to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them 
this process requires the substantial use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain as it can be influenced by numerous factors including inflationary pressures medical and economic that affect the size of losses  judicial  regulatory  legislative  and legal decisions that affect insurers liabilities  changes in the frequency and severity of losses  changes in the underlying loss exposures of our policies  changes in our claims handling procedures 
for non statistical claim events  ie  where historical patterns are not available for applicable  expert judgment by claims professionals with input from underwriting and management are used 
such instances relate to the ibnr loss reserve processes for our hurricanes losses and our asbestos exposures 

table of contents a brief summary of each actuarial method discussed above follows loss ratio method this method is based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
pursuant to the loss ratio method  ibnr loss reserves are calculated by multiplying the earned premium by an expected ultimate loss ratio to estimate the ultimate losses for each underwriting year  then subtracting the reported losses  consisting of paid losses and case loss reserves  to determine the ibnr loss reserve amount 
the ultimate loss ratios applied are the company s best estimates for each underwriting year and are generally determined after evaluating a number of factors which include information derived by underwriters and actuaries in the initial pricing of the business  the ultimate loss ratios established in the prior accounting period and the related judgments applied  the ultimate loss ratios of previous underwriting years  premium rate changes  underwriting and coverage changes  changes in terms and conditions  legislative changes  exposure trends  loss development trends  claim frequency and severity trends  paid claims activity  remaining open case reserves and industry data where deemed appropriate 
such factors are also evaluated when selecting ultimate loss ratios and or loss development factors in the methods described below 
bornheutter ferguson method the bornheutter ferguson method calculates the ibnr loss reserves as the product of the earned premium  an expected ultimate loss ratio  and a loss development factor that represents the expected percentage of the ultimate losses that have been incurred but not yet reported 
the loss development factor equals one hundred percent less the expected percentage of losses that have thus far been reported  which is generally calculated as an average of the percentage of losses reported for comparable reporting periods of prior underwriting years 
the expected ultimate loss ratio is generally determined in the same manner as in the loss ratio method 
loss development method the loss development method  also known as the chainladder or the link ratio method  develops the ibnr loss reserves by multiplying the paid or reported losses by a loss development factor to estimate the ultimate losses  then subtracting the reported losses  consisting of paid losses and case loss reserves  to determine the ibnr loss reserves 
the loss development factor is the reciprocal of the expected percentage of losses that have thus far been reported  which is generally calculated as an average of the percentage of losses reported for comparable reporting periods of prior underwriting years 
frequency severity method the frequency severity method calculates the ibnr loss reserves by separately projecting claim count and average cost per claim data on either a paid or incurred basis 
it estimates the expected ultimate losses as the product of the ultimate number of claims that are expected to be reported and the expected average amount of these claims 
actuarial loss studies are conducted by the company s actuaries at various times throughout the year for major lines of business employing the methodologies as described above 
additionally  a review of the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations for each line of business  generally derived from the annual loss studies  is conducted each quarter to determine whether the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a reasonable basis for the projection of liabilities for each product line 
such reviews may result in maintaining or revising assumptions regarding future loss development based on various quantitative and qualitative considerations 
if actual loss activity differs from expectations  an upward or downward adjustment to loss reserves may occur 
as time passes  estimated loss reserves for an underwriting year will be based more on historical loss activity and loss development patterns rather than on assumptions based on underwriters input  pricing assumptions or industry experience 
the following discusses the method used for calculating the ibnr for each line of business and key assumptions used in applying the actuarial methods described 

table of contents marine generally  two key assumptions are used by our actuaries in setting ibnr loss reserves for major products in this line of business 
the first assumption is that our historical experience regarding paid and reported losses for each product where we have sufficient history can be relied on to predict future loss activity 
the second assumption is that our underwriters assessments as to potential loss exposures are reliable indicators of the level of our expected loss activity 
the specific loss reserves for marine are then analyzed separately by product based on such assumptions  except where noted below  with the major products including marine liability  cargo  p i  transport and bluewater hull 
the claims emergence patterns for various marine product lines vary substantially 
our largest marine product line is marine liability  which has one of the longer loss development patterns 
marine liability protects an insured s business from liability to third parties stemming from their marine related operations  such as terminal operations  stevedoring and marina operations 
since marine liability claims generally involve a dispute as to the extent and amount of legal liability that our insured has to a third party  these claims tend to take a longer time to develop and settle 
other longer tail marine product lines include p i insurance  which provides coverage for third party liability as well as injury to crew for vessel operators  and transport insurance  which provides both property and third party liability on a primary basis to businesses such as port authorities  marine terminal operators and others engaged in the infrastructure of international transportation 
other marine product lines have considerably shorter periods in which losses develop and settle 
ocean cargo insurance  for example  provides physical damage coverage to goods in the course of transit by water  air or land 
by their nature  cargo claims tend to be reported quickly as losses typically result from an obvious peril such as fire  theft or weather 
similarly  bluewater hull insurance provides coverage against physical damage to ocean going vessels 
such claims for physical damage generally are discovered  reported and settled quickly 
the company currently has extensive experience for all of these products and thus the ibnr loss reserves for all of the marine products are determined using the key assumptions and actuarial methodologies described above 
prior to  however  as discussed below  the company did not have sufficient experience in the transport product line and instead used its hull and liability products loss development experience as a key assumption in setting the ibnr loss reserves for its transport product 
property casualty the reserves for property and casualty are established separately by product with the major product being contractors liability insurance 
other products include offshore energy  commercial middle markets  primary casualty  excess casualty and specialty reinsurance 
our actuaries generally utilize two key assumptions in this line of business first  that our historical loss development patterns are reasonable predictors of future loss patterns and second  that our claims personnel s assessment of our claims exposures and our underwriters assessment of our expected losses are reliable indicators of our loss exposure 
however  this line of business includes a number of products where there is insufficient company historical experience to project loss reserves and or loss development is sparse or erratic  which makes extrapolation techniques for those products extremely difficult to apply  and in those circumstances we typically rely more on industry data and our underwriters input in setting assumptions for our ibnr loss reserves as opposed to historical loss development patterns 
in addition  as discussed in more detail below with respect to construction defect reserves  our actuaries may take other market trends or events into account in setting ibnr loss reserves 
the substantial portion of the property and casualty loss reserves are for the contractors liability business  which insures mostly general and artisan contractors 
contractor liability claims are categorized into two claim types construction defect and other general liability 
other general liability claims typically derive from workplace accidents or from negligence alleged by third parties  and frequently take a long time to report and settle 
construction defect claims involve the discovery of damage to buildings that was caused by latent construction defects 
these claims take a very long time to report and to settle compared to other general liability claims 
since construction defect claims report much later than other contractor liability claims  they are analyzed separately in an annual actuarial loss study 

table of contents we have extensive history in the contractors liability business upon which to perform actuarial analyses and we use the key assumption noted above relating to our own historical experience as a reliable indicator of the future for this product 
however  there is inherent uncertainty in the loss reserve estimation process for this line of business given both the long tail nature of the liability claims and the continuing underwriting and coverage changes  claims handling and reserve changes  and legislative changes that have occurred over a several year period 
such factors are judgmentally taken into account in this line of business in specific periods 
the underwriting and coverage changes include the migration to a non admitted business from admitted business in  which allowed us to exclude certain exposures previously permitted for example  exposure to construction work performed prior to the policy inception  withdrawals from certain contractor classes previously underwritten and expansion into new states beginning in claims changes include bringing the claim handling in house in and changes in case reserving practices in  and during and  we also significantly increased our claims staff and improved our claims procedures  which has allowed the company to respond more quickly to reported construction defect claims 
the company is closely monitoring the impact of these effects on the adequacy of our case and ibnr loss reserves 
after analysis of the factors above  management believes that our reserves remain adequate to address our exposure to construction defect losses  but given the uncertainties noted above  there is a risk that our reserves for construction defect losses may ultimately prove to be inadequate  perhaps in a material manner 
offshore energy provides physical damage coverage to offshore oil platforms along with offshore operations related to oil exploration and production 
the significant offshore energy claims are generally caused by fire or storms  and thus tend to be large  infrequent  quickly reported  but occasionally not quickly settled because the damage is often extensive but not always immediately known 
primary casualty insurance provides primary general liability coverage principally to corporations in the construction  real estate and manufacturing sector 
excess casualty insurance is purchased by corporations which seek higher limits of liability than are provided in their primary casualty policies 
specialty assumed reinsurance provides proportional and excess of loss treaty coverage for several niche lines accident health a h  agriculture  latin america  and professional liability 
the a h reinsurance line primarily provides reinsurance coverage for large individual medical claims that occur with small frequency 
the agriculture reinsurance line primarily provides reinsurance coverage related to crop insurance schemes  most of which are sponsored by governmental bodies in the us and canada 
the latin america line primarily provides reinsurance coverage for individual risk and catastrophic property exposures  liability exposures  and surety bonds in central and south america and the spanish speaking caribbean 
the professional liability line primarily provides reinsurance coverage for exposure related to medical malpractice and other miscellaneous professional liability policies 
professional liability the professional liability policies mainly provide coverage on a claims made basis mostly for a one year period 
the reserves for professional liability are analyzed separately by product 
the major products are d o liability coverage and e o liability coverage for lawyers and other professionals 
the losses for d o business are generally very large and infrequent  and with some cases involving securities class actions 
d o claims report reasonably quickly  but take years to settle 
our loss estimates are based on expected losses  an assessment of the characteristics of reported losses at the claim level  evaluation of loss trends  industry data  and the legal  regulatory and current risk environment 
significant judgment is involved because anticipated loss experience in this area is less predictable due to the small number of claims and or erratic claim severity patterns 
as time passes for a given underwriting year  we place additional weight on assumptions relating to our actual experience and claims outstanding 
the expected ultimate losses may be adjusted up or down as the underwriting years mature 

table of contents lloyd s operations reserves for the company s lloyd s operations are reviewed separately for the marine  property and casualty  and professional liability lines by product 
the major marine products are marine liability  transport  marine energy liability  offshore energy  cargo  specie and marine reinsurance 
the major property and casualty products are offshore energy  engineering  onshore energy and operational engineering 
the major products for professional liability are international d o and international e o 
the marine liability  offshore energy and cargo products and related loss exposures are similar in nature to that described for marine business above 
specie insurance provides property coverage for jewelry  fine art  vault and cash in transit risks 
claims tend to be from theft or damage  quick to report and  in most cases  quick to settle 
marine reinsurance is a diversified global book of reinsurance  the majority of which consists of excess of loss reinsurance policies for which claims activity tends to be large and infrequent with loss development somewhat longer than for such products written on a direct basis 
marine reinsurance reinsures liability  cargo  hull and offshore energy exposures that are similar in nature to the marine business described above 
the process for establishing the ibnr loss reserves for the marine and professional liability lines of the lloyd s operations  and the assumptions used as part of this process  are similar in nature to the process employed by the insurance companies 
the lloyd s operations products also include property coverages for engineering and construction projects and onshore energy business  which are substantially reinsured 
losses from engineering and construction projects tend to result from loss of use due to construction delays while losses from onshore energy business are usually caused by fires or explosions 
large losses tend to be catastrophic in nature and are heavily reinsured 
ibnr loss reserves for attritional losses are established based on the syndicate s extensive loss experience 
sensitivity analysis a range of reasonable estimates has been developed based on the historical volatility of held reserves vs 
current estimates 
the actuarial history indicates that navigators held reserves tend to be redundant with a standard deviation of 
we have ignored the historical conservatism and built a range around the current held amounts 
the company s lines of business  the market pricing adequacy and the company s underwriting strategies have changed dynamically over the past eleven years 
there is thus a significant risk that the potential volatility of the current reserve estimates could differ in a material manner from the historical trends 
actual emergence will vary and may exceed the historical variation 
the actual losses may not emerge as expected which would cause the ranges to expand or contract from year to year 
the impact from the shift on ranges will be greater for lines with longer emergence patterns 
the individual lines will also have greater variance than the range for the entire book of business 
the statistical variation is expected to have a somewhat higher range of deterioration than savings 
the history in itself is only a rough estimate of the potential volatility 
the ranges have been refined by reserve segment in three categories marine  property casualty and professional liability 
these groupings give a sense of the volatility by sub group but are not intended to be rigorous estimates even if such were possible 
the total reserve variability is not equal to the sum of the segment variability due to the benefit of diversification

the portfolio effect is the reduction in risk which arises out of diversification in the portfolio 
calculated using average diluted shares of  for the year ended december  reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverables are established for the portion of the loss reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based upon the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers which can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
additional information regarding our reinsurance recoverables can be found in the business reinsurance recoverables section and note  reinsurance  to our consolidated financial statements  both included herein 

table of contents written and unearned premium written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to us and the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
we must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
reinsurance reinstatement premium is earned in the period in which the event occurred which created the need to record the reinstatement premium 
additional information regarding our written and unearned premium can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  reinsurance  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  both included herein 
substantially all of our business is placed through agents and brokers 
we record estimates for both unreported direct and assumed premium 
we also record the ceded portion of the estimated gross written premium and related acquisition costs 
the earned gross  ceded and net premiums are calculated based on our earning methodology which is generally pro rata over the policy period 
losses are also recorded in relation to the earned premium 
the estimate for losses incurred on the estimated premium is based on an actuarial calculation consistent with the methodology used to determine incurred but not reported loss reserves for reported premiums 
a portion of our premium is estimated for unreported premium  mostly for the marine business written by our uk branch and lloyd s operations as well as the accident health and latin american caribbean property casualty and surety reinsurance business written by navre 
we generally do not experience any significant backlog in processing premiums 
such premium estimates are generally based on submission data received from brokers and agents and recorded when the insurance policy or reinsurance contract is written or bound 
the estimates are regularly reviewed and updated taking into account the premium received to date versus the estimate and the age of the estimate 
to the extent that the actual premium varies from the estimates  the difference  along with the related loss reserves and underwriting expenses  is recorded in current operations 
deferred tax assets we apply the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
additional information regarding our deferred tax assets can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  both included herein 
impairment of invested assets management regularly reviews our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
for fixed maturity securities  we consider our intent to sell a security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before the anticipated recovery as part of the process of evaluating whether a security s unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
we assess whether the amortized cost basis of a fixed maturity security will be recovered by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the current book value 
any shortfalls of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized cost basis is considered the credit loss portion of other than temporary impairment otti losses and is recognized in earnings 
all non credit losses are recognized as changes in otti losses within other comprehensive income oci 

table of contents for equity securities  in general  the company focuses its attention on those securities with a fair value less than of their cost for six or more consecutive months 
if warranted as the result of conditions relating to a particular security  the company will focus on a significant decline in fair value regardless of the time period involved 
factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  the current fair value as compared to cost of the security  the length of time the investment has been below cost and by how much the investment is below cost 
if an equity security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  the cost is written down to fair value with the loss recognized in earnings 
for equity securities  the company also considers its intent to hold securities as part of the process of evaluating whether a decline in fair value represents an other than temporary decline in value 
for fixed maturity securities  the company considers its intent to sell a security and whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell a security before the anticipated recovery as part of the process of evaluating whether a security s unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
the company s ability to hold such securities is supported by sufficient cash flow from its operations and from maturities within its investment portfolio in order to meet its claims payment and other disbursement obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring  changing information and market conditions 
the day to day management of our investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers 
while these investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon a change in the market and other factors described above 
investment managers are required to notify management of rating agency downgrades of securities in their portfolios as well as any potential investment valuation issues at the end of each quarter 
investment managers are also required to notify management  and receive approval  prior to the execution of a transaction or series of related transactions that may result in a realized loss above a certain threshold 
additionally  management monitors the execution of a transaction or series of related transactions that may result in any realized loss up until a certain period beyond the close of a quarterly accounting period 
accounting for lloyd s results we record syndicate s assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses under us gaap 
additional information regarding our accounting for lloyd s results can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated and segment results of operations for the years ended december   and our financial results are presented on the basis of us gaap 
however  in presenting our financial results  we discuss our performance with reference to operating earnings  book value per share  underwriting profit or loss  and the combined ratio  all of which are non gaap financial measures of performance and or underwriting profitability 
operating earnings is calculated as net income less after tax net realized gains losses and net otti losses recognized in earnings 
book value per share is calculated by dividing stockholders equity by the number of outstanding shares at any period end 
underwriting profit or loss is calculated from net earned premiums  less the sum of net losses and lae  commission expenses  other operating expenses and other income expense 
the combined ratio is derived by dividing the sum of net losses and lae  commission expenses  other operating expenses and other income expense by net earned premiums 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit and greater indicates an underwriting loss 
we consider such measures  which may be defined differently by other companies  to be important in the understanding of our overall results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business

the remaining million of emergence was specific to our small lawyers and miscellaneous professional liability coverages 
an increase in our rrp accrual of million 
this accrual was driven by the recognition of the effect of a shift in our marine reinsurance protections to an excess of loss program from a quota share program 
as a result of this shift and the increased frequency of severity losses in recent periods  a greater portion of our ibnr was attributable to marine and energy losses that are or will be ceded to our marine excess of loss reinsurance program and such cession will trigger additional reinstatement premiums

the insurance companies and lloyd s professional liability division overall experienced approximately a decrease in average renewal premium rates for the year ended december  compared to the average premium rate increases or decreases as noted above for the marine  property casualty and professional liability businesses are calculated primarily by comparing premium amounts on policies that have renewed 
the premiums are adjusted for changes in exposures and sometimes represent an aggregation of several lines of business 
the rate change calculations provide an indicated pricing trend and are not meant to be a precise analysis of the numerous factors that affect premium rates or the adequacy of such rates to cover all underwriting costs and generate an underwriting profit 
the calculation can also be affected quarter by quarter depending on the particular policies and the number of policies that renew during that period 
due to market conditions  these rate changes may or may not apply to new business that generally would be more competitively priced compared to renewal business 
the calculation does not reflect the rate on business that we are unwilling or unable to renew due to loss experience or competition 
ceded written premiums in the ordinary course of business  we reinsure certain insurance risks with unaffiliated insurance companies for the purpose of limiting our maximum loss exposure  protecting against catastrophic losses and maintaining desired ratios of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
the relationship of ceded to gross written premium varies based upon the types of business written and whether the business is written by the insurance companies or the lloyd s operations 
our reinsurance program includes contracts for proportional reinsurance  per risk and whole account excess of loss reinsurance for both property and casualty risks and property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 
in recent years we have increased our utilization of excess of loss reinsurance for marine  property and certain casualty risks 
our excess of loss reinsurance contracts generally provide for a specific amount of coverage in excess of an attachment point and sometimes provides for reinstatement of the coverage to the extent the limit has been exhausted for payment of additional premium referred to as reinsurance reinstatement premiums or rrps 
the number of reinsurance reinstatements available varies by contract 
we record an estimate of the expected rrps for losses ceded to excess of loss agreements where this feature applies 
we incurred million  million  and million of rrps for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the million in rrps recorded in includes million from several large losses on our marine business  including the grounding of the cruise ship costa concordia off the coast of italy as well as million in connection with our loss on superstorm sandy 
the million in rrps recorded in are due to the large energy losses from our navtech business and the accrual for large losses from our marine business reflective of our shift to excess of loss reinsurance protection 
the million in rrps recorded in is largely attributable to the deepwater and west atlas losses

the marine business had million of net reserve redundancies  which were primarily driven by an ibnr adjustment of million to reflect the actual emergence of claims for underwriting year uy  which was more favorable than the expected emergence 
case reserve releases of million due to the favorable settlement of several large losses  and a favorable ibnr adjustment of million attributable to changes in our assumptions for salvage and subrogation from our short tail marine lines that was based on our observation of a consistent and persistent historical pattern of favorable savings attributable to salvage and subrogation 
the marine reserve redundancies were partially offset by net reserve deficiencies of million from the small lawyer and accountants lines within our professional liability business 
this deficiency was primarily driven by ibnr increases of million made to recognize the severity impact of several large losses that caused the actual claims emergence for these lines to exceed the expected emergence pattern 
we also incurred net reserve deficiencies of million within our property casualty segment  which were primarily attributable to two large hemophiliac claims from uy arising from our a h business

asbestos liability our exposure to asbestos liability principally stems from marine liability insurance written on an occurrence basis during the mid s 
in general  our participation on such risks is in the excess layers  which requires the underlying coverage to be exhausted prior to coverage being triggered in our layer 
in many instances we are one of many insurers who participate in the defense and ultimate settlement of these claims  and we are generally a minor participant in the overall insurance coverage and settlement 
the reserves for asbestos exposures as of december  are for i one large settled claim for excess insurance policy limits exposed to a class action suit against an insured involved in the manufacturing or distribution of asbestos products being paid over several years two other large settled claims were fully paid in  ii other insureds not directly involved in the manufacturing or distribution of asbestos products  but that have more than incidental asbestos exposure for their purchase or use of products that contained asbestos  and iii attritional asbestos claims that could be expected to occur over time 
substantially all of our asbestos liability reserves are included in our marine loss reserves 
there can be no assurances that material loss development may not arise in the future from existing asbestos claims or new claims given the evolving and complex legal environment that may directly impact the outcome of the asbestos exposures of our insureds

the decrease in commission expense for the year ended december  compared to the same period in can be attributed to changes in the mix of business and to a lesser extent an increase in the ceding commission on the new quota share program for our offshore energy business  partially offset by additional rrps in in connection with loss events from our marine business 
the slight decrease in the commission expense ratio for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in can be attributed to the impact of rrps recorded in  which reduced net earned premiums and in turn increased the commission expense ratio in other operating expenses other operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in primarily due to continued investments in new underwriting teams closely aligned with business growth and an increase in incentive compensation  which is largely impacted by a reversal of stock grants expense recorded for related to performance based awards that were not expected to vest  and to a lesser extent the issuance of additional performance and non performance restricted stock grants in refer to note  stock option plans  stock grants  stock appreciation rights and employee stock purchase plan  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our expense for restricted stock grants

segment information we classify our business into two underwriting segments consisting of the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations  which are separately managed  and a corporate segment 
segment data for each of the two underwriting segments include allocations of the operating expenses of the wholly owned underwriting management companies and the navigator s group  inc s the parent company s operating expenses and related income tax amounts

we evaluate the performance of each segment based on its underwriting and gaap results 
the underwriting results of the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations are measured by taking into account net earned premium  net loss and lae  commission expenses  other operating expenses and other income expense 
each segment also maintains its own investments  on which it earns income and realizes capital gains or losses 
our underwriting performance is evaluated separately from the performance of our investment portfolios

capital resources we monitor our capital adequacy to support our business on a regular basis 
the future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies

the new credit facility amended and restated a million letter of credit facility entered into by the parties on march  the credit facility  which is denominated in us dollars  is utilized to fund our participation in syndicate through letters of credit for the and underwriting years  as well as open prior years 
the letters of credit issued under the facility are denominated in british pounds and their aggregate face amount will fluctuate based on exchange rates 
if any letters of credit remain outstanding under the facility after december   we would be required to post additional collateral to secure the remaining letters of credit 
as of december   letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of million were outstanding under the credit facility and we have million of cash collateral posted 

table of contents this credit facility contains customary covenants for facilities of this type  including restrictions on indebtedness and liens  limitations on mergers  dividends and the sale of assets  and requirements as to maintaining certain consolidated tangible net worth  statutory surplus and other financial ratios 
the credit facility also provides for customary events of default  including failure to pay principal  interest or fees when due  failure to comply with covenants  any representation or warranty made by the company being false in any material respect  default under certain other indebtedness  certain insolvency or receivership events affecting the company and its subsidiaries  the occurrence of certain material judgments  or a change in control of the company 
the letter of credit facility is secured by a pledge of the stock of certain insurance subsidiaries of the company 
to the extent the aggregate face amount issued under the credit facility exceeds the commitment amount  we are required to post collateral with the lead bank of the consortium 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december  the applicable margin and applicable fee rate payable under the credit facility are based on a tiered schedule that is based on the company s then current ratings issued by s p and moody s with respect to the company s senior notes without third party credit enhancement  and the amount of the company s own collateral utilized to fund its participation in syndicate time lags do occur in the normal course of business between the time gross loss reserves are paid by the company and the time such gross paid losses are billed and collected from reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverable amounts related to gross loss reserves as of december  are anticipated to be billed and collected over the next several years as the gross loss reserves are paid by the company 
generally  for pro rata or quota share reinsurers  we issue quarterly settlement statements for premiums less commissions and paid loss activity  which are expected to be settled within days 
we have the ability to issue cash calls requiring such reinsurers to pay losses whenever paid loss activity for a claim ceded to a particular reinsurance treaty exceeds a predetermined amount generally million to million as set forth in the pro rata treaty 
for the insurance companies  cash calls must generally be paid within calendar days 
there is generally no specific settlement period for the lloyd s operations cash call provisions  but such billings have historically on average been paid within calendar days 
generally  for excess of loss reinsurers we pay quarterly deposit premiums based on the estimated subject premiums over the contract period usually one year that are subsequently adjusted based on actual premiums determined after the expiration of the applicable reinsurance treaty 
paid losses subject to excess of loss recoveries are generally billed as they occur and are usually settled by reinsurers within calendar days for the insurance companies and business days for the lloyd s operations 
we sometimes withhold funds from reinsurers and may apply ceded loss billings against such funds in accordance with the applicable reinsurance agreements 
liquidity consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to approximately million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow from operations was due to an increase in claims payments  partially offset by improved collections on reinsurance recoverables as well as premiums receivables 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the same period in and net cash used in investing activities of million for the same period in fluctuations in cash provided by  or used in  investing activities is primarily due to the ongoing management of our investment portfolio 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and the significant reduction in the use of cash by financing activities is primarily related to repurchases of the parent company s common stock under our share repurchase program which expired on december  and was not renewed 
we believe that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to us may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
we believe that we have adequately managed our cash flow requirements related to reinsurance recoveries from their positive cash flows and the use of available short term funds when applicable 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to adequately manage such recoveries in the future or that collection disputes or reinsurer insolvencies will not arise that could materially increase the collection time lags or result in recoverable write offs causing additional incurred losses and liquidity constraints to the company 
the payment of gross claims and related collections from reinsurers with respect to large losses could significantly impact our liquidity needs 
however  we expect to collect our paid reinsurance recoverables generally under the terms described above

the fair value of the company s investment portfolio may fluctuate significantly in response to various factors such as changes in interest rates  investment quality ratings  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and credit spreads 
the company does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that it will have to sell debt securities in unrealized loss positions that are not other than temporarily impaired before recovery 
for structured securities  default probability and severity assumptions differ based on property type  vintage and the stress of the collateral 
we do not intend to sell any of these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis 
for equity securities  the company also considers its intent to hold securities as part of the process of evaluating whether a decline in fair value represents an other than temporary decline in value 
the company may realize investment losses to the extent its liquidity needs require the disposition of fixed maturity securities in unfavorable interest rate  liquidity or credit spread environments 
significant changes in the factors the company considers when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements

they do  however  impact our investment portfolio

table of contents we analyze the unrealized losses quarterly to determine if any are other than temporary 
the above unrealized losses have been determined to be temporary based on our policies 
in the above table the gross unrealized loss for the greater than months category consists primarily of residential mortgage backed securities 
residential mortgage backed securities are a type of fixed income security in which residential mortgage loans are sold into a trust or special purpose vehicle  thereby securitizing the cash flows of the mortgage loans 
to determine whether the unrealized loss on structured securities is other than temporary  we analyze the projections provided by our investment managers with respect to an expected principal loss under a range of scenarios and utilize the most likely outcomes 
the analysis relies on actual collateral performance measures such as default rate  prepayment rate and loss severity 
these assumptions are applied throughout the remaining term of the deal  incorporating the transaction structure and priority of payments  to generate loss adjusted cash flows 
results of the analysis will indicate whether the security is expected ultimately to incur a loss or whether there is a material impact on yield due to either a projected loss or a change in cash flow timing 
a break even default rate is also calculated 
a comparison of the break even default rate to the actual default rate provides an indication of the level of cushion or coverage to the first dollar principal loss 
the analysis applies the stated assumptions throughout the remaining term of the transaction to forecast cash flows  which are then applied through the transaction structure to determine whether there is a loss to the security 
for securities in which a tranche loss is present  and the net present value of loss adjusted cash flows is less than book value  an impairment is recognized 
the output data also includes a number of additional metrics such as average life remaining  original and current credit support  over day delinquency and security rating 
prepayment assumptions associated with the mortgage backed and asset backed securities are reviewed on a periodic basis 
when changes in prepayment assumptions are deemed necessary as the result of actual prepayments differing from anticipated prepayments  securities are revalued based upon the new prepayment assumptions utilizing the retrospective accounting method 
as of december  and  the largest single unrealized loss by a non government backed issuer in the investment portfolio was million and million  respectively

the significant inputs used to measure the amount of credit loss recognized in earnings were actual delinquency rates  default probability assumptions  severity assumptions and prepayment assumptions 
projected losses are a function of both loss severity and probability of default 
default probability and severity assumptions differ based on property type  vintage and the stress of the collateral 
we do not intend to sell any of these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we are exposed to potential loss to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures have been managed through december  our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading and speculation 
the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december  was billion of which was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
we do not have any commodity risk exposure 
for fixed maturity securities  short term liquidity needs and the potential liquidity needs of the business are key factors in managing the portfolio 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through investment transactions 
there were no significant changes regarding the investment portfolio in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december  we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
the primary market risk to our market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a and basis points change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities will decrease 
conversely  as interest rates fall  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities will increase 
for invested assets  modified duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
duration on tax exempt securities is adjusted for the fact that the prices on such securities are less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis using holdings as of december  
table of contents the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate  parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our portfolio as of december  interest rate shift in basis points in thousands december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value equity price risk our portfolio of equity securities currently valued at million  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
our us equity portfolio is benchmarked to the s p index and changes in that index may approximate the impact on our portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our lloyd s operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily related to foreign denominated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities foreign funds  premiums receivable  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as well as reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the principal currencies creating foreign currency exchange risk for the lloyd s operations are the british pound  the euro and the canadian dollar 
the lloyd s operations manages its foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through asset liability matching 
based on the primary foreign denominated balances within the lloyd s operations as of december   an assumed  and negative currency movement would result in changes as follows december  negative currency movement of in millions usd equivalent cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value premiums receivable reinsurance recoverables on paid  unpaid losses and lae reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses
