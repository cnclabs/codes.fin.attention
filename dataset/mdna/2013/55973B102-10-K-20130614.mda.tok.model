business overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration for and the exploitation  acquisition  development and production of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids resources in the united states and canada 
we are presently active in three of the most prolific unconventional shale resource plays in north america  specifically  the marcellus shale in west virginia and ohio  the utica shale in southeastern ohio and western west virginia  and the williston basin bakken shale in north dakota and saskatchewan  canada 
our oil and natural gas reserves and operations are primarily concentrated in west virginia  ohio  north dakota  saskatchewan  kentucky and texas 
we are also engaged in midstream and oil field services operations  primarily in west virginia  ohio and texas 
our principal business strategy is to a exploit our substantial inventory of lower risk  liquids weighted drilling locations  b acquire and develop long lived proved reserves and undeveloped leases with significant exploitation and development opportunities primarily located in close proximity to our existing core areas of operation and c selectively monetize our assets at opportune times and attractive prices 
since the current management team assumed leadership of the company in may and completely refocused our business strategy  we have substantially increased our assets and production base through a combination of acquisitions  joint ventures and ongoing development drilling efforts 
we believe the increased scale in all our core resource plays allows for ongoing cost recovery and production efficiencies as we exploit and monetize our asset base 
we are focused on the further development and exploitation of our asset base  selective bolt on acquisitions of additional operated properties in our core operating regions  expansion of our midstream operations and  ultimately  the possible monetization of our assets 
in april  we monetized our core properties in the oil window of the eagle ford shale in gonzales and lavaca counties in south texas through a sale of these properties to an affiliate of penn virginia corporation  or penn virginia  for a total purchase price of million  paid to us in the form of million in cash before customary purchase price adjustments and million in penn virginia common stock valued  for purposes of the purchase price calculation  at a price of per share 
we refer to this sale as our sale of the eagle ford properties or our eagle ford properties sale 
as a result of our sale of the eagle ford properties  we are now strategically focused on our marcellus shale  utica shale and williston basin bakken shale plays 
we have reallocated our capital expenditure budget of million previously allocated to the eagle ford shale to our other shale plays  resulting in a capital expenditure budget of million for the marcellus shale and utica shale plays and million for the williston basin bakken shale play  for a total upstream capital expenditure budget of million 
we are exploring the possible monetization in or of all or part of our midstream operations 
we have also identified a number of non core properties  which we believe represent approximately million to million in aggregate value  for possible divestiture in and our midstream operations are conducted through our majority owned subsidiary  eureka hunter holdings  llc  or eureka holdings 
eureka holdings conducts its operations primarily through the following two subsidiaries i eureka hunter pipeline  llc  or eureka pipeline  which owns and operates a gas gathering system in west virginia and ohio  referred to as our eureka hunter gas gathering system  and ii transtex hunter  llc  or transtex hunter  which is engaged primarily in the business of treating natural gas at the wellhead for third party producers in texas and other states 
we have obtained financing for our midstream operations through an equity purchase commitment from an unaffiliated third party which also gives us the right to make capital contributions in conjunction with or alongside the capital contributions from the third party and two separate credit facilities on a non recourse basis to magnum hunter 
we also conduct oil field services operations through our wholly owned subsidiary  alpha hunter drilling  llc  or alpha hunter drilling  which owns and operates five drilling rigs that are used primarily for vertical section top hole air drilling in the appalachian basin 
alpha hunter drilling recently took delivery of a new drilling rig that can also drill the horizontal sections of wells in the shale plays where we are active 

table of contents summary of principal upstream properties appalachian basin as of may   our appalachian basin properties included approximately  gross  net acres  located primarily in the marcellus shale  utica shale and southern appalachian basin 
at december   proved reserves attributable to our appalachian basin properties were mmboe on an sec basis  of which were oil and liquids and were classified as proved developed producing  and mmboe on a nymex basis 
as of may   our appalachian basin properties included approximately  gross  net productive wells  of which we operated approximately 
williston basin as of may   our williston basin properties included approximately  gross  net acres 
as of december   proved reserves attributable to our williston basin properties were mmboe on an sec basis  of which were oil and natural gas liquids and were classified as proved developed producing  and mmboe on an nymex basis 
as of may   our williston basin properties included approximately gross net productive wells  of which we operated approximately 
summary of midstream operations eureka pipeline as of may   our eureka hunter gas gathering system included approximately miles of completed gathering pipeline  located in northwestern west virginia and crossing into ohio  in the marcellus shale and utica shale 
we continue to develop this gathering system 
transtex hunter transtex hunter is primarily engaged in the business of treating natural gas at the wellhead for third party producers  with a focus on associated natural gas produced from various oil shale plays 
summary of oil field services operations as of may   our wholly owned subsidiary  alpha hunter drilling  owned and operated four schramm txd drilling rigs and one new schramm txd drilling rig 
the drilling rigs are used for the company s appalachian basin operations and to provide drilling services to third parties 
these drilling rigs primarily drill the top holes of wells in preparation for larger drilling rigs  which drill the horizontal sections of the wells 

table of contents highlights and outlook our activities in included several notable acquisitions  including the acquisitions of the acquired baytex assets and the acquired samson assets  the utica acreage acquisition and the virco acquisition 
in addition  in  we significantly increased our drilling capital expenditure program to approximately million  which was focused primarily on oil and liquids rich natural gas projects due to the decline in natural gas prices 
we have this flexibility because a substantial portion of our natural gas acreage is held by production 
as a result of these acquisitions and increased capital expenditures and our shift in strategy to a more liquids focus our production mix consisted of approximately oil and liquids in the fourth quarter of compared to oil and liquids in the first quarter of our production increased from  average boepd for to  average boepd for as a result of acquisitions and the increased capital expenditures 
our revenues increased commensurately at a rate of in  compared with in april  we sold our core eagle ford shale properties to an affiliate of penn virginia for approximately million  including million in cash before customary purchase price adjustments and million in penn virginia common stock 
as a result  our strategic focus is now on the liquids rich portions of the marcellus and utica shales in appalachia and oil production in the bakken shale in north dakota and saskatchewan 
our upstream capital budget of million is allocated approximately million for each of the appalachian basin and williston basin divisions 
in the appalachian basin area  we intend to drill gross net marcellus shale wells in  with the vast majority of these wells expected to come on line in the second half of our focus in the marcellus shale will be primarily in northwest west virginia in tyler and wetzel counties and in southeastern ohio in monroe county 
we commenced drilling activity in the utica shale in april  and  subject to our drilling results in  we expect to significantly expand our drilling efforts in the play in we expect to have drilling results from our initial utica shale well in august or september we plan to drill and complete three additional horizontal wells in the utica shale in we currently expect to process our liquids rich gas production from the marcellus shale and utica shale at the mobley processing plant or other anticipated closer gas processing facilities using our gathering capacity on our eureka hunter gas gathering system 
in the williston basin area  we plan to drill approximately gross net wells in our focus will be in northwest divide county  north dakota 
we believe this area has the potential for the highest rate of return in our current inventory of properties in the williston basin 
we are focusing our efforts primarily on developing the middle bakken zone in this area 
currently  we have booked only a relatively small amount of proved reserves in this area 
we have targeted additional strategic divestitures to further strengthen our capital position and focus on our three core shale plays 
we are exploring the monetization in or of the eureka hunter gas gathering system 
we have also identified non core properties in our portfolio  which we believe represent approximately million to million in aggregate value  for possible divestiture in and these potential divestitures would allow us to significantly expand our activities in our core shale areas in the marcellus  utica and bakken  while at the same time substantially improving our financial position and balance sheet 
the net proceeds from our eagle ford properties sale and expected net proceeds in and from sales of non strategic properties will lessen the impact of our reduced ability to access the capital markets using short form registration statements or at the market offerings as a result of this annual report not having been filed within  and our form q for the quarter ended march  to be filed after  the time frames permitted by the sec 
see risk factors our failure to timely file certain periodic reports with the sec limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital 
we also expect our credit facilities to furnish us with additional liquidity  although our ability to access such facilities could be curtailed or eliminated if i we fail to file such form q by the lenders extended deadline of july  or within any additional extended time period our lenders may in the future provide us or ii an uncured cross default under such facilities results from any uncured event of default under the indenture relating to our senior notes stemming from our late sec filings 
see risk factors our existing senior notes indenture defaults restrict our ability to utilize certain exceptions to the restrictive covenants contained therein and  under certain circumstances  may result in the acceleration of the senior notes issued under our indenture and the outstanding debt under our credit facilities  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
internal controls the company management  including the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and chief accounting officer  with the assistance of outside consultants  has conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting as of december  based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
management excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting of virco  which was acquired on november  and of transtex hunter  the assets of which were initially acquired on april  the subsidiaries excluded from management assessment of internal controls over financial reporting made up combined total assets of approximately percent and percent of total revenue of the corresponding consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december  based on its assessment  management has concluded that  as of december   the company internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weaknesses described in item a of this annual report 
the company believes that such weaknesses are attributable primarily to its recent rapid growth 
management is actively addressing these issues and has developed a detailed remediation plan for this purpose 
partly as a result of these weaknesses  the company was unable to file this annual report and its form q for the quarter ended march  by the required sec filing deadlines 
the company expects to file its form q for the quarter ended march  within days of the filing of this annual report  but not later than july  in addition  as previously publicly disclosed  the company did not design effective controls over share based compensation expense  which is recorded in the company general and administrative expenses 
specifically  the company did not design effective controls related to the review of supporting details  including the accuracy of the vesting inputs and calculations and the journal entries for share based compensation expenses 
this control deficiency resulted in a misstatement of the company general and administrative expense and share based compensation related disclosures for the three and six month periods ended june  and resulted in the restatement of the financial statements for such fiscal periods 
the board of directors  the audit committee of the board and senior management of the company consider it essential that they provide the appropriate tone at the top to assure the company achieves effective and comprehensive internal controls over financial reporting 
to further such objective  the board of directors  the audit committee and senior management have adopted a proactive hands on approach to address the company internal control deficiencies  including the development of a detailed remediation plan 
as part of this plan  the company has hired  and will continue to dedicate substantial resources to hire  additional accounting personnel with greater expertise  has engaged outside consultants and a big four accounting firm to assist it and is investing in new information systems 
see item a controls and procedures in this annual report for a more detailed description of the material weaknesses in the company internal controls identified by management and the remediation measures being taken by the company to address these weaknesses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the us the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under us gaap 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas activities successful efforts accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to unique rules 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
the significant principles for this method are geological and geophysical evaluation costs are expensed as incurred 
dry holes for exploratory wells are expensed  and dry holes for developmental wells are capitalized 
capitalized costs relating to proved oil and gas properties  including wells and related equipment and facilities  are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net capitalized costs relating to proved properties  then we recognize an impairment charge to proved property impairment expense equal to the difference between the net capitalized costs relating to proved properties and their estimated fair values based on the present value of the related future net cash flows 
capitalized costs relating to unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment 
the company impairs an unproved lease if it becomes probable that its carrying value will not be recovered based on management outlooks 
by their nature  unproved properties impairment assessments are judgmental unless active exploration of the project is underway or clear intent exists to allow the underlying leaseholds to expire before exploring them for proved reserves 
if impairment indicators exist  inquiries become more critical and demanding 
factors that affect the impairment assessments include but may not be limited to results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales  expirations or extensions of all or a portion of the projects  and capital budgeting considerations 
for properties assessed  if the property is surrendered or the lease expires without identifying proved reserves  the cost of the property is recognized as a charge to exploration and abandonment expense 

table of contents proved reserves for the year ended december   we engaged cawley  gillespie associates  inc  independent petroleum engineers  to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves associated with our oil and gas properties in accordance with guidelines established by the sec  including the revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
we adopted these revisions effective december  estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the un weighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december  for oil and natural gas in accordance with the sec s reserve rules 
the average price used for oil was and for natural gas was 
see also item business and item properties proved reserves and note other information to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves 
derivative instruments and commodity derivative activities marked to market at fair value  derivative contracts are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled gain loss on derivative contracts  net 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
we record both realized and unrealized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses result from changes in the fair market value of the derivative contracts from period to period  and represent non cash gains or losses 
changes in commodity prices could have a significant effect on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use third party valuations providers to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in gain loss on derivative contracts on our consolidated statements of operations 
changes in the derivative s fair value are currently recognized in the statement of operations unless specific commodity derivative hedge accounting criteria are met and such strategies are designated 
we continue not to designate our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
the following table summarizes the net gain loss on our derivative contracts for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  in thousands realized gain loss unrealized gain loss net gain loss a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value of the derivative liabilities recorded on our balance sheet and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
a hypothetical decrease in the nymex floating prices would have a resulted in a million increase in the december  fair value of the derivative liabilities recorded on our balance sheet and would have increased the gain on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations by the corresponding amount 

table of contents the company also has preferred stock derivative liabilities resulting from certain conversion features  redemption options  and other features of the series a convertible preferred units of eureka hunter holdings  llc  and a convertible security embedded derivative asset primarily due to the conversion feature of the promissory note received by us as partial consideration for the sale of hunter disposal  llc 
see note summary of significant accounting policies  note fair value of financial instruments  note financial instruments and derivatives  and note shareholders equity  for more information on our derivative instruments 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
our liability for asset retirement obligations was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note asset retirement obligations to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
share based compensation the company estimates the fair value of share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to employee stock purchase plans  on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods 
awards that vest only upon achievement of performance criteria are recorded only when achievement of the performance criteria is considered probable 
we estimate the fair value of each share based award using the black scholes option pricing model or a lattice model 
these models are highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management 
the estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock based awards  the estimated volatility of our stock price  and the assessment of whether the achievement of performance criteria is probable 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million  and million in non cash stock compensation  respectively 
see note share based compensation to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
impairment and disposition of long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
asc requires that the company s long lived assets  including its proved oil and gas properties  be assessed for potential impairment in their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred 
an impairment charge to current operations is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value 
any such impairment is recognized based on the differences in the carrying value and estimated fair value of the impaired asset 
the guidance provides for future revenue from the company s oil and gas production to be estimated based upon prices at which management reasonably estimates such products will be sold 
these estimates of future product prices may differ from current market prices of oil and gas 
any downward revisions to management s estimates of future production or product prices could result in an impairment of the company s proved oil and gas properties in subsequent periods 
the long lived assets of the company which are subject to evaluation consist primarily of oil and gas properties 
impairment reviews are performed quarterly by management 
the company recognized a non cash  pre tax charge against earnings related to the impairment of proved property of approximately million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
capitalized costs relating to unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment 
the company impairs an unproved lease if it becomes probable that its carrying value will not be recovered based on management outlooks 
during  the company exploration and abandonment expense was primarily attributable to million in leasehold impairments and million in leasehold abandonment expense  which included million and million associated with the company unproved properties in the williston basin and appalachian basin 
the significant components of the company leasehold abandonment expense included unproved acreage abandonments of  and  in the appalachian basin and eagle ford shale areas  respectively  and million of exploration costs 

table of contents by their nature  unproved properties impairment assessments are judgmental unless active exploration of the project is underway or clear intent exists to allow the underlying leaseholds to expire before exploring them for proved reserves 
if impairment indicators exist  inquiries become more critical and demanding 
factors that affect the impairment assessments include but may not be limited to results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales  expirations or extensions of all or a portion of the projects  and capital budgeting considerations 
for properties assessed  if the property is surrendered or the lease expires without identifying proved reserves  the cost of the property is recognized as a charge to exploration and abandonment expense 
the company recognized a non cash  pre tax charge against earnings related to expirations of leaseholds for properties that we chose not to develop of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
intangible assets consist primarily of the fair value of the acquired gas treating agreements and customer relationships in the transtex gas services  lp assets acquisition 
the intangible assets were valued at fair value using a discounted cash flow model with a discount rate of 
such assets are being amortized over the weighted average term of years 
the customer relationships are being amortized with a year life 
the company assesses the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets by testing for impairment annually on april  or whenever interim impairment indicators arise 
amortizable intangible assets are required to be evaluated at least annually for impairment 
other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
at december   our other intangible assets were not impaired 
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil and liquids  natural gas  petroleum products  and other items are recognized when earned 
revenues are considered earned when the products are delivered  which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  prices are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from the production of crude oil and natural gas properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period 
any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes  based on our net working interest  which are deemed to be non recoverable through remaining production  are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are not significant 
revenues from field servicing activities are recognized at the time the services are provided and earned as provided in the various contract agreements 
gas gathering revenues are recognized at the time the natural gas is delivered at the destination point 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc  under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using the enacted statutory tax rates in effect at year end 
the effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
uncertain income tax positions under accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes asc  a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management assessment is that the position is more likely than not ie  a likelihood greater than percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the term tax position in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 
no material uncertain tax positions existed at december  effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the us economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the cost of labor or supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher prices 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth summary information regarding oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues  production  average product prices and average production costs and expenses for the last three fiscal years

table of contents years ended december  and oil and gas production 
production increased by  or  mboe  to  mboe for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our average daily production was  boepd during  representing an overall increase of  or  boepd compared to  boepd for the increase in production in compared to is primarily attributable to acquisitions as well as organic growth through the company s expanded drilling program 
production for  on a boe basis  was oil and ngls and natural gas compared to oil and ngls and natural gas for the change was attributable to increased focus on the development of oil production in the eagle ford shale and williston basin regions 
us upstream segment 
in the us upstream production operating segment  production increased  from  mboe to  mboe for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  production for on a boe basis was oil and ngls and natural gas compared to oil and ngls and natural gas for our average daily production increased from  boepd  to  boepd during compared to this increase in production for the us upstream segment in compared to is primarily attributable to the acquired baytex assets and acquired eagle assets as well as organic growth through the company s expanded drilling program 
canadian upstream segment 
production increased in the canadian upstream operating segment by  or mboe  to mboe for the year ended december  from mboe for the year ended december  production from the canadian segment comprised oil and ngls and natural gas on a boe basis in compared to oil and ngls and natural gas on a boe basis in the canadian operating segment initiated production as part of magnum hunter in  due to the nuloch acquisition completed in the first half of oil and gas sales 
oil and gas sales increased  or million  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in oil and gas sales principally resulted from increases in our oil and natural gas production as a result of acquisitions and expanded drilling completed throughout the year in our unconventional resource plays 
the average price we received for our production decreased from per boe to per boe  or primarily due to lower natural gas prices 
the million increase in revenues comprised an increase of approximately million attributable to increased production volumes of  mboe  partially offset by a decrease of million due to a decrease in price of per boe produced 
the prices we receive for our products are generally tied to commodity index prices 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts in an attempt to offset some of the variability in prices see the discussion of commodity derivative activities below 
midstream operations 
revenue from the midstream operations segment which  in  consisted of both the eureka pipeline and transtex hunter operations increased by million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues resulted from the acquisition of the transtex gas services assets in april  as well as increased volume of natural gas product gathered by our pipeline gathering system  as eureka pipeline gathered approximately million mmbtu in compared with approximately million mmbtu in transtex hunter added million of revenue related primarily to treating natural gas at the wellhead for third party producers in texas and other states 
oil field services 
drilling services revenue increased by  or million  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  revenues from continuous operations in oilfield services comprised drilling services 
other income 
other revenues  consisting primarily of gas regulated  retail gas billing revenues from the appalachian region of the us upstream segment  increased by  for the year ended december  lease operating expense 
our lease operating expenses  or loe  increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million per boe from million per boe for the year ended december  the increase in total loe is attributable to increased volume produced  which caused an increase in cost of million  reduced by lower cost per boe produced  which offset the effect of the increase in volume by million 
the decrease in overall loe per boe cost is due to the impact of the lower per boe cost of the new production brought online during through our ongoing drilling program in our unconventional resource plays 
severance taxes and marketing 
our severance taxes and marketing increased by million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in production taxes and marketing was due to the increase in oil and gas sales as explained above 
exploration and abandonments 
we record exploration costs  geological and geophysical  and unproved property impairments and leasehold expiration as exploration and abandonment expense 
we recorded million of exploration and abandonment expense for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during  the company exploration and abandonment expense was primarily attributable to million of leasehold abandonment expense  which included million and million associated with the company unproved properties in the williston and appalachian basins  respectively  and million of exploration costs 
the williston basin impairment is primarily due to the large acreage position 
table of contents we initially acquired and results to date in the area  which led us to focus on other areas  thereby letting certain acreage expire in that region 
leasehold abandonment expense also includes impairment charges of million related to unproved properties of million  million  and million in the company williston and appalachian basins and south texas  respectively  primarily due to declines in gas prices and downward adjustments to the economically recoverable resource potential 
the significant components of the company leasehold abandonment expense included unproved acreage abandonments of  and  in the appalachian basin and south texas areas  respectively  and million of exploration costs 
during the quarter ended march   the company recognized an additional million lease abandonment expense related to leases that expired on approximately acres in the williston basin region that we planned to renew as of december   but failed to renew as a result of logistical difficulties 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
we review for impairment our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting
