overview the fresh market is a high growth specialty retailer focused on creating an extraordinary food shopping experience for our customers 
since opening our first store in  we have offered high quality food products  with an emphasis on fresh  premium perishables and an uncompromising commitment to customer service 
we seek to provide an attractive  convenient shopping environment while offering our customers a compelling price value combination 
as of january   we operated stores in states  in the southeast  midwest  mid atlantic  northeast and west regions of the united states 
we believe several key differentiating elements of our business have enabled us to execute our strategy consistently and profitably across our expanding store base 
we believe that our differentiated shopping experience has helped us to expand our business primarily through favorable word of mouth publicity 
within our smaller box format  we focus on higher margin food categories and strive to deliver a more personal level of service and a more enjoyable shopping experience 
further  our smaller box format is adaptable to different retail sites and configurations and has facilitated our successful growth 
additionally  we believe our disciplined  comprehensive approach to planning and merchandising and the support we provide our stores allow us to deliver a consistent shopping experience and financial performance across our store base 
operating income for fiscal year increased million  to million  compared to million for the year ended january  net income for the year ended january  was million as compared to million for the year ended january  diluted earnings per share for the year ended january  was compared to diluted earnings per share of for the year ended january  outlook we intend to continue our profitable growth by expanding our store base  driving comparable store sales and increasing our operating margins 
consistent with our history of growth  we intend to open new stores in existing markets and penetrate new markets 
we view expansion of our store base as a core competency and have nearly quadrupled our store count since we opened new stores in fiscal and believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to increase our number of stores 
in addition  if attractive opportunities arise  we may use lease inducements to acquire leases as a way to expand our store base and penetrate new markets 
our results of operations have been  and may continue to be  affected by the timing and number of new store openings  because new stores generally have different performance profiles and greater variability in sales volumes than our mature stores  and because the overall revenue contributed by new stores may vary from period to period based on the relative timing of new store openings within each period 
we aim to increase our comparable store sales by generating growth in the number and size of customer transactions 
key elements of our strategy include increasing customer awareness  offering new and differentiated products and continuing to provide a distinctive in store experience 
we also intend to increase our operating margins through scale efficiencies  improved systems  continued cost discipline and enhancements to our merchandise offerings 
we expect store growth will permit us to benefit from economies of scale in sourcing products and will allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure for scale efficiencies 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on evolving consumer preferences and other trends currently shaping the food retail industry 
these trends include a growing emphasis on the customer shopping experience  an increasing consumer focus on healthy eating choices and fresh  quality offerings  including regionally and locally sourced products  an improving perception of private label product quality  and an increase in the average age of the us population which  driven by an aging baby boomer population which  we believe  tends to make a greater number of shopping trips and higher food at home spending per household than younger age groups 
we expect continued sales growth in fiscal the magnitude of expected growth could vary significantly due to overall economic and competitive conditions  and due to volatility in the supply and costs of commodities such as meat  cheese and produce 
the company expects that the development and maturation of new stores will also drive future sales growth 
we anticipate opening an additional to new stores by the end of  in addition to remodeling three to five stores during the same period 
how we assess the performance of our business in assessing our performance  we consider a variety of performance and financial measures 
the key measures that we assess to evaluate the performance of our business are set forth below sales our sales comprise gross sales net of coupons  commissions and discounts 
sales include sales from all of our stores 
the food retail industry and our sales are affected by general economic conditions and seasonality  as well as the other factors  discussed below  that affect our comparable store sales 
consumer purchases of specialty food products are particularly sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including economic conditions  the level of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
in addition  our business is seasonal and  as a result  our average weekly sales fluctuate during the year and are usually highest in the fourth quarter when customers make holiday purchases 
comparable store sales our practice is to include sales from a store in comparable store sales beginning on the first day of the sixteenth full month following the store s opening 
we believe that comparability is achieved approximately fifteen months after opening 
when a store that is included in comparable store sales is remodeled or relocated  we continue to consider sales from that store to be comparable store sales 
there may be variations in the way that our competitors calculate comparable or same store sales 
as a result  data in this form k regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors 
various factors may affect comparable store sales  including overall economic trends and conditions  including general price levels in the economy  consumer confidence  preferences  and buying trends  our competition  including competitor store openings or closings near our stores  our competitors expanding their offerings of premium perishable products  the pricing of our products  including the effects of inflation  deflation and our promotional activities which we evaluate and adjust in the ordinary course of our business  the number of customer transactions at our stores  our ability to provide an assortment of distinctive  high quality product offerings to generate new and repeat visits to our stores  the level of customer service that we provide in our stores  our in store merchandising related activities  our ability to source products efficiently  our opening of new stores in the vicinity of our existing stores  the number of stores we open  remodel or relocate in any period  and severe or unfavorable weather conditions 
as we continue to pursue our growth strategy  we expect that a significant percentage of our sales growth will continue to come from new stores not included in comparable store sales 
accordingly  comparable store sales is only one measure we use to assess our performance 
gross profit gross profit is equal to our sales minus our cost of goods sold 
gross margin rate measures gross profit as a percentage of our sales 
cost of goods sold is directly correlated with sales and includes the direct costs of purchased merchandise  distribution and supply chain costs  buying costs  store supplies and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  common area maintenance  real estate taxes  personal property taxes  insurance  licenses and utilities 
cost of goods sold is exclusive of depreciation  which is reported separately 
the components of our cost of goods sold may not be identical to those of our competitors 
as a result  data in this form k regarding our gross profit and gross margin rate may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors 
gross margin rate enhancements are driven by economies of scale resulting from expanding our store base  reduced shrinkage as a percentage of sales  and productivity gains through process and program improvements 
changes in the mix of products sold may also impact our gross margin rate 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include certain retail store and corporate costs  including compensation both cash and share based  pre opening expenses  and other corporate administrative costs 
share based compensation expenses include those incurred in connection with our initial public offering as well as those arising from grants made under our omnibus incentive compensation plan 
pre opening expenses are costs associated with the opening of new stores including costs associated with travel  recruiting  relocating and training personnel and other miscellaneous costs 
pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
labor and corporate administrative costs generally decrease as a percentage of sales as a result of an increase in our sales 
accordingly  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are usually higher in lower volume quarters and lower in higher volume quarters 
store level compensation costs are generally the largest component of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the components of our selling  general and administrative expenses may not be identical to those of our competitors 
as a result  data in this form k regarding our selling  general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods due to our continuing store growth 
income from operations income from operations consists of gross profit minus selling  general and administrative expenses  store closure and exit costs and depreciation 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable is accrued  and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our financial statements in the period that includes the enactment date 
change in fiscal year end and presentation of financial information on january  our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from a calendar year end of december  to a fiscal year end of the last sunday of january  commencing with fiscal in connection with the change of our fiscal year end  we had a thirty day transition period from january  to january   the audited results of which are reported below 
we changed our fiscal year end in order to offer more comparable quarterly and annual data to our investors 
as a specialty retailer focused on foods  our operations are more active during the periods surrounding holidays and can be subject to seasonal differences in the event that holiday periods fall within a particular fiscal period one year and a different fiscal period in a subsequent year 
by changing our fiscal year end  revenues  including the use of gift cards given as holiday gifts  in the months of december and january will now appear in the same fiscal quarter and fiscal year resulting in greater comparability of our period to period financial results regardless of whether most customer purchases are made at the end of december or the beginning of january 
in addition  the easter holiday and the time periods surrounding easter are significant shopping periods for us and the change in our fiscal year end means that these periods will always be in our first fiscal quarter rather than occurring variously from one year to the next in the first quarter or the second quarter 
we believe that this change in fiscal year end will provide investors with a more comparable quarterly and annual picture of our company s operations 
included in this report are our consolidated balance sheets as of january  and january   as well as consolidated statements of comprehensive income  stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended january   january   one month period ended january   and fiscal year ended december  as we did in the form k for the fiscal year end january   we have provided management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparing the year ended january  against the year ended december  we have also provided a comparison of the fiscal year ended january  against the unaudited fifty two week period ended january  the purpose of this presentation is to provide period to period comparisons that are consistent and enable greater comparability in the review of our operational and financial performance 
thus  this section is organized in the following order i year ended january  compared to the year ended january   ii year ended january  compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january   iii year ended january  compared to the year ended december   and iv one month audited transition period ended january  compared to the one month unaudited period ended january  non gaap adjusted financial results in addition to presenting our financial results in conformity with gaap within this form k  we are also presenting results for the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  and the year ended december  on an adjusted basis in order to exclude the impact of certain charges related to our initial public offering and the tax effect of converting from an s corporation to a c corporation in connection with our initial public offering 
specifically  results for the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  and for the year ended december  include share based compensation and related payroll tax expenses arising from the vesting of equity awards at the time of the initial public offering  as well as income tax charges incurred in order to establish beginning deferred tax balances arising from our conversion from an s corporation to a c corporation 
in addition  we did not incur federal corporate income tax for a portion of the unaudited fifty two week period ended january  and for a portion of the year ended december   due to our previous s corporation status 
our adjusted results exclude the impact of the charges related to our initial public offering and reflect a pro forma provision for corporate income taxes for the portion of during which we had s corporation status except in states in which s corporation status is not recognized 
except where the context otherwise requires  the use of the term adjusted or as adjusted with reference to the financial results discussed in this management s discussion and analysis refers to the adjusted results described in this paragraph 
these adjusted financial results are non gaap financial measures 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial results facilitates an understanding of our operations without the one time impact associated with the initial public offering and the prior s corporation tax treatment 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
for a reconciliation of adjusted results to gaap results and a discussion of why we use non gaap financial measures  see year ended january  compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  and year ended january  compared to the year ended december

year ended january  compared to the year ended january  sales sales increased  or million  to  million in the increase in sales for the year ended january  was attributable to sales from stores that were not open during the year ended january   increased sales from stores that were only open during a portion of the year ended january  and an overall increase in comparable store sales 
there were comparable stores and non comparable stores open at january  comparable store sales increased for the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january   as a result of a increase in the number of transactions and a increase in the average transaction size at our comparable stores 
average customer transaction size increased to approximately for the year ended january   from approximately for the year ended january  gross profit gross profit increased  or million  to million for the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january  the amount of the increase in gross profit attributable to increased sales was million and the amount of the increase in gross profit attributable to increased gross margin rate was million 
our cost of goods sold increased by million for the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january   which was primarily attributable to a million increase in merchandise product costs and a million increase in store occupancy costs 
gross margin rate increased basis points to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the increase in our gross margin rate was primarily attributable to increased merchandise margin  and to a lesser extent a decrease in our occupancy cost as a percentage of sales 
the increase in gross margin rate over the prior year was offset by our million initial recognition of gift card breakage income for the year ended january   which improved the fiscal merchandise rate by approximately basis points 
the lifo expense decreased  by approximately million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january   which provided a positive impact to the gross margin rate of approximately basis points as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of stores in operation and an increase in customer traffic during the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january   which led to higher overall store level compensation expenses and other costs to operate our stores 
with more stores in operation during the year ended january   our store salary and benefit expenses increased million and our other store operating expenses increased million  compared to the year ended january  there was also a million increase in our corporate administrative expenses for the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january   primarily attributable to employee compensation expenses due to an increase in headcount and additional expenses related to our share based compensation program 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  were or basis points higher than the selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to higher store level compensation costs and incremental expenses associated with the company share based compensation program incurred during the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january  income from operations for the year ended january   operating income increased million  to million from million for the year ended january  income from operations as a percentage of sales for the year ended january  increased basis points to from for the year ended january  the increase in our income from operations for the year ended january   compared to the year ended january   was primarily due to the growth in gross margin rate  which was partially offset by higher employee related expenses and depreciation expense 
the increase in income from operations was also partially offset by the cycling of the company million for the initial recognition of breakage on gift cards  which increased operating income by basis points as a percentage of sales for the year ended january  depreciation increased  or million  to million for the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january   which was principally attributable to the additional fixed assets related to the stores opened during the year ended january   and a full year of depreciation expense recorded on fixed assets related to stores opened during the year ended january  interest expense interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january   due primarily to reduced weighted average borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
income tax expense the effective income tax rate for the year ended january  was as compared to for the year ended january  the lower rate was due to higher permanent differences  primarily arising from increased enhanced charitable food contribution deductions 
net income net income increased  or million  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  net income as a percentage of sales for the year ended january  increased to from for the year ended january  year ended january  compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  sales sales increased  or million  to  million in the increase in sales for the year ended january  was attributable primarily to sales from stores that were not open for the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january   increased sales from stores that were only opened during a portion for the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  and an overall increase in comparable store sales 
there were comparable stores and non comparable stores open at january  our sales for the year ended january  includes million for the initial recognition of breakage on gift cards we previously issued and sold 
although we expect to recognize gift card breakage income in future periods  the amount we expect to recognize in future periods will be less than the initial breakage income we recognized for the year ended january  for example  our gift card breakage income for the fourth quarter of fiscal  when we began recognizing gift card breakage income  represented approximately million  while the cumulative adjustment for the initial recognition of gift card breakage represented million  for a total of approximately million in gift card breakage income for the year ended january  due to seasonality  we expect gift card breakage income to be significantly higher in the fourth quarter than in any other fiscal quarter 
gift card breakage income is excluded from the comparable store sales figures 
comparable store sales increased for the year ended january   as compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january   as a result of a increase in the number of transactions and a increase in the average transaction size at our comparable stores

gross margin rate increased basis points to for the year ended january  from for the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  the increase in our gross margin rate was attributable to increased merchandise margin as well as leverage in occupancy costs and supplies expense  offset by deleverage in lifo expense 
the merchandise margin rate improved basis points as a percentage of sales for the year ended january  related to our initial recognition of million in gift card breakage income 
the lifo expense increased to million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january   which negatively impacted the gross margin rate by approximately basis points as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended january   as compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of stores in operation and an increase in customer traffic during the year ended january   as compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january   which led to higher overall store level compensation expenses and other costs to operate our stores 
with more stores in operation during the year ended january   our salary and benefit expenses increased million and our other store operating expenses increased million  compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  these increases were offset by a decrease of million in our corporate administrative expenses for the year ended january   as compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  the decrease was primarily attributable to share based compensation expenses for corporate employees and related payroll tax expense of million associated with our initial public offering in and was partially offset by a million increase in corporate compensation expense  which was primarily attributable to increased headcount for the year ended january  compared to the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  excluding the ipo related share based compensation and payroll tax expense  selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended january  increased  or million  from million  as adjusted  for the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  as a percent of sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended january  were or basis points higher than the adjusted selling general and administrative expenses for the unaudited fifty two weeks ended january  selling  general and administrative expenses included higher corporate expenses  driven by approximately million in new expenses attributable to our public company status and approximately million in transaction expenses incurred in connection with our public offering of common stock in fiscal  which together adversely impacted selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately basis points during fiscal in addition to these higher corporate expenses  we also incurred incremental expenses opening new stores in fiscal  mostly offset by an improvement in store level and corporate compensation expense as a percentage of sales

gross profit gross profit increased  or million  to million for the year ended january   as compared to the amount of the increase in gross profit attributable to increased sales was million and the amount of the increase in gross profit attributable to increased gross margin rate was million 
our cost of goods sold increased by million for the year ended january   as compared to  which was primarily attributable to a million increase in merchandise product costs  million increase in store occupancy costs and a million increase in lifo expense 
gross margin rate increased basis points to for the year ended january  from for the increase in our gross margin rate was primarily attributable to increased merchandise margin as well as leverage in occupancy costs and supplies expense  offset by an increase in lifo expense of basis points as a percentage of sales 
the gross margin rate included million for the initial recognition of gift card breakage income  which contributed approximately basis points of improvement as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  to million for the year ended january   as compared to an increase in the number of stores in operation and an increase in customer traffic during the year ended january   as compared to  led to higher overall store level labor expenses and other costs to operate our stores 
with more stores in operation during fiscal  our salary and benefit expenses increased million and our other store operating expenses increased million  compared to these increases were offset by a decrease of million in our corporate administrative expenses for the year ended january   as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to share based compensation expenses for corporate employees and related payroll tax expense of million associated with our initial public offering in and was partially offset by a million increase in corporate compensation expense  which was primarily attributable to increased headcount for the year ended january   as compared to excluding the ipo related share based compensation and related payroll tax expense  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  increased  or million from million  as adjusted  for the year ended december  as a percent of sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended january  were  or basis points higher than  as adjusted 
selling  general and administrative expenses included higher corporate expenses  driven by approximately million in new expenses attributable to the our public company status and approximately million in transaction expenses incurred in connection with our public offering of common stock in fiscal  which together adversely impacted selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately basis points during fiscal in addition to these higher expenses corporate expenses  we also incurred incremental expenses opening new stores in fiscal  mostly offset by an improvement in store level and corporate compensation expense as a percentage of sales

interest expense interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended january   as compared to  due primarily to reduced weighted average borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we also benefited from the expiration of an interest rate swap for the year ended january  for which we paid a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
income tax expense income tax expense increased million for the year ended january   as compared to the increase was attributable to the termination of our s corporation election and the conversion to a c corporation in november in connection with our initial public offering  and as a result  we are now subject to additional entity level taxes that are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the effective income tax rate for the year ending january   was as compared to on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  the decrease was mostly attributable to inventory food donations to charitable organizations

selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of sales by basis points in january  mostly due to new public company costs and incremental share based compensation expense

our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  operating expenses  capital expenditures primarily for opening new stores and relocating and remodeling existing stores  debt service  corporate taxes  and while we were an s corporation  distributions to our stockholders 
we believe that the cash generated from operations  together with the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months  including investments made  and expenses incurred  in connection with opening new stores and relocating and remodeling existing stores and other strategic initiatives 
these strategic initiatives include the replacement of store equipment and product display fixtures  and investments in information technology and merchandising enhancements 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or  in the case of credit or debit card transactions  within a few business days of the related sale 
at january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in borrowing availability pursuant to our credit facility 
the credit facility is discussed under financing activities and revolving credit facility below 
while we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements and expansion plans  we may elect to pursue additional expansion opportunities within the next year which could require additional debt or equity financing 
if we are unable to secure additional financing at favorable terms in order to pursue such additional expansion opportunities  our ability to pursue such opportunities could be materially adversely affected

lease inducement payments are recorded as a long term asset and expensed over the primary term of the lease 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased  or million  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in tax payments 
investing activities cash used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures for opening new stores and relocating and remodeling existing stores  as well as investments in information technology and merchandising enhancements 
year ended january  january  december  in thousands purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sale of property and equipment net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures decreased million to million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended january  the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to higher than normal spending on certain real estate projects  including the purchase of land during the year ended january   as well as a decrease in spending related to the number of remodels and relocations for the year ended january  we relocated one store during the year ended january   compared to relocating two stores and remodeling two stores during the year ended january  in april  we received proceeds of million from a land and building sale leaseback transaction 
capital expenditures increased million to million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to an increase in new store growth  merchandising initiatives  and equipment upgrades and enhancements to existing stores for the year ended january  during the year ended january   the company opened new stores  relocated stores  and remodeled stores compared to stores that were opened in the prior year 
additionally  the increase in new store capital expenditures was related to higher than normal spending on certain projects  including the purchase of land 
our new store capital expenditures also included several buildings constructed  versus our typical leasehold improvements 
we plan to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily related to real estate investments as we plan to remodel  relocate and construct and open more stores in fiscal than in fiscal financing activities cash used in financing activities consists principally of borrowings and payments under our revolving credit facility  and for the year ended december   equity issuance costs associated with our initial public offering  and prior to our initial public offering  distributions to our stockholders 
prior to our initial public offering the distributions to our stockholders consisted of both discretionary distributions and distributions to enable our stockholders to pay their tax obligations due to our s corporation status  which we funded through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we currently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock

net repayments under our revolving credit facility were million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended january  net cash used in financing activities for the years ended january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the elimination of distributions to our stockholders 
we currently expect to retain future earnings  if any  for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
on february   we terminated our credit facility and entered into a new credit facility defined below 
at closing  approximately million was drawn under the credit facility to repay borrowings under the credit facility  which is included in both borrowings and payments on the revolving credit agreement for the year ended january  in connection with the new credit agreement we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs 
net repayments under our revolving credit facility during the years ended january  and december  were million and million  respectively 
revolving credit facility we are party to a revolving credit facility with bank of america  na as administrative agent  swing line lender  and letter of credit issuer  and several other lending institutions the credit facility 
the credit facility matures february   and is available to provide support for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  including permitted acquisitions  issuance of letters of credit  refinancing and payment of fees 
while we currently have no material domestic subsidiaries  other entities will guarantee our obligations under the credit facility if and when they become material domestic subsidiaries during the term of the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for total borrowings of up to million 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are entitled to request an increase in the size of the facility by an amount not exceeding million in the aggregate 
if the existing lenders elect not to provide the full amount of a requested increase  or in lieu of accepting offers from existing lenders to increase their commitments  we may designate one or more other lender s to become a party to the credit facility  subject to the approval of the administrative agent 
the credit facility includes a letter of credit sublimit of million and a swing line sublimit of million 
at our option  outstanding borrowings bear interest at i the london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  ii the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  or iii the base rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  where the base rate is defined as the greatest of a the federal funds rate plus  b bank of america s prime rate  and c the eurodollar rate plus 
in november  we amended the commitment fee calculated on the unused portions of the credit facility from a range of to per annum to a range of to per annum 
as of january  and january   all outstanding borrowings bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin 
the credit facility contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants  including limitations on our ability to grant liens  incur additional debt  pay dividends  redeem our common stock  make certain investments and engage in certain merger  consolidation or asset sale transactions 
in addition  the agreement provides that we will be required to maintain the following financial ratios a consolidated maximum leverage ratio as of the end of any quarter of not more than to  based upon the ratio of i adjusted funded debt as defined in the credit facility to ii ebitdar as defined in the credit facility over the period consisting of the four fiscal quarters ending on or before the determination date  and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  based upon the ratio of i ebitdar as defined in the credit facility less cash taxes paid by the company and certain discretionary distributions over the period consisting of the four fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to the determination date to ii the sum of interest expense  cash lease and rent expense and the current portion of capitalized lease obligations for such period and the current portion of long term liabilities for the four fiscal quarters ending as of the end of any quarter on or prior to the determination date

for a more detailed description of our credit facility  see note to our consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this document 
the outstanding advances under the credit facility bore variable interest at one month libor plus an applicable margin  which was at january  for purposes of this table  we estimated interest expense to be paid during the remaining term of the credit facility using the outstanding balance and interest rate as of january  our actual cash payments for interest under the credit facility will fluctuate as the outstanding balance changes with our cash needs and the one month libor rate fluctuates

represents the minimum lease payments due under our operating leases  excluding common area maintenance  insurance and taxes related to our operating lease obligations  which combined represented approximately of our minimum lease obligations for the year ended january  for a more detailed description of our operating leases  see note to our consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this document 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services made in the normal course of business that are enforceable and legally binding on us 
our purchase obligations consist predominantly of contracts to purchase certain inventory items 
this amount does not include any payment obligations with respect to products on hand at our logistics providers as we do not typically take title or have any obligation to pay for products purchased by our logistics provider until we receive the products at our store locations 
although we occasionally have obligations to purchase any inventory on hand in the event a contract with a logistics provider is terminated  we also generally enter into arrangements with any subsequent logistics provider or distributor pursuant to which the subsequent logistics provider or distributor purchases the inventory on hand at the former logistics provider or distributor or we deplete the inventory on hand at the former logistics provider or distributor as the termination date approaches 
as part of an agreement with an entity and various related parties of the entity  we acquired certain lease rights to four new store locations 
in connection with the agreement  we are required to maintain cash in an escrow account with an independent third party  which is to be transferred to the entity as each property is delivered to us in the condition specified by the agreement 
we periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business 
we believe that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements at january  consist of outstanding letters of credit discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this document and of operating leases 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements or changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies in presenting our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
some of the estimates and assumptions that we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
predominantly all of our inventories are valued using the last in  first out  or lifo  method whereby the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory 
we use the link chain method for computing dollar value lifo  whereby the base year values of beginning and ending inventories are determined using cumulative price indexes published by the bureau of labor statistics 
valuing inventory using lifo requires management to select from different available methods 
using a different method could result in a change in our estimate of the lifo value of our inventory and that difference could be materially different 
we determine the current cost of our inventories using the first in  first out  or fifo method 
the fifo value of inventories includes cost of goods and freight  net of vendor rebates and discounts 
the excess of the current cost of inventories over the lifo value  or the lifo reserve  was approximately million at january   million at january   and million at january  impairment of long lived assets we assess our long lived assets  principally property and equipment  for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if impairment is indicated  a loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset 
our judgment regarding the existence of circumstances that indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable  and therefore potentially impaired  is based on several factors  including a decision to close a store or an unexpected decline in long term cash flows 
determining whether impairment exists requires that we use estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows and operating results for the asset or assets being assessed 
our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions concerning variables such as the potential impact of operational changes  competitive factors  inflation and the economy 
our estimate of fair value used in calculating an impairment loss is based on market values  if available  or our estimated future cash flow projections discounted to their present value 
using different assumptions and definitions could result in a change in our estimates of cash flows and fair value and those differences could produce materially different results 
closed store reserves we record a reserve for future lease obligations associated with stores that are no longer being utilized in our current operations 
the fair value of the closed store liability is estimated using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments at the cease use date for the store  net of an estimate of subtenant income 
lease payments for operating leases included in our closed store reserve are expected to be paid over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
our assumptions about future cash payments to be made as part of the lease agreements are based on the terms contained in the lease agreement 
in determining the fair value of the liability  we offset the future lease payments with an estimate of the amount of subtenant income that could be reasonably obtained for the store properties 
our expectations of potential subtenant income are based on variable factors including our knowledge of the geographical area in which the closed property is located and existing economic conditions 
we also seek advice from local brokers and agents  commercial market value analysts  and third party fair value reports to develop our assumptions 
while we believe our current estimates of reserves for closed properties are adequate  it is possible that market and economic conditions could cause us to change our assumptions and may require additional reserves 
we review our estimates used in determining the closed store reserve on a quarterly basis and record adjustments  if necessary  in the period in which the change becomes known 
insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation  automobile and general liability  product liability  director and officers liability  employee health care benefits  and other casualty and property risks 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
a change in our insurance liabilities at january  would have affected our annual operating income by approximately million 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable is accrued  and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we apply the provisions of the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes that was issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
pursuant to this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the authoritative guidance also addresses other items related to uncertainty in income taxes including derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in november  we converted from s corporation status to a c corporation under subchapter c of the internal revenue code  thereby ceasing to be a pass through entity for income tax purposes 
as a result  we recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities using the estimated corporate effective tax rate 
in prior years  we elected to be treated as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code for federal income tax purposes and for state income tax purposes where allowed 
in general  corporate taxable income or loss of an s corporation is allocated to its stockholders for inclusion in their personal income tax returns 
therefore  in prior years no provision or liability for federal or state income tax has been provided in our consolidated financial statements except for those states where s corporation status is not recognized 
share based compensation omnibus incentive compensation plan we grant options to purchase common stock under the fresh market  inc omnibus incentive compensation plan plan  which was adopted and approved by the board of directors during the plan provides for the grant of options intended to qualify as incentive stock options isos  nonqualified stock options nsos  stock appreciation rights sars  restricted share awards  restricted stock units rsus  performance compensation awards  cash incentive awards  deferred share units and other equity based and equity related awards 
in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of certain assumptions  including the expected life of the share based award  stock price volatility  dividend yield and interest rate 
because there is limited history for our common stock  the expected life and volatility are based on historical data of publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to ours  such as plan design  industry  stage of life cycle and size  which we consider as part of a peer group that we use for the purposes of the black scholes option pricing model 
expected life is based on the median expected term of the peer group as disclosed in their publicly available financial statements 
volatility is calculated by taking the median of the historical volatilities of the peer group 
since our ipo we have not declared dividends and we do not plan to pay any dividends in the future 
the risk free rate for periods in the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of the grant 
the awards are based on a four year graded vesting schedule over the requisite service period and we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis for all share based awards net of estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of rsus and restricted stock awards is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the rsu awards are based on a four year graded vesting schedule over the requisite service period and we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis for rsus net of estimated forfeitures 
restricted share awards issued to independent directors vest pursuant to the plan at the earlier of one year or the next annual meeting of the stockholders and for the restricted stock awards  we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the vesting period 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards as share based compensation expense over the performance period based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
we assess the probability of achieving the performance targets at each reporting period 
cumulative adjustments  if any  are recorded quarterly to reflect subsequent changes in the estimated outcome of performance related conditions 
the fair value of the performance based awards is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes of our long term debt 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility carries floating interest rates that are tied to libor  eurodollar  the federal funds rate or the base rate  and therefore  our statements of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates to the extent that we do not have effective hedging arrangements in place 
based upon a sensitivity analysis at january   a hypothetical change in interest rates would change our annual interest expense by approximately million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
