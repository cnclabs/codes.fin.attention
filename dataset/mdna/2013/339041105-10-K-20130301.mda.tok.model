we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
however  we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to each of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently 
as a result  a specific offering of our products and service features  networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers preferences 
we compete with independent fleet card providers  providers of card outsourcing services and major financial services companies as well as major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards 
we also compete with providers of alternative payment mechanisms  such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards  and merchants offering house accounts as well as other forms of credit

acquisitions for a discussion of recent acquisitions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations acquisitions 
regulatory a substantial number of laws and regulations  both in the united states and in other jurisdictions  apply to businesses offering payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts 
in the united states  these laws apply primarily to consumer cards  which are cards used to make purchases for personal  family or household purposes 
because our payment cards are limited to purchases for business purposes only  they are typically classified as commercial cards and are generally not subject to many of the laws and regulations applicable to consumer cards 
as a result  our business is less regulated than one that provides products or services to consumers  yet  we are still subject to significant domestic and foreign regulation 
the following  while not exhaustive  is a description of several federal and state laws and regulations in the united states that are applicable to our business 
the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions also affect us  and they may be more or less restrictive than those in the united states and may also impact different parts of our operations 
in addition  the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing revision  and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us 
federal trade commission act the federal trade commission act empowers the federal trade commission  or ftc  to regulate unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce 
while this power is generally exercised to protect consumers  the ftc has sometimes taken action on behalf of small businesses 
a number of state laws and regulations also prohibit unfair and deceptive business practices 
truth in lending act the truth in lending act  or tila  was enacted to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and is implemented by regulation z 
most provisions of tila and regulation z apply only to the extension of consumer credit  but a limited number apply to commercial cards as well 
one example where tila and regulation z are generally applicable is a limitation on liability for unauthorized use  although a business that acquires or more credit cards for its personnel can agree to more expansive liability 
our cardholder agreements generally provide for these business customers to waive  to the fullest extent possible  all limitations on liability for unauthorized card use 

table of contents 
index to financial statements credit card accountability  responsibility  and disclosure act of the credit card accountability  responsibility  and disclosure act of amended provisions of tila that affect consumer credit and also directed the federal reserve board to study the use of credit cards by small businesses and to make legislative recommendations 
the report concluded that it is not clear whether the potential benefits outweigh the increased cost and reduced credit availability if the disclosure and substantive restrictions applicable to consumer cards were to be applied to small business cards 
legislation has been introduced to increase the protections afforded to small businesses that use payment cards 
if legislation of this kind were enacted  our products and services for small businesses could be impacted 
equal credit opportunity act the equal credit opportunity act  or ecoa  together with regulation b prohibit creditors from discriminating on certain prohibited bases  such as an applicant s sex  race  nationality  age and marital status  and further requires that creditors disclose the reasons for taking any adverse action against an applicant or a customer seeking credit 
the fair credit reporting act the fair credit reporting act  or fcra  regulates consumer reporting agencies and the disclosure and use of consumer reports 
we may obtain consumer reports with respect to an individual who guarantees or otherwise is obligated on a commercial card 
fact act the fair and accurate credit transactions act of amended fcra and requires creditors to adopt identity theft prevention programs to detect  prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with covered accounts  which can include business accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft 
bank secrecy act the currency and foreign transactions reporting act  which is also known as the bank secrecy act and which has been amended by the usa patriot act of  contains a variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering 
among other things  the bank secrecy act and implementing regulations issued by the us treasury department require financial services providers to establish anti money laundering programs  to report suspicious activity  and to maintain a number of related records 
we maintain anti money laundering controls designed to prevent our network from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  or the dodd frank act  effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions  financial services  and financial markets 
among its most notable provisions is the creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection  which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila  ecoa  fcra  and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit 
the implementation of the dodd frank act is still in its early stages  and as a result  its overall impact remains far from clear 
its provisions  however  are sufficiently far reaching that  even though our industry was not targeted  it is possible that we could be directly or indirectly impacted 
for example  a provision of the law requires credit card issuers to collect and report information regarding applications made by women and minority owned businesses and small businesses 
we are preparing for this requirement  but proposed regulations have not been published

state usury laws extensions of credit under many of our card products may be treated as commercial loans 
in some states  usury laws limit the interest rates that can be charged not only on consumer loans but on commercial loans as well 
to the extent that these usury laws apply  we are limited in the amount of interest that we can charge and collect from our customers 
because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions  we utilize choice of law provisions in our cardholder agreements as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply 
in addition  the interest rates on certain of our card products are set based upon the usury limit of the cardholder s state 
with respect to card products where we work with a partner or issuing bank  the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and exports the usury limit of that state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions 
other laws and regulations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing privacy  data security  and breach notification 
we are also subject to debt collection laws and to bankruptcy and other debtor relief laws that can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results  financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
see note regarding forward looking statements in this report 
risks related to our business a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel 
accordingly  our revenue is affected by fuel prices  which are subject to significant volatility 
a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount 
we believe that in  approximately of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel 
changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts 
a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
fuel prices are dependent on several factors  all of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others supply and demand for oil and gas  and market expectations regarding supply and demand  actions by members of opec and other major oil producing nations  new oil production being developed in the us and elsewhere  political conditions in oil producing and gas producing nations  including insurgency  terrorism or war  oil refinery capacity  weather  the prices of foreign exports  the implementation of fuel efficiency standards and the adoption by our fleet customers of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency or alternative fuel sources  general worldwide economic conditions  and governmental regulations  taxes and tariffs 
a portion of our revenue is derived from fuel price spreads 
as a result  a contraction in fuel price spreads could adversely affect our operating results 
approximately of our consolidated revenue in was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuel price spreads 
fuel price spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant 
in transactions where we derive revenue from fuel price spreads  the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission 
the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including  among others  the factors described above affecting fuel prices 
the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including  among others  the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant  posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices 
we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers  or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel 
accordingly  when fuel price spreads contract  we generate less revenue  which could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers  we could experience an increase in credit loss 
we are subject to the credit risk of our customers  many of which are small to mid sized businesses 
we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits  but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are fraudulently completed 
changes in our industry and movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and  as a result  increased credit losses 
we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time 
further  during a declining economic environment  we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers 
if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks  our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards 
any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges  or limitations on our fees and charges  could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions  cards  reports  late payments and optional services 
we derived approximately of our consolidated revenues from these fees and charges during the year ended december  if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity  the extent to which they pay invoices late or their use of optional services  our revenue could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges  including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts 
furthermore  regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry s pricing  charges and other practices related to its customers 
any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue 
any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we operate in a competitive business environment  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive  and competition could intensify in the future 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
our primary competitors in north america are small  regional and large independent fleet card providers  major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 
competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies  online lodging discounters  internal corporate procurement and travel resources  and independent services companies  among others 
we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms  such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit 
our primary competitors in europe are independent fleet card providers  major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards  and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 
our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of food and fleet cards and vouchers  commercial fleet cards offered by the major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 
the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features  network acceptance size  customer service and account management and price 
we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently 
as a result  a specific offering of our products and service features  networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers preferences 

table of contents 
index to financial statements some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand name recognition  larger customer bases  more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources 
in addition  our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions 
for example  major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuel card services as a complement to their existing card products and services 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities  standards or customer requirements 
to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories  they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 
future mergers or consolidations among competitors  or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business 
resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuel card products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized non fuel card related products and services 
further  competitors may reduce the fees for their services  which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 
overall  increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure  reduced profit margins  increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase  or a loss of  market share 
we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business is dependent on several key strategic relationships  the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 
we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies 
we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our partners 
during  our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from less than one year up to eight years 
the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies 
in our relationships with these major oil companies  our services are marketed under our partners brands 
if these partners fail to maintain their brands  or decrease the size of their branded networks  our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected 
our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company  we often must participate in a competitive bidding process  which may focus on a limited number of factors  such as pricing 
the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period 
the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships 
our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win this business 
the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend  in part  on our merchant relationships to grow our business 
to grow our customer base  we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging 
if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships  our business may be adversely affected 
a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers  our new and enhanced product and service offerings and cross selling our products and services through existing merchant relationships 
we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution 
table of contents 
index to financial statements channels in order to expand our customer base 
there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue 
similarly  our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closed loop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging 
our contractual agreements with fuel merchants typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a year to year basis unless either party gives notice of termination 
our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a month to month basis unless either party gives notice of termination 
furthermore  merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy  financial distress  or otherwise be forced to contract their operations 
the loss of existing merchant relationships  the contraction of our existing merchants operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 
a decline in general economic conditions  and in particular  a decline in demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services would adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally  both in the united states and internationally 
we generate revenue based in part on the volume of fuel purchase transactions we process 
our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions  particularly in the united states  europe and latin america  and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate 
downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and  consequently  reduced purchasing of fuel and other vehicle products and services by businesses 
unfavorable changes in economic conditions  including declining consumer confidence  inflation  recession or other changes  may lead our customers  which are largely comprised of commercial fleets  to demand less fuel  or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services 
these declines could result from  among other things  reduced fleet traffic  corporate purchasing  travel and other commercial activities from which we derive revenue 
further  economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and  as a result  our reserve for credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable could increase 
in addition  demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control  such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states  europe and latin america 
as a result  sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states  europe or latin america  or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate  could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future 
if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past 
for example  within the past several years we have entered into the fuel and food card and voucher business in mexico  the lodging card business in the united states  the fuel transaction processing business in brazil and offer a limited telematics service to european customers 
we may continue to enter new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations 
if we are unable to do so  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
if we fail to develop and implement new technology  products and services  adapt our products and services to changes in technology or the marketplace  or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology  products and services are not successful  we could lose customers and partners 
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive  and characterized by technological change  frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards 
we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners  in order to maintain and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements improve upon our competitive position 
we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing  marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands  which could jeopardize our competitive position 
in addition  we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis 
if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology  otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology  products and services  it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 
our debt obligations  or our incurrence of additional debt obligations  could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 
at december   we had approximately million of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility 
in addition  we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness  subject to specified limitations 
our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding  or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness  could have important consequences  including the following we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations under our debt facilities and  if we fail to satisfy these obligations  an event of default could result  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate activities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations  which sets forth our payment obligations with respect to our existing long term debt  covenants relating to our debt may limit our ability to enter into certain contracts or to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate activities  covenants relating to our debt may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  including by restricting our ability to make strategic acquisitions  we may be more vulnerable than our competitors to the impact of economic downturns and adverse developments in the industry in which we operate  we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest  although we have no current intention to pay any dividends  we may be unable to pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to your investment  and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors 
the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
in addition  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions  and under certain circumstances  the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
if new debt is added to our existing debt levels  the related risks that we will face would increase 
we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility  which we must renew on an annual basis 
we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility  pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a special purpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers  who finance their purchases through the issuance of short term commercial paper 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the securitization facility has a one year term 
during the financial crisis that began in  the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility 
although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us 
a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility 
there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs 
further  we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources 
our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business  including our relationships with merchants  customers and partners 
further  we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest 
we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 
as a result of our foreign operations  we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily czech koruna  russian ruble  british pound  brazilian real and mexican peso 
revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income 
volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars  and  as we continue to expand  we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions 
these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 
we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions  which may divert our management s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties  increased costs and dilution to our stockholders 
we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
we have been an active business acquirer both in north america and internationally  and  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to seek to acquire businesses  commercial account portfolios  technologies  services and products in the future 
we have substantially expanded our overall business  customer base  headcount and operations through acquisitions 
the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses  technologies  products  personnel or operations of the acquired business 
furthermore  acquisitions may involve our entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience  involve difficulties in retaining the customers of the acquired business  involve difficulties and expense associated with regulatory requirements  competition controls or investigations  result in a delay or reduction of sales for both us and the business we acquire  and disrupt our ongoing business  divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including  for example difficulty managing geographically separated organizations  systems and facilities  difficulty integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds  languages and organizational cultures  difficulty and expense introducing our corporate policies or controls  increased expense to comply with foreign regulatory requirements applicable to acquisitions  difficulty entering new foreign markets due to  among other things  lack of customer acceptance and a lack of business knowledge of these new markets  and political  social and economic instability 
to complete future acquisitions  we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all  which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions 
moreover  we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition  such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings  would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 
further  an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities  may cause adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges  may require the amortization  write down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation  goodwill and other intangible assets  or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 
we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the united states 
we have foreign operations in  or provide services for commercial card accounts in belarus  belgium  botswana  brazil  canada  the czech republic  estonia  ireland  latvia  lithuania  luxembourg  mexico  namibia  the netherlands  pakistan  poland  the russian federation  slovakia  south africa  swaziland  ukraine and the united kingdom 
we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia  europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 
some of the countries where we operate  and other countries where we will seek to operate  specifically russia  brazil and mexico  have undergone significant political  economic and social change in recent years  and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the united states 
in particular  changes in laws or regulations  including with respect to taxation  information technology  data transmission and the internet  or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations  whether caused by a change in government or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the united states 
these include difficulties in managing the staffing of our international operations  including hiring and retaining qualified employees  difficulties and increased expense introducing corporate policies and controls in our international operations  
table of contents 
index to financial statements increased expense related to localization of our products and services  including language translation and the creation of localized agreements  potentially adverse tax consequences  including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and changes in tax rates  increased expense to comply with foreign laws and legal standards  including laws that regulate pricing and promotion activities and the import and export of information technology  which can be difficult to monitor and are often subject to change  increased expense to comply with us laws that apply to foreign operations  including the foreign corrupt practices act and office of foreign assets control regulations  increased expense to comply with uk laws that apply to foreign operations  including the uk bribery act  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  political  social and economic instability  terrorist attacks and security concerns in general  and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights and cultural norms in some geographies that are simply not respectful of intellectual property rights 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and  consequently  our operating results 
further  operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources 
due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions  international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the united states 
we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish  acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 
we are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties  which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 
our ability to process and authorize transactions electronically depends on our ability to communicate with our merchants electronically through point of sale devices and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties 
in addition  in order to process transactions promptly  our computer equipment and network servers must be functional hours a day  which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by third parties and the availability of electricity  which we do not control 
a severe disruption of one or more of these networks  including as a result of utility or third party system interruptions  could impair our ability to authorize transactions and process information  which could harm our reputation  result in a loss of customers or partners and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we also utilize third party providers to assist us with disaster recovery operations 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of a provider s unresponsiveness in the event of a significant breakdown in our computer equipment or networks 
furthermore  our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 
we may experience software defects  system errors  computer viruses and development delays  which could damage customer relationships  decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 
our products and services are based on proprietary and third party network technology and processing systems that may encounter development delays and could be susceptible to undetected errors  viruses or defects 
development delays  system errors  viruses or defects that result in service interruption or data loss could have a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements material adverse effect on our business  damage our reputation and subject us to third party liability 
in addition  errors  viruses and defects in our network technology and processing systems could result in additional development costs and the diversion of our technical and other resources from other development efforts or operations 
further  our attempts to limit our potential liability  through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our agreements  may not be successful 
we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards 
under certain circumstances  when we fund customer transactions  we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards 
we do not maintain any insurance to protect us against any such losses 
we may not be able to adequately protect the data we collect  which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 
we electronically receive  process  store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and partners  including bank account information and expense data 
we keep this information confidential  however  our websites  networks  information systems  services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage  disruption or misappropriation 
unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks  any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation  expose us to liability  decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 
any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market for fleet card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 
our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets 
if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability  businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services 
similarly  growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally 
furthermore  new technologies may displace fleet cards as payment mechanisms for fuel purchase transactions 
a decline in the acceptance and use of fleet cards  and electronic payment transactions generally  by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market for our lodging cards and food vouchers and cards is also evolving and that portion of our business is subject to similar risks 
our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets 
the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately of our total assets at december  these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions  which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets 
under current accounting standards  we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset  while goodwill is not amortized 
on at least an annual basis  we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired  then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings 
an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information  our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on copyright  trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  all of which offer only limited protection 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights  and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain  particularly in countries outside of the united states 
in addition  our confidentiality agreements with employees  vendors  customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 
protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive  difficult and not always possible 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  to protect our confidential information  including trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation could be costly and divert management resources  either of which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
accordingly  despite our efforts  we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology 
moreover  others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property 
the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful  and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful  even when our rights have been infringed 
furthermore  effective patent  trademark  service mark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 
claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 
third parties could claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property 
in addition  to the extent that we gain greater visibility  market exposure  and add new products and services  we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties 
we may  in the future  receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party s intellectual property rights 
there may be third party intellectual property rights  including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies  processes or business methods 
any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party  even those without merit  could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims 
some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do 
furthermore  a party making such a claim  if successful  could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages  potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services 
in addition  we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party s intellectual property  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
alternatively  we might be required to develop non infringing technology  which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 
third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes 
any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf  regardless of the merits of these claims  because under certain conditions we agree to indemnify our customers from third party claims of intellectual property infringement

our success depends  in part  on our executive officers and other key personnel 
our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace 
the market for qualified individuals is competitive  and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel 
the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 
changes in laws  regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 
the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the united states and internationally 
domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities  which can be difficult to administer because of their scope  mandates and varied requirements 
we are subject to a number of government regulations  including  among others interest rate and fee restrictions  credit access and disclosure requirements  collection and pricing regulations  compliance obligations  security and data breach requirements  identity theft avoidance programs  and anti money laundering compliance programs 
government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements 
while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection  legislatures continue to consider whether to include business consumers within the scope of these regulations 
as a result  new or expanded regulation focusing on business cardholders or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results  due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 
our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry  which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses  their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services  and the costs of their operations 
these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 
in addition  we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations  including those related to state occupancy taxes  value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions 
changes in tax laws or their interpretations could increase our tax liability  further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 
our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal  state  local  and international taxing authorities 
an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense  thereby negatively impacting our results of operations 
we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions  transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item 
these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority 
there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability 
an unfavorable resolution  therefore  could negatively impact our financial position  operating results and cash flows in the current and or future periods 
we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes 
deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates 
changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results

index to financial statements we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business  which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 
our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries 
therefore  we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries 
for example  unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel  railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business  resulting in decreased revenue  or increased credit risk and related losses  resulting in increased expenses 
in addition  mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base  resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 
we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 
in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities  including state and local government customers  as well as federal government agencies 
as a result  we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal  state and local governments 
the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among private contracts 
in addition  we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 
litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines  penalties or requirements resulting in increased expenses 
we are not currently party to any legal proceedings or governmental inquiries or investigations that we consider to be material  except as described below  and we were not involved in any material legal proceedings that terminated during the fourth quarter 
we are and may become  however  subject to lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
we are currently involved in an investigation by the office of fair trading in the united kingdom  relating to our keyfuels product line 
this product line consists of our proprietary payment card and associated site network in the united kingdom 
a competitor alleged we are dominant in a relevant market with our keyfuels product line 
the office of fair trading is investigating whether we are dominant and  if dominant  whether some of our contracts with some sites and dealers would constitute exclusive dealings requiring them to be reformed to eliminate exclusivity 
the office of fair trading has issued a statement of objections  which we responded to  and we are awaiting its conclusions 
if determined adversely  the regulator has authority to require us to reform contracts to eliminate exclusivity and impose significant fines  which could be material 
any adverse determination is appealable to the competition appeal tribunal 
we rely on third parties for card issuing and processing services supporting our mastercard network fleet card products 
failure to maintain these contractual relationships upon acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card offerings  customer retention and operating results 
some of our fleet card products in north america are accepted in the mastercard merchant network pursuant to our contractual relationships with issuing banks and third party processors 
in order to continue offering fleet cards accepted at mastercard network merchants  we must maintain our contractual relationship with at least one issuing bank 
further  unless we develop our own mastercard approved processing capabilities  we must continue to obtain processing services from at least one processor approved by mastercard with the capability to provide acceptable levels of reporting data for fleet operators 
our failure to maintain adequate relationships  or find suitable alternatives  could have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card products  our customer retention and our operating results 
changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 
a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants  known as interchange fees  associated with transactions processed using our mastercard branded fleet cards 
interchange fee amounts associated 
table of contents 
index to financial statements with our mastercard network fleet cards are affected by a number of factors  including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard 
in addition  interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry  which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future 
temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network fleet card transactions  could adversely affect our business and operating results 
if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands  it could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships  and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees 
the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts  our ability to continue to offer high quality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors 
in addition  future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands  particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas 
the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures  and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets 
to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues  this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur 
there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 
failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act  and similar laws associated with our international activities  could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 
as we continue to expand our business internationally  we may expand into certain foreign countries  particularly those with developing economies  where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us and us regulations  including the united states foreign corrupt practices act  or the fcpa  and the uk bribery act 
such laws prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we have implemented policies to discourage such practices  however  there can be no assurances that all of our employees  consultants and agents  including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary  will not take actions in violation of our policies  for which we may be ultimately responsible 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and suspension or debarment from us government contracting  which could negatively affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks related to ownership of our common stock our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following quarterly variations in our results of operations  results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  results of operations that vary from those of our competitors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  or capital commitments  announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us  regulatory developments in the united states and abroad  future sales of our common stock  and additions or departures of key personnel  and general domestic and international economic  market and currency factors and conditions unrelated to our performance 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management s attention and resources 
our principal stockholders have a controlling influence over our business affairs 
our principal stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own or control  directly or indirectly  at december   approximately  shares of our common stock  which in the aggregate represents approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  if some of these persons or entities act together  they will have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election and removal of directors  amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination 
these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares  which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 
some of these persons or entities who make up our principal stockholders may have interests different from our other stockholders 
for example  they may be more interested in selling fleetcor to an acquirer than other stockholders or may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders 
our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 
we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act 
our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission 
we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in our control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 
our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders 
these provisions stagger the terms of our board of directors and require supermajority stockholder voting to remove directors  authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares  which may be senior to our common stock  without prior stockholder approval  establish advance notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  prohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent  and require supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  our certificate of incorporation prohibits large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or consolidating with us except under certain circumstances 
these provisions could discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

in both of our segments  we derive revenue from transactions and the related revenue per transaction 
as illustrated in the diagram below  a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer 
our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners  for whom we manage card programs 
revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as our customers and partners 
through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel  vehicle maintenance  food or lodging services to our customers 
we also earn revenue from our customers and partners through program fees and charges 
the following diagram illustrates a typical transaction flow 
illustrative transaction flow logo from our merchant and network relationships  we derive revenue mostly from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction 
as illustrated in the table below  the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup  ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount  or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit 
the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission

this non renewed contract contributed approximately million transactions and million in revenues  net to our international segment in this contract had a high number of transactions and very little revenue and if we had included it in the calculation would have reduced international segment revenue per transaction negatively by in we believe that excluding the impact of this contract is a more effective measure for evaluating the revenue performance of our continuing business 
revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography  the relevant merchant relationship  the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased  the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions  organic growth in our business  and the overall macroeconomic environment  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases  as macroeconomic factors changes and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue per transaction in our international segment has historically run higher than the north america segment due primarily to higher margins and higher fuel prices in our international product lines 
however  acquisitions in have significantly impacted revenue per transaction in our international segment  as well as on a consolidated basis 
in  we acquired a mexican business and allstar in the uk  which together contributed to the increase in transaction volumes and revenues in our international segment 
while the acquired mexican and uk businesses represent good profit margin businesses  they do have lower revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses 
the impact of the products offered by our businesses acquired in mexico and the uk were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions completed in in  we acquired a russian fuel card business and ctf technologies  inc ctf  which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our businesses 
however  the overall impact of these acquisitions resulted in lower revenue per transaction for our international segment and on a consolidated basis 
from to  total transactions increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
we experienced an increase in transactions in our north american and international segments primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions completed in and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in from to  total transactions increased from million to million  excluding the impact of a non renewed partner contract in europe  an increase of million or

sources of revenue 
set forth below are our sources of revenue for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues year ended december  revenue from customers and partners revenue from merchants and networks revenue tied to fuel price spreads revenue influenced by absolute price of fuel revenue from program fees  late fees  interest and other although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of fuel price spreads and the absolute price of fuel on our consolidated revenues  we believe these percentages approximate their relative impacts

the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate 
thus  we believe this is a more 
table of contents 
index to financial statements effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis 
we use ebitda  calculated as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to eliminate the impact of certain non core items during the period 
we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis 
adjusted revenues  ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental non gaap financial measures of operating performance 
see the heading entitled management s use of non gaap financial measures 
sources of expenses we incur expenses in the following categories merchant commissions we incur merchant commissions expenses when we reimburse merchants with whom we have direct  contractual relationships in respect of specific transactions in which a customer purchases products or services from the merchant 
merchant commission equals the difference between the price paid by us to the merchant and the merchant s wholesale cost of the underlying products or services 
processing our processing expense consists of expenses related to processing transactions  servicing our customers and merchants and bad debt expense 
selling our selling expenses consist primarily of wages  benefits  sales commissions other than merchant commissions and related expenses for our sales  marketing and account management personnel and activities 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include compensation and related expenses including stock based compensation for our executive  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  legal and other administrative personnel

interest expense  net interest expense  net includes interest income on our cash balances and interest expense on our outstanding debt and excludes interest on our securitization facility 
we have historically invested our cash primarily in short term money market funds 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes consists primarily of corporate income taxes related to profits resulting from the sale of our products and services in the united states and internationally 
our worldwide effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate of  due primarily to lower rates in foreign jurisdictions and foreign sourced non taxable income 
factors and trends impacting our business we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance fuel prices our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel 
accordingly  our revenue is affected by fuel prices  which are subject to significant

index to financial statements volatility 
a change in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease or increase in our revenue from several sources  including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer s total purchase 
we believe that approximately  and of our consolidated revenue in  and  respectively  was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel 
changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts 
fuel price spread volatility a portion of our revenue involves transactions where we derive revenue from fuel price spreads  which is the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant for the same transaction 
in these transactions  the price paid to the merchant is based on the wholesale cost of fuel 
the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including  among others  the factors described above affecting fuel prices 
the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including  among others  the fuel price paid to the merchant  posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices 
we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers  or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel 
approximately  and of our consolidated revenue in  and  respectively  was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuel price spreads 
acquisitions since  we have completed over acquisitions of companies and commercial account portfolios 
acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy  and it is our intention to continue to seek opportunities to increase our customer base and diversify our service offering through further strategic acquisitions 
the impact of acquisitions has  and may continue to have  a significant impact on our results of operations and may make it difficult to compare our results between periods 
interest rates our results of operations are affected by interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt 
global economic downturn our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally  both in north america and internationally 
factors affected by the economy include our transaction volumes and the credit risk of our customers 
these factors affected our businesses in both our north american and international segments 
foreign currency changes our results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency rates  namely  by movements of the british pound  czech koruna  russian ruble  canadian dollar  euro  brazilian real and mexican peso relative to the us dollar 
approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively  was derived in us dollars and was not affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
expenses over the long term  we expect that our general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue increases 
to support our expected revenue growth  we plan to continue to incur additional sales and marketing expense by investing in our direct marketing  third party agents  internet marketing  telemarketing and field sales force 
accounts receivable securitization we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility securitization facility in the ordinary course of our business to finance a portion of our accounts receivable 
prior to  activity associated with our securitization facility was recorded off balance sheet utilizing a qualified special purpose entity  or qspe  in the form of a limited liability company 
the qspe raised funds by issuing debt to third party investors 
the qspe held trade accounts receivable whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the liabilities of the qspe 
investors only had recourse to the assets held by the qspe 
our involvement in these arrangements takes the form of originating accounts receivable and providing servicing activities

index to financial statements in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset 
the concept of a qspe entity  which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers  is removed by this standard 
this guidance was effective for us as of january  as a result of the adoption of such guidance  we consolidated the qspe and the securitization of accounts receivable related to the qspe is accounted for as a secured borrowing rather than as a sale 
accordingly  we record accounts receivable and short term debt related to the securitization facilities as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
in addition  our statements of income no longer include securitization activities in revenue 
rather  we report provision for bad debts and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued by the qspe in processing expense and interest expense  net  respectively  on the consolidated statements of income 
as a result of the implementation of this guidance  effective january   we recorded a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in current liabilities

at december   cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested is million 
all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries  excluding restricted cash  are available for general corporate purposes 
our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth  to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time 
we currently believe that funds generated from our us operations  along with potential borrowing capabilities in the us will be sufficient to fund our us operations for the foreseeable future  and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our us operations 
however  if at a future date or time these funds are needed for our operations in the us or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds  we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds

we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants within seven days of receiving the merchant billing 
as a result  we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances 
these balances are primarily composed of charge balances  which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly  semimonthly or monthly basis  and are generally required to be paid within days of billing 
we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes or for acquisitions 
at december   we had the ability to generate approximately million of additional liquidity under our securitization facility 
on november   we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement to add an additional term loan of million and increase the borrowing limit on the revolving line of credit million 
in addition  we increased the accordion feature from million to million 
as amended  the credit agreement provides for a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
the second amendment to the credit facility provides million of additional liquidity  which when combined with the availability under the credit facility at december   provides us with total liquidity under the credit facility of approximately billion 
we anticipate using the increased facility primarily to help fund future acquisitions  for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including to potentially fund share repurchases from certain of our significant legacy investors 
at december   we had approximately million undrawn on our revolving credit facility 
based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions  we believe that our current cash balances  our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations  will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations  commitments  capital requirements and acquisitions  and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future  either through the issuance of debt or equity securities

critical accounting policies and estimates in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
in many instances  however  we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and  in other instances  changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or

index to financial statements results of operations 
we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and presentation revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as from customers and partners 
we recognize revenue on fees generated through services to commercial fleets  major oil companies and petroleum marketers and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following i we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the acceptability of the product  ii we have no inventory risk  do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the product or have any involvement in the product specifications  iii we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for the product predominantly fuel and iv the amount we earn for our services is fixed 
through our merchant and network relationships we primarily provide fuel  prepaid cards  vehicle maintenance or lodging services to our customers 
we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction 
our net revenue consists of margin on fuel sales and fees for technical support  processing  communications and reporting 
the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup  ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount  or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit 
the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as expense when the fuel purchase transaction is executed 
we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have entered into agreements with major oil companies and petroleum marketers that specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records 
we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees  card fees  network fees  report fees and other transaction based fees which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed  number of transactions processed  or some combination thereof 
such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of third party networks 
transaction fees and other transaction based fees generated from our proprietary networks and third party networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured 
card fees  network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations 
in addition  we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges 
such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts  at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed 
we also charge our customers fees to load value onto prepaid fuel and food vouchers and cards 
we recognize fee revenue upon providing the activated fuel and food vouchers and prepaid cards to the customer 
revenue is recognized from the processing arrangements with merchants when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized on lodging and transportation management services when the lodging stay or transportation service is completed 
revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment in certain of our businesses  which is recognized at the time the device is sold and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed 
this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues  net within the consolidated statements of income 
the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within processing expenses 
we have recorded million of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income in

accounts receivable as described above under the heading securitization facility  we maintain a million revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility 
pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility  we transfer certain of our domestic receivables  on a evolving basis  to fleetcor funding llc  funding a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary conduit 
in turn  funding sells  without recourse  on a revolving basis  up to million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multi seller  asset backed commercial paper conduit 
funding maintains a subordinated interest  in the form of over collateralization  in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit 
purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper 
on february   we extended the term of the securitization facility to february  we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt  effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs 
we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions at market rates  which approximates our cost of servicing 
we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement 
the residual interest s fair value approximates carrying value due to its short term nature 
funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable  subject to a maximum amount 
prior to the adoption of new accounting guidance on january   unding retained a residual interest in the eligible receivables transferred  such that amounts payable in respect of such residual interest will be distributed to funding upon payment in full of all amounts owed by funding to the financial institutions 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset 
the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers  was removed by this guidance 
in addition  the guidance also shifts the determination of which enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity vie to a current control approach  such that an entity that has both the power to make decisions and the right to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie will consolidate a vie 
the guidance also requires ongoing assessments related to who should consolidate the vie 
this guidance was effective as of january  we analyzed the impact of the changes to the accounting guidance and concluded that it would consolidate funding 
we concluded it would consolidate this vie because we maintain significant decision making rights  own a variable interest that could be potentially significant to the vie  and receive all the benefits or is required to absorb all the losses of funding 
accordingly  effective january   we consolidated funding 
using the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of funding as prescribed by the accounting guidance and any corresponding elimination of activity between funding and us resulting from the consolidation on january   we recorded a million increase in total assets  a million increase in total liabilities and non cash financing activities of million 
beginning january   our consolidated balance sheet and statement of income no longer reflect activity related to our retained residual interest in eligible accounts receivable sold to funding  but instead reflect activity related to our securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt  including interest income  fees generated from late payments  provision for losses on accounts receivable  and interest expense 
interest expense and the provision for losses on accounts receivable associated with the securitized accounts receivable are no longer included as a deduction from revenues  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the cash flows from borrowings and repayments  associated with the securitized debt  are presented as cash flows from financing activities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements on february   we extended the term of the securitization facility to february  we capitalized million in deferred financing fees in connection with this extension 
all foreign receivables are owned receivables and are not included in our receivable securitization program 
at december  and  there was million and million  respectively  of short term debt outstanding under our securitization facility 
credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers 
payments from customers are generally due within days of billing 
we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances 
accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible and removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a third party collection agency 
recoveries from the third party collection agency are not significant 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we test our other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance 
we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present 
these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
if impairment indicators are present  we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets 
the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount 
the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses  working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  we determine the assets fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
generally  we perform our testing of the asset group at the business line level  as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 
we complete an asset impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  and the impairment test consists of two steps  as well as a qualitative assessment  as appropriate 
we have performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units 
in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate the macroeconomic conditions  including any deterioration of general conditions  limitations on accessing capital  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets  industry and market conditions  including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates  increased competition  changes in the products services and regulator and political developments  cost of doing business  overall financial performance  including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods  other relevant reporting unit specific facts  such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation  events affecting the reporting unit  including changes in the carrying value of net assets  likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business  the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers  and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step test from the prior year  updated with current year results  weighted average cost of capital rates and future projections 
we completed step of the goodwill impairment testing for certain of our reporting units 
in this first step the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon  among other factors  a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies 
if 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed 
step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangibles as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management s expectations for future revenue  operating expenses  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate 
we discount the related cash flow forecasts using our estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation 
the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate 
multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies  based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace  to various measures of their earnings and cash flow 
such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate 
preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions 
significant changes in our forecasts  the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
based on the goodwill asset impairment test on october   we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value 
no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we also evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually 
we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount 
estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate  royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names  projected average revenue growth and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with relevant authoritative literature 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 
we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with authoritative literature 
we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income taxes payable and income tax expense 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature 
if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states  or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  additional tax provisions may be required 
current guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under the relevant authoritative literature  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a percent likelihood of being sustained 
business combinations we have accounted for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies  be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income 
for significant acquisitions  we obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist in determining fair value 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded 
the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction 
these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when  and if  information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition 
to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period  the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted 
should information become available after the allocation period  those items are adjusted through operating results 
the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses 
certain acquisitions include additional contingent consideration related to future earn outs based on the growth of the market 
contingent earn outs are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition  with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature 
stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors 
options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years 
stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model for estimating the grand date fair value of stock option awards granted 
we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options 
we base the risk free interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant 
prior to july  due to the limited time we had been public  we estimated the volatility of the share price of our common stock by considering the historical volatility of the stock of similar public entities 
in determining the appropriateness of the public entities included in the volatility assumption we considered a number of factors  including the entity s life cycle stage  size  financial leverage  and products offered 
beginning july   we began utilizing the volatility of the share price of our common stock to estimate the volatility assumption for the black scholes option pricing model 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

table of contents 
index to financial statements awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting 
prior to our initial public offering  the vesting of the shares granted in were contingent on the sale of our company or a public offering of our common stock  subject to certain other conditions 
the vesting of the shares granted in and beyond are generally based on the passage of time  performance or market conditions 
shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years 
the fair value of restricted stock shares based on performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock 
the fair value of restricted stock shares based on market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo option pricing model 
the risk free interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo option pricing model are calculated consistently with those applied in the black scholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards 
for performance based restricted stock awards  we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
adoption of new accounting standards fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which amends accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurement to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this update explain how to measure fair value 
they do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
the amendments were effective for and adopted by us on january  and are required to be applied prospectively 
since asu is a disclosure only standard  our adoption of this asu did not affect our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
other comprehensive income reclassifications in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which supersedes certain pending paragraphs in asu asu defers the requirement of asu requiring entities to present reclassification adjustments by component in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements 
asu was effective for and adopted by us beginning january  our adoption of this asu did not affect our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
qualitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other  which gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the proposed guidance is similar to asu for goodwill 
companies would consider relevant events and circumstances that may affect the significant inputs used in determining the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset 
a company that concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an asset exceeds its carrying amount would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset in the current year 
however  if a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired  it must calculate the fair value of the asset and compare that value with its carrying amount  as is required by current guidance 
asu would be applied prospectively for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
our adoption of this asu is not expected to affect our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci asu 
under asu  an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
asu is effective for us on january  contractual obligations the table below summarizes the estimated dollar amounts of payments under contractual obligations identified below as of december  for the periods specified payments due by period a in millions total less than year years years more than years operating leases credit facility other debt securitization facility total a deferred income tax liabilities as of december  were approximately million 
refer to note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  as this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
management s use of non gaap financial measures we have included in the discussion under the caption adjusted revenues  ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap

adjusted revenues we have defined the non gaap measure adjusted revenues as revenues  net less merchant commissions as reflected in our income statement 
we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues  net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs 
the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate 
we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis

index to financial statements adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share we have defined the non gaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our income statement  adjusted to eliminate a non cash stock based compensation expense related share based compensation awards  b amortization of deferred financing costs and intangible assets  c amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables  and d loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
we have defined the non gaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our income statement 
we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance 
we believe it is useful to exclude non cash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because non cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance 
we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods  the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets  their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired 
therefore  we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income 
we also exclude loss on the early extinguishment of debt from adjusted net income  as this expense is non cash and is one time in nature and does not reflect the ongoing operations of the business 
we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis

quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
revenue from our international segment was  and of total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates 
exchange rates and currency positions as of december  were used to perform the sensitivity analysis 
such analysis indicated that a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december  by approximately million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure 
when exchange rates and currency positions as of december  and were used to perform this sensitivity analysis  the analysis indicated that a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated pretax income for the years ended december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt 
we invest our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
under our new credit facility  we have a syndicated million term loan agreement with a syndicate of term loan b investors in the united states  as well as a million revolving credit facility 
interest on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest  at our election  at the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate  plus a margin based on a leverage ratio  or at our option  the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the prime rate announced by bank of america  na  or c the eurocurrency rate plus plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 
prior to entering into our new credit facility  we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the ccs credit facility 
on june   proceeds from our new credit facility were used to retire our existing indebtedness under the credit facility and the ccs credit facility 
under the credit facility  we had a syndicated million term loan agreement with a syndicate of term loan b investors in the united states 
the term loan bore interest  at our election  at the prime rate or libor plus a margin based on our leverage position 
under the credit facility  we also had a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks based in the united states and europe 
borrowings bore a variable interest rate based at the prime rate or libor plus a margin that varied according to our leverage position 
in addition  we had an million term loan under our ccs credit facility 
this term loan bore interest on a base rate  pribor  plus a margin and mandatory cost 
based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december  and  if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of basis points  our interest expense would have changed by million in each year 
we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreement 
these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment

index to financial statements fuel price risk our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel 
accordingly  our revenue is affected by fuel prices  which are subject to significant volatility 
a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources  including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer s total purchase 
changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts 
the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants  where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price 
we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 
fuel price spread risk from our merchant and network relationships  we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction 
the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup 
the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including  among others  the factors described above affecting fuel prices 
the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including  among others  the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant  posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices 
we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers  or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant s wholesale cost of fuel 
accordingly  if fuel price spreads contract  we may generate less revenue  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants  where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price
