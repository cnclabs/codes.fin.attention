item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil  gas and hydrocarbon liquids and plan to grow through exploration  exploitation and industry standard enhanced oil recovery projects 
as of december   we estimated net proved reserves were approximately mmboe  of which approximately were proved developed producing reserves and approximately were oil 
the standardized measure of our estimated net proved reserves as of december  was million 
we focused our efforts on increasing reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
our future earnings and cash flow from existing operations are dependent on a variety of factors including commodity prices  exploitation and recovery activities and our ability to manage our overall cost structure at a level that allows for profitable operation 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our operating performance  including but not limited to  production levels  pricing and cost trends  reserve trends  operating and general and administrative expenses  operating cash flow and adjusted ebitda defined below 
production levels  trends and prices 
oil and gas revenue is the product of our production multiplied by the price that we receive for that production 
because the price that we receive is highly dependent on many factors outside of our control  except to the extent that we have entered into derivative arrangements that can influence our net price either positively or negatively  production is the primary revenue driver over which we have some influence 
although we cannot greatly alter reservoir performance  we can aggressively implement exploitation activities that can increase production or diminish production declines relative to what would have been the case without intervention 
examples of activities that can positively influence production include minimizing production downtime due to equipment malfunction  well workovers and cleanouts  recompletions of existing wells in new parts of the reservoir and expanded secondary and tertiary recovery programs 
the price of oil has been extremely volatile  and we expect that volatility to continue 
given the inherent volatility of oil prices  we plan our activities and budget based on sales price assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
we use derivative contracts to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and currently have such contracts in place through these instruments limit our exposure to declines in prices  but also limit our ability to receive the benefit of price increases 
changes in the price of oil or gas will result in the recognition of a non cash gain or loss recorded in other income or expense due to changes in the future fair value of the derivative contracts 
recognized gains or losses only arise from payments made or received on monthly settlements of derivative contracts or if a derivative contract is terminated prior to its expiration 
we typically enter into derivative contracts that cover a significant portion of our estimated future oil and gas production 
reserve trends 
from inception  we have grown our reserve base through a focused acquisition strategy 
we acquired the majority of our aneth field properties through two significant purchases from chevron and exxonmobil in november and april  respectively 
we acquired our wyoming properties in july  our bakken properties in and  our permian properties in and and denbury s interest in the aneth field properties in we plan to continue to seek opportunities to acquire similar producing properties that have upside potential through low risk development drilling and exploitation projects  and believe that our knowledge of various domestic onshore operating areas  strong management and staff and solid industry relationships will allow us to locate  capitalize on and integrate strategic acquisition opportunities 
at december   we have estimated net proved reserves of approximately mmboe that were classified as proved developed non producing and proved undeveloped 
an estimated mmboe  or  of those reserves are attributable to recoveries associated with expansions  extensions and processing of the tertiary recovery co floods that are in operation on the aneth field properties 
we believe that the expenditures associated with the co floods will result in significant increases in aneth field oil and gas production 
operating expenses 
operating expenses consist of costs associated with the operation of oil and gas properties and production and ad valorem taxes 
direct labor  repair and maintenance  workovers  utilities  disposal activities  fluids and chemicals and contract services comprise the most significant portion of lease operating expenses 
we monitor our operating expenses in relation to production amounts and the number of wells operated 
some of these expenses are relatively independent of the volume of hydrocarbons produced  but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
other expenses  such as taxes and utility costs  are more directly related to production volumes or reserves 
severance taxes  for example  are charged based on production revenue and therefore are based on the product of the volumes that are sold and the related price received 
ad valorem taxes are generally based on the value of reserves 
because we operate on the navajo reservation  we also pay a possessory interest tax  which is effectively an ad valorem tax assessed by the navajo nation 
our largest utility expense is for electricity that is used primarily to power the pumps in producing wells and the compressors behind the injection wells 
the more fluid that is moved  the greater the amount of electricity that is consumed 
higher oil prices can lead to higher demand for drilling rigs  workover rigs  operating personnel and field supplies and services  which in turn can increase the costs of those goods and services 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
we monitor our general and administrative expenses carefully  attempting to balance costs against the benefits of  among other things  hiring and retaining highly qualified staff who can add value to our asset base 
general and administrative expenses include  among other things  salaries and benefits  share based compensation  general corporate overhead  fees paid to independent auditors  lawyers  petroleum engineers and other professional advisors  costs associated with shareholder reports  investor relations activities  registrar and transfer agent fees  director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation 
operating cash flow 
operating cash flow is the cash directly derived from our oil and gas properties  before considering such things as administrative expenses and interest costs 
operating cash flow per unit of production is a measure of field efficiency  and can be compared to results obtained by operators of oil and gas properties with characteristics similar to ours in order to evaluate relative performance 
aggregate operating cash flow is a measure of our ability to sustain overhead expenses and costs related to capital structure  including interest expenses 
adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure as consolidated net income adjusted to exclude interest expense  interest income  income taxes  depletion  depreciation and amortization  impairment expense  accretion of asset retirement obligation  change in fair value of derivative instruments  early settlement of derivative instruments  non cash share based compensation expense and noncontrolling interest amounts 
adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that we report to our lenders and is used as a gauge for compliance with some of the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility 
adjusted ebitda is also used as a supplemental liquidity or performance measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others  to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  the financial metrics that support our indebtedness  our ability to finance capital expenditures  financial performance of the assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the exploration and production industry  without regard to financing methods or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap as measures of operating performance  liquidity or ability to service debt obligations 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate gross margins 
because we use capital assets  depletion  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is important to consider both net income and net cash provided by operating activities determined under gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  when evaluating our financial performance and liquidity 
adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  operating income and net cash provided by operating activities and these measures may vary among companies 
our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda of any other company because other entities may not calculate adjusted ebitda in the same manner 
factors that significantly affect our financial results revenue  cash flow from operations and future growth depend on many factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
historical oil prices have been volatile and are expected to fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and our ability to obtain capital 

table of contents like all businesses engaged in the exploration for and production of oil and gas  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
as initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil and gas production from a given well decreases 
thus  an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or gas it produces 
we attempted to overcome this natural decline by developing existing properties  implementing secondary and tertiary recovery techniques and by acquiring more reserves than we produced 
our future growth will depend on our ability to enhance production levels from existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production through exploration  development and acquisition 
we will maintain our focus on costs necessary to produce our reserves as well as the costs necessary to add reserves through production enhancement  drilling and acquisitions 
our ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from existing reserves and to acquire more reserves is dependent on availability of capital resources  and can be limited by many factors  including the ability to obtain capital in a cost effective manner and to obtain permits and regulatory approvals in a timely manner

revenue from oil and gas activities increased to million during  from million during the million increase in revenue was attributable to million in increased production  offset by million in commodity price decreases per boe in versus per boe in 
sales volumes in increased as compared to  from  mboe to  mboe  primarily as a result of increased production from the bakken and permian properties due to a higher number of producing wells compared to and additional production in aneth field resulting from increased co flood response and workover activity 
operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased to million during  from million during the million  or  increase was due to expanded operations in the bakken and permian properties  increased repair and workover activity in aneth field to restore wells to production and the expense attributable to the additional working interests in aneth field purchased from denbury 
on a unit of production basis  lease operating expense increased from per boe in to per boe in production and ad valorem taxes increased by to million during  versus million during  mainly due to the increase in production during production and ad valorem taxes were of total revenue in and depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion expenses increased to million during  as compared to million during the million  or  increase is principally due a higher depletable base  higher finding costs and increased production in pursuant to full cost accounting rules  we perform ceiling tests each quarter on our proved oil and gas assets 
no provision for impairment was recorded in or 
table of contents general and administrative expenses increased to million during  as compared to million during the million  or  increase resulted from increased salaries and wages associated with expanded operations  increased share based compensation expense and professional service fees  offset by increased overhead billings and capitalized expense

all oil and gas derivative instruments are accounted for under mark to market accounting rules  which provide for the fair value of the contracts to be reflected as either an asset or a liability on the balance sheet 
the change in the fair value during an accounting period is reflected in the income statement for that period 
during  the realized and unrealized gains on our oil and gas derivatives totaled million 
this amount included million of realized losses  including million of partial terminations of certain derivative contracts  offset by million of increases in the unrealized fair value of oil and gas derivatives 
during  the realized and unrealized losses on oil and gas derivatives totaled million  including million of realized losses in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives  of which million was related to partial terminations of certain derivative contracts  offset by million of unrealized gains 
interest expense was million during as compared to million during the million  or  increase is attributable to the issuance in of our senior notes  which carry a significantly higher interest rate than that of our credit facility debt outstanding during  and to a higher average debt balance during income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense recognized during was million  or of income before income taxes  as compared to income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes in the increase in the effective tax rate over is the result of permanent differences related to share based compensation 
income tax expense differs from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to state income taxes and estimated permanent differences 
we carried a million current deferred tax asset at december   for which no valuation allowance was recorded as it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized due to projected future taxable income 
year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue 
revenue from oil and gas activities increased to million during  from million during of the million increase in revenue  approximately million was attributable to higher commodity prices  while million was attributable to increased production 
average sales price  excluding derivative settlements  increased from per boe in to per boe in  primarily as a function of increased commodity pricing 
sales volumes increased during as compared to  from  mboe to  mboe 
the well recompletion program and increased response from the company s co flood projects in the aneth field properties were the primary drivers of the production increase 
the additional increase was due to production related to the bakken properties  although we did not begin drilling activities in north dakota until the end of the third quarter of  and production attributable to the permian properties beginning in august operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased to million during  from million during  a portion of which was due to expanded operations in new areas 
the million  or  increase was primarily attributable to million in increased equipment  maintenance and supplies  million in increased utilities and fuel due to increased compression capability and additional fuel purchases in the aneth field properties  and million in increased labor costs

no provision for impairment was recorded in or general and administrative expenses increased to million during  as compared to million during the million  or  increase resulted from a million increase in salaries and wages due to additional hiring to meet the demands of increased operations and million of increased share based compensation expense related to additional restricted stock grants awarded to employees in these increases were offset by decreased professional service fees  a significant portion of which were charges associated with the implementation of the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 

table of contents other income expense 
all oil and gas derivative instruments are accounted for under mark to market accounting rules  which provide for the fair value of the contracts to be reflected as either an asset or a liability on the balance sheet 
the change in the fair value during an accounting period is reflected in the income statement for that period

this amount included approximately million of realized losses  including million of partial terminations of certain derivative contracts  offset by million of increases in the unrealized fair value of oil and gas derivatives 
during  the realized and unrealized losses on oil and gas derivatives totaled million and included approximately million of unrealized losses in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives and million of realized losses from monthly settlements 
interest expense was million during  as compared to million during the million  or  decrease is attributable to lower interest rates  a lower average debt balance and higher interest capitalization during income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense recognized during was million  or of income before income taxes  as compared to income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes in the change in the effective rate reflects changes in permanent differences and revisions in to prior year estimates as a result of final income tax return filings 
income tax expense differs from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to state income taxes and estimated permanent differences 
we expect income taxes to be between and of income loss before income taxes in future years 
we carried a million current deferred tax asset at december   for which no valuation allowance was recorded as it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized due to projected future taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from operations  amounts available under our credit facility  proceeds from warrant exercises  proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
for purposes of management s discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources  management has analyzed our cash flows and capital resources for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities during was million  as compared to million during and million during the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily due to changes in working capital and increased interest expense resulting from our senior notes  partially offset by increased production 
the increase in over was primarily due to higher commodity prices and production volumes and changes in working capital in we plan to reinvest a sufficient amount of our cash flow in our development operations in order to maintain our production over the long term  and plans to use external financing sources as well as cash flow from operations and cash reserves to increase our production 
net cash used in investing activities was million during as compared to million during and million during the primary investing activity in was cash used for capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures consisted of million paid to acquire the new permian properties  million paid for the denbury acquisition  million in compression  facility and drilling projects in aneth field  million in co acquisition  million in drilling activities and infrastructure projects in the permian basin  million in drilling and completion activities in the bakken properties and million in recompletion and drilling activities in our wyoming properties 
a portion of these capital costs are accrued and not paid at period end 
capital divestitures include million received from nnogc for the sale of certain working interests in the aneth field properties 
the primary investing activity in was cash used for capital expenditures of million  consisting of million of acquisition  exploration and development expenditures and million in purchases of proved oil and gas properties 
the capital expenditures were comprised of million in compression and facility related projects  million in co acquisition  million in acquisition and leasehold costs and million in drilling activities in the permian basin  million in drilling and completion activities in the bakken properties and million in recompletion and drilling activities in our wyoming properties 
a portion of these capital costs are accrued and not paid at year end 
the primary investing activity in was capital expenditures of million 
the capital expenditures were comprised of million in leasehold and exploratory costs in north dakota  million in co acquisition and million in other capital expenditures 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to million in and million in the primary financing activities in were million in proceeds received from the issuance of the senior notes  partially offset by million in net payments under the credit facility and million paid to retire a portion of our warrants 
primary financing activities in were million in proceeds received from warrants exercised and million in net borrowings under the credit facility 
primary financing activities in were million in net borrowings under the credit facility and million in deferred financing costs related to the amended credit agreement entered into on march  we are unable to predict the amount or timing of future warrant exercises 
if cash flow from operating activities does not meet expectations  we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures and or fund a portion of our capital expenditures using borrowings under our credit facility  issuances of debt and equity securities or from other sources  such as asset sales 
we have in place an effective shelf registration pursuant to which an aggregate of million of any such equity or debt securities could be issued 
there can be no assurance that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness could be limited by the covenants in our credit facility or our senior notes 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to maintain production or proved reserves 
we believe that there remain several more years of drilling and development opportunity in the bakken properties  and that these opportunities have strong economic return potential 
however  in light of the recent permian acquisitions  we believe it is prudent to consider monetizing our bakken properties 
as a result  we have engaged the services of an advisor to explore this possibility 
we plan to continue our practice of hedging a significant portion of our production through the use of various derivative transactions 
our existing derivative transactions do not qualify as cash flow hedges  and we anticipate that future transactions will receive similar accounting treatment 
derivative settlements usually occur within five days of the end of the month 
as is typical in the oil and gas industry  however  we do not generally receive the proceeds from the sale of our oil production until the th day of the month following the month of production 
as a result  when commodity prices increase above the fixed price in the derivative contacts  we will be required to pay the derivative counterparty the difference between the fixed price in the derivative contract and the market price before receiving the proceeds from the sale of the hedged production 
if this occurs  we may use working capital or borrowings under the credit facility to fund our operations 
revolving credit facility our credit facility is with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank  national association the credit facility with the company as the borrower 
the credit facility specifies a maximum borrowing base as determined by the lenders 
the determination of the borrowing base takes into consideration the estimated value of our oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
the borrowing base is redetermined semi annually  and the amount available for borrowing could be increased or decreased as a result of such redeterminations 
under certain circumstances  either the company or the lenders may request an interim redetermination 
in april  we entered into the third amendment to the amended and restated credit facility agreement which increased the size of the revolving credit facility from million to billion 
in addition  under the terms of the amendment  at our option  the credit facility accrues interest at either a the london interbank offered rate  plus a margin which varies from to or b the alternative base rate defined as the greater of i the administrative agent s prime rate ii the federal funds effective rate plus or iii an adjusted london interbank rate plus a margin which ranges from to 
each such margin is based on the level of utilization under the borrowing base 
the third amendment also extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to april in connection with the third amendment  the semi annual redetermination of the borrowing base was completed  confirming the borrowing base at million 
in december  we entered into the fifth amendment to the amended and restated credit facility agreement which increased our maximum leverage ratio for the fourth quarter of additionally  we are currently in discussions with our bank syndicate to amend the credit facility in order to fund the purchase of the option properties 
as of december   outstanding borrowings were million under the borrowing base of million 
the borrowing base availability had been reduced by million in conjunction with letters of credit issued to vendors at december   and other limitations based upon a multiple of trailing adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit facility 
to the extent that the borrowing base  as adjusted from time to time  exceeds the outstanding balance  no repayments of principal are required prior to maturity 
the credit facility is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and is collateralized by substantially all of the proved oil and gas assets of resolute aneth  llc and resolute wyoming  inc  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance under the credit facility was 
the recorded value of the credit facility approximates its fair market value because the interest rate of the credit facility is variable over the term of the loan see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the credit facility includes terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  the payment of dividends  and require satisfaction of certain financial tests 
we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the credit facility at december  resolute energy corporation  the stand alone parent entity  has insignificant independent assets and no operations 
there are no restrictions on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other distributions of funds from our subsidiaries  except those imposed by applicable law 
senior notes in april  we consummated a private placement of senior notes with a principal amount of million  and a follow on issuance of senior notes with a principal amount of million the senior notes 
the senior notes are due may   and bear an annual interest rate of with the interest on the notes is payable semiannually in cash on may and november of each year  beginning november  we used the million of proceeds from the may issuance to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  with the remainder reserved for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
we used the million of proceeds from the december issuance to partially finance the permian acquisitions 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture the indenture among the company  our existing subsidiaries the guarantors and us bank national association  as trustee the trustee in a private transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the securities act of the indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  limit our and the guarantors ability to make investments  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  create liens  sell assets  enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  engage in transactions with our affiliates  pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness and create unrestricted subsidiaries 
the indenture also contains customary events of default 
upon occurrence of events of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency  the senior notes shall become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act of the trustee or the holders of the senior notes 
upon the occurrence of certain other events of default  the trustee or the holders of the senior notes may declare all outstanding senior notes to be due and payable immediately 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our senior notes as of december  the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company and guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the guarantors 
the senior notes rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company  will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior secured indebtedness of the guarantors  will rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the company and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the guarantors on a senior basis 
the senior notes are redeemable by us on or after may   on not less than or more than days prior notice  at redemption prices set forth in the indenture 
in addition  at any time prior to may   we may use the net proceeds from equity offerings and warrant exercises to redeem up to of the principal amount of notes issued under the indenture at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the senior notes may also be redeemed at any time prior to may   at the option of the company at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the applicable premium  and accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any  to the applicable redemption date as set forth in the indenture 
if a change of control occurs  each holder of the notes will have the right to require that we purchase all of such holder s notes in an amount equal to of the principal of such notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of the purchase 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets

purchase contracts 
for purposes of calculating the future purchase obligation under these contracts  we have assumed the purchase price over the term of the contract was the price in effect as of december  total contractually obligated payment commitments do not include the anticipated settlement of derivative contracts  obligations to taxing authorities or amounts relating to our asset retirement obligations  which include plugging and abandonment obligations  due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement amounts and timing of these obligations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the application of accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ  perhaps materially  from these estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
provided below is an expanded discussion of our most significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the financial statements 
oil and gas properties 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties  including costs of unsuccessful exploration  costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals and the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment activities  improved recovery systems and a portion of general and administrative and operating expenses are capitalized on a country wide basis the cost center 
we conduct tertiary recovery projects on a portion of our oil and gas properties in order to recover additional hydrocarbons that are not recoverable from primary or secondary recovery methods 
under the full cost method  all development costs are capitalized at the time incurred 
development costs include charges associated with access to and preparation of well locations  drilling and equipping development wells  test wells  and service wells including injection wells  acquiring  constructing  and installing production facilities and providing for improved recovery systems 
improved recovery systems include all related facility development costs and the cost of the acquisition of tertiary injectants  primarily purchased co the development cost related to co purchases are incurred solely for the purpose of gaining access to incremental reserves not otherwise recoverable 
the accumulation of injected co  in combination with additional purchased and recycled co  provide future economic value over the life of the project 

table of contents in contrast  other costs related to the daily operation of the improved recovery systems are considered production costs and are expensed as incurred 
these costs include  but are not limited to  costs incurred to maintain reservoir pressure  compression  electricity  separation  and re injection of recovered co and water 
capitalized general and administrative and operating costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other specifically identifiable capital costs and do not include costs related to production operations  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted  pending determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are periodically evaluated for impairment 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment when it is not practicable to assess the amount of impairment of properties on an individual basis 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized  or is reported as a period expense as appropriate 
pursuant to full cost accounting rules  we must perform a ceiling test each quarter on our proved oil and gas assets 
the ceiling test provides that capitalized costs less related accumulated depletion and deferred income taxes for each cost center may not exceed the sum of the present value of future net revenue from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves using current prices  excluding the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  and a discount factor of  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less income tax effects related to differences in the book and tax basis of oil and gas properties 
should the net capitalized costs for a cost center exceed the sum of the components noted above  an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent of the excess capitalized costs 
no gain or loss is recognized upon the sale or abandonment of undeveloped or producing oil and gas properties unless the sale represents a significant portion of oil and gas properties and the gain significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil reserves of the cost center 
depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties is computed on the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
amortizable costs include estimates of asset retirement obligations and future development costs of proved reserves  including  but not limited to  costs to drill and equip development wells  constructing and installing production and processing facilities  and improved recovery systems including the cost of required future co purchases 
oil and gas reserve quantities 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows affect our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserves estimates 
we prepare reserves estimates  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserves estimates  in accordance with sec and fasb guidelines 
the accuracy of our reserves estimates is a function of many factors including but not limited to the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
our proved reserves estimates are a function of many assumptions  any or all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserves estimates may vary materially from the ultimate quantities of oil  gas and ngl eventually recovered 
derivative instruments 
we enter into derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility and these contracts may take the form of swaps  puts  calls  collars and other such arrangements 
derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
we have not elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting  and consequently  recognize gains and losses in earnings rather than deferring such amounts in other comprehensive income as allowed under cash flow hedge accounting 
realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are recognized in the period in which the related contract is settled 
both the realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments are reflected in other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
cash flows from derivatives are reported as cash flows from operating activities 
asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations relate to future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells  removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition 
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location  and the cost of such liability increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by the same amount 
the liability is accreted each period and the capitalized cost is depleted on a units of production basis as part of the full cost pool 
revisions to estimated retirement obligations result in adjustments to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability 

table of contents our estimated asset retirement obligation liability is based on estimated economic lives  estimates as to the cost to abandon the wells in the future  and federal and state regulatory requirements 
the liability is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate estimated at the time the liability is incurred or revised 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimated abandonment costs or well economic lives  or if federal or state regulators enact new requirements regarding the abandonment of wells 
business combinations 
we account for all business combinations using the acquisition method which involves the use of significant judgment 
under the acquisition method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration given 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based on these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquisition  if any  over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquisition  if any  is recognized immediately in earnings as a gain 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment since fair values are not always readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and the present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
share based compensation 
share based compensation expense is measured at the estimated grant date fair value of the awards and is amortized over the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
we estimate forfeitures in calculating the cost related to share based compensation as opposed to recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur 
revenue recognition 
oil and gas revenue is recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and the collectability of the revenue is probable 
oil and gas revenue is recorded using the sales method 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns 
the ability to realize the deferred tax assets is routinely assessed 
if the conclusion is that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
the future taxable income is considered when making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
income tax positions are also required to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 

table of contents item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and derivative arrangements our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to oil and gas production 
realized pricing on our unhedged volumes of production is primarily driven by the spot market prices applicable to oil production and the prevailing price for gas 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for unhedged production depend on many factors outside of our control 
we employ derivative instruments such as swaps  puts  calls  collars and other such agreements 
the purpose of these instruments is to manage our exposure to commodity price risk in order to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices 
under the terms of our credit agreement the form of derivative instruments to be entered into is at our discretion  not to exceed i of our anticipated production from proved properties in the next two years and ii the greater of of our anticipated production from proved properties or of our anticipated production from proved developed producing properties utilizing economic parameters specified in our credit agreement  including escalated prices and costs 
by removing the price volatility from a significant portion of our oil and gas production  we have mitigated  but not eliminated  the potential effects of volatile prices on cash flow from operations for the periods hedged 
while mitigating negative effects of falling commodity prices  certain of these derivative contracts also limit the benefits we would receive from increases in commodity prices 
it is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are major  creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers

derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
we mark our derivative instruments to fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and recognize the changes in fair market value in earnings 
at december   the fair value of our commodity derivatives was a net liability of million 
interest rate risk at december   we had million of outstanding debt under the credit facility 
interest is calculated under the terms of the agreement based on a libor spread 
a increase in libor would result in an estimated million increase in annual interest expense 
we do not currently have or intend to enter into any derivative arrangements to protect against fluctuations in interest rates applicable to our outstanding indebtedness 
credit risk and contingent features in derivative instruments we are exposed to credit risk to the extent of nonperformance by the counterparties in the derivative contracts discussed above 
all counterparties are also lenders under our credit facility 
for these contracts  we are not required to provide any credit support to our counterparties other than cross collateralization with the properties securing the credit facility 
our derivative contracts are documented with industry standard contracts known as a schedule to the master agreement and international swaps and derivative association  inc master agreement isda 
typical terms for the isdas include credit support requirements  cross default provisions  termination events  and set off provisions 
we have set off provisions with our lenders that  in the event of counterparty default  allow us to set off amounts owed under the credit facility or other general obligations against amounts owed for derivative contract liabilities
