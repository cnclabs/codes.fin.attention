item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview equus is a bdc that provides financing solutions for privately held middle market and small capitalization companies 
we began operations in and have been a publicly traded closed end fund since our investment objective is to seek the highest total return  consisting of capital appreciation and current income 
as a bdc  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of the fund s total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private us companies  certain public us companies with a total market capitalization not in excess of million  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and short term high quality debt investments 
equus is a ric under subchapter m of the code 
to qualify as a ric  we must meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements 
if we comply with the provisions of subchapter m  the fund generally does not have to pay corporate level income taxes on any income that distributed to our stockholders 
investment income 
we generate investment income from interest payable on the debt securities that the fund holds  dividends received on equity interests in our portfolio companies and capital gains  if any  realized upon sales of equity and  to a lesser extent  debt securities in the investment portfolio 
our equity investments may include shares of common and preferred stock  membership interests in limited liability companies and warrants to purchase additional equity interests 
these equity securities may or may not pay dividends  and the exercise prices of warrants that we acquire in connection with debt investments  if any  vary by investment 
our debt investments in portfolio companies may be in the form of senior or subordinated loans and may be unsecured or have a first or second lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower 
our loans typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at fixed or floating rates 
interest on these debt securities is generally payable either quarterly or semiannually 
some promissory notes held by the fund provide that a portfolio company may elect to pay interest in cash or provide that discount interest may accrete in the form of original issue discount or payment in kind pik over the life of the notes by adding unpaid interest amounts to the principal balance 
amortization of principal on our debt investments is generally deferred for several years from the date of initial investment 
the principal amount of these debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally will become due at maturity 
we also earn interest income at market rates on investments in short term marketable securities 
from time to time  we generate income from time to time in the form of commitment  origination and structuring fees in connection with our investments 
we recognize all such fees when earned 
expenses 
currently  our primary operating expenses include director fees and expenses  professional fees  compensation expense  and general and administrative fees 
during  we did not incur any non recurring expenses 
during  we incurred non recurring expenses  including settlement expenses  related to the various legal proceedings described in item above  of million  as well as offering costs of million 
during  professional fees and other expenses incidental to our annual meeting and proxy contest were million 
operating activities 
we use cash to make new investments and follow on investments in our existing portfolio companies 
we record these investments at cost on the applicable trade date 
realized gains or losses are computed using the specific identification method 
on an ongoing basis  we carry our investments in our financial statements at fair value  as determined by our board of directors 
see critical accounting policies valuation of investments below 
as of december   we had invested of our net assets in securities of portfolio companies that constituted qualifying investments under the act 
at that time  we had invested by value in shares of common stock  in membership interests in limited liability companies  and in various debt instruments 
under certain circumstances  we make follow on investments in some of our portfolio companies 
as of december   we had no outstanding commitments to our portfolio company investments 
financing activities 
from time to time  we use leverage to finance a portion of our investments 
we then repay such debt from the sale of portfolio securities 
under the act  we have the ability to borrow funds and issue debt securities or preferred stock that are referred to as senior securities  subject to certain restrictions including an overall limitation on the amount of outstanding debt  or leverage  relative to equity of because of the nature and size of our portfolio investments  we periodically borrow funds to make qualifying investments in order to maintain our qualification as a ric 
during and  we borrowed such funds by accessing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm 
we invest the proceeds of these margin loans in high quality securities such as us treasury securities until they are repaid 
we refer to these high quality investments as restricted assets because they are not generally available for investment in portfolio companies under the terms of borrowing 
if  in the future  we cannot borrow funds to make such qualifying investments at the end of any future quarter  we may not qualify as a ric and would become subject to corporate level income tax on our net investment income and realized capital gains  if any 
in addition  our distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary dividends to the extent paid from earnings and profits 
see federal income tax considerations 
distributions 
on march   we announced that we suspended our managed distribution policy and payment of quarterly distributions for an indefinite period  following the distribution of the first quarter dividend to be paid on march  as originally implemented  the policy provided for quarterly dividends at an annualized rate equal to of the fund s market value per share as at the end of the preceding calendar year 
we will continue to pay out net investment income and or realized capital gains  if any  on an annual basis as required under the act 
possible share repurchase 
as a closed end bdc  our shares of common stock are not redeemable at the option of stockholders  and our shares currently trade at a discount to their net asset value 
our board has determined that it would be in the best interests of our stockholders to reduce or eliminate this market value discount 
accordingly  we have been authorized to  and may from time to time  repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock including by means of tender offers or privately negotiated transactions in an effort to reduce or eliminate this market discount or to increase the net asset value of our shares 
we are not required to undertake any such share repurchases  nor do we anticipate taking such action in critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of investments portfolio investments are carried at fair value with the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
valuations of portfolio securities are performed in accordance with gaap and the financial reporting policies of the securities and exchange commission sec 
the applicable methods prescribed by such principles and policies are described below publicly traded portfolio securities investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded are generally valued at their quoted market price at the close of business on the valuation date 
privately held portfolio securities the fair value of investments for which no market exists is determined on the basis of procedures established in good faith by our board of directors 
as a general principle  the current fair value of an investment would be the amount we might reasonably expect to receive for it upon its current sale  in an orderly manner 
appraisal valuations are necessarily subjective and the estimated values arrived at by the fund may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of portfolio securities 
thinly traded and over the counter securities generally  we value securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange at the average of the prevailing bid and ask prices on the date of the relevant period end 
however  we may apply a discount to the market value of restricted or thinly traded public securities to reflect the impact that these restrictions have on the value of these securities 
we review factors  including the trading volume  total securities outstanding and our percentage ownership of securities to determine whether the trading levels are active level or inactive level or unobservable level 
as of december   these securities  consisting of our holdings in the new opg notes  represented of our investments in portfolio securities 
we utilized independent pricing services with certain of our fair value estimates 
to corroborate bid ask quotes from independent pricing services  we perform a market yield approach to validate prices obtained or obtain other evidence 
during the first twelve months after an investment is made  we rely on the original investment amount to determine the fair value unless significant developments have occurred during this month period which would indicate a material effect on the portfolio company such as results of operations or changes in general market conditions 
after the month period  or if material events have occurred within the twelve month period  we consider a two step process when appraising investments of privately held companies 
the first step involves determining the enterprise value of the portfolio company 
during this step  we consider three different valuation approaches a market approach  an income approach  and an asset approach 
the particular facts and circumstances of each portfolio company determine which approach  or combination of approaches  will be utilized 
the second step when appraising equity investments of privately held companies involves allocating value to the various debt and equity securities of the company 
we allocate value to these securities based on their relative priorities 
for equity securities such as warrants  we may also incorporate alternative methodologies including the black scholes option pricing model 
market approach the market approach typically employed by management calculates the enterprise value of a company as a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda generated by the company for the trailing twelve month period 
adjustments to the company s ebitda  including those for non recurring items  may be considered 
multiples are estimated based on current market conditions and past experience in the private company marketplace and are subjective in nature 
we will apply liquidity and other discounts it deems appropriate to equity valuations where applicable 
we may also use  when available  third party transactions in a portfolio company s securities as the basis of valuation the private market method 
the private market method will be used only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated  independent investors 
income approach the income approach typically utilized by management calculates the enterprise value of a company utilizing a discounted cash flow model incorporating projected future cash flows of the company 
projected future cash flows consider the historical performance of the company as well as current and projected market participant performance 
discount rates are estimated based on current market conditions and past experience in the private company marketplace and are subjective in nature 
we will apply liquidity and other discounts it deems appropriate to equity valuations where applicable 
asset approach we consider the asset approach to determine the fair value of significantly deteriorated investments demonstrating circumstances indicative of a liquidation analysis 
this situation may arise when a portfolio company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on its indebtedness  is not successful in refinancing the its debt upon maturity  we believe the credit quality of a loan has deteriorated due to changes in the business and underlying asset or market conditions may result in the company s inability to meet future obligations  or the portfolio company s reorganization or bankruptcy 
consideration is also given as to whether a liquidation event would be orderly or forced 
our general intent is to hold our loans to maturity when appraising our privately held debt investments 
as such  we believe that the fair value will not exceed the cost of the investment 
however  in addition to the previously described analysis involving allocation of value to the debt instrument  we perform a yield analysis to determine if a debt security has been impaired 
certificates of deposit purchased by the fund generally will be valued at their face value  plus interest accrued to the date of valuation 
the audit committee of the board of directors may engage independent  third party valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals and review management s preliminary valuations of each privately held investment that the fund a has held for more than one year and b holds on its books at a fair value of at least million in order to make their own independent assessment 
any third party valuation data would be considered as one of many factors in a fair value determination 
the audit committee then would recommend the fair values for all privately held securities based on all relevant factors to the board of directors for final approval 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation of portfolio securities which do not have readily ascertainable market values  amounting to million and million as of december  and  respectively  our fair value determinations may materially differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the securities 
as of december   one of our portfolio investments  consisting of  ordinary shares of opg  was publicly listed on the nyse euronext paris exchange  along with  in newly issued year opg notes 
as of december   we held  bonds due may issued by orco germany sa were publicly listed on the euro mtf market of the luxemburg stock exchange 
however  there had been no recent trading activity 
on a daily basis  we adjust our net asset value for the changes in the value of our publicly held securities  if applicable  and material changes in the value of private securities  generally determined on a quarterly basis or as announced in a press release  and reports those amounts to lipper analytical services  inc weekly and daily net asset values appear in various publications  including barron s and the wall street journal 
federal income taxes we intend to comply with the requirements of the code necessary for us to qualify as a ric 
so long as we comply with these requirements  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income including net realized capital gains distributed to stockholders 
therefore  we did not record a provision for federal income taxes in our financial statements 
as of december   we had a capital loss carry forward of million which may be used to offset future capital gains 
we may borrow money from time to time to maintain our status as a ric under the code 
see overview financing activities above 
interest income recognition we record interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
we stop accruing interest on investments when we determine that interest is no longer collectible 
we may also impair the accrued interest when we determine that all or a portion of the current accrual is uncollectible 
if we receive any cash after determining that interest is no longer collectible  we treat such cash as payment on the principal balance until the entire principal balance has been repaid  before we recognize any additional interest income 
we accrete or amortize discounts and premiums on securities purchased over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discount and or amortization of premium on debt securities 
payment in kind interest we have loans in our portfolio that may pay pik interest 
we add pik interest  if any  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain the fund s status as a ric  we must pay out to our stockholders this non cash source of income in the form of dividends even if we have not yet collected any cash in respect of such investments 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued changes to disclosure requirements for fair value measurements which resulted in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
these changes become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this standard beginning on january  our implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our process for measuring fair values  our financial position or our results of operations 
current market conditions overall economic conditions in the united states have improved  albeit marginally 
however  the economic recovery has been hampered by slower growth and persistent high unemployment levels 
the us congressional budget office is forecasting continuing sluggish growth for the remainder of  with a projected unemployment rate exceeding at year end 
further  the banking industry continues to experience additional bank failures as regulators continue to impose strict capital requirements 
additionally  future economic expansion and business investment is threatened by perceptions of higher taxes and healthcare costs  as well as the high levels of government deficit spending 
market conditions for business transactions including mergers and acquisitions and private equity investments improved throughout and continued through  as corporations have been deleveraging and are holding significant amounts of cash and many have begun to focus on acquisitions as part of future growth plans 
private equity firms have access to historically large amounts of committed capital as private equity activity has been lower than anticipated for nearly three years and fund raising remains significantly lower now than prior to the economic downturn 
consistent with other companies in the financial services sector  our performance has been adversely affected 
between december  and december  our net asset value declined from per share to per share 
this further impacted the trading price of our common stock  as it declined approximately during and further declined during  but increased during as of december   our common stock is trading at a discount to our net asset value 
over the past several years  we have executed certain initiatives to enhance liquidity  achieve a lower operational cost structure  provide more assistance to portfolio companies and realize certain of our portfolio investments 
specifically  we changed the composition of our board of directors and management  terminated certain of our follow on investments  internalized the management of the fund  suspended our managed distribution policy  modified our investment strategy to pursue shorter term liquidation opportunities  pursued non cash investment opportunities  and sold certain of our legacy and underperforming investment holdings 
we believe these actions continue to be necessary to protect capital and liquidity during this turbulent economic period in order to preserve and enhance shareholder value 
because our management is internalized  certain of our expenses should not increase commensurate with an increase in the size of the fund and  therefore  we expect to achieve efficiencies in our cost structure if we are able to grow the fund 
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash primarily from maturities  sales of securities and borrowings  as well as capital gains realized upon the sale of portfolio investments 
we use cash primarily to make additional investments  either in new companies or as follow on investments in the existing portfolio companies and to pay the dividends to our stockholders 
we are currently evaluating the impact of current market conditions on our portfolio company valuations and their ability to provide current income 
we have followed valuation techniques in a consistent manner  however  it is cognizant of current market conditions that might effect future valuations of portfolio securities 
we believe that our operating cash flow and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and to finance routine capital expenditures through the next twelve months

the company believes its product is the only product on the market that allows tracking of the last mile within feet of the transmitter 
once law enforcement knows it is close to a suspect  it can generally  then utilize a handheld device to locate the individual in a building or small radius area 
the company leases its transmitters to banks on a per unit basis and has relationships with a number of different banks from international commercial banks to community thrifts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates with respect to investments in debt securities and outstanding debt payable  as well as changes in marketable equity security prices 
in the future  in addition to our investment in opg shares and the new opg notes  we may invest in companies outside the united states  including in europe and asia  which would give rise to exposure to foreign currency value fluctuations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
the return on investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our investments in portfolio securities consist of some fixed rate debt securities 
since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate  changes in interest rates do not directly affect interest income 
in addition  changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in the determination of fair value of these debt securities  since the securities are generally held to maturity 
we determine their fair values based on the terms of the relevant debt security and the financial condition of the issuer 
a major portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt and equity investments in private companies 
modest changes in public market equity prices generally do not significantly impact the estimated fair value of these investments 
however  significant changes in market equity prices can have a longer term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains or losses realized on these investments 
a small portion of the investment portfolio also consists of common stocks in publicly traded companies 
these investments are directly exposed to equity price risk  in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities 
we are classified as a non diversified investment company under the investment company act  which means we are not limited in the proportion of our assets that may be invested in the securities of a single user 
the value of one segment called energy includes one portfolio company and was of the net asset value and of our investments in portfolio company securities at fair value as of december  changes in business or industry trends or in the financial condition  results of operations  or the market s assessment of any single portfolio company will affect the net asset value and the market price of our common stock to a greater extent than would be the case if we were a diversified company holding numerous investments
