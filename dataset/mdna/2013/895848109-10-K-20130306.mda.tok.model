in september  we entered into a four year senior secured credit facility to provide additional liquidity in support of our investment and operational activities 
the credit facility  which has an initial commitment of million supported by nine financial institutions  replaced our million senior secured credit facility  or the prior facility 
we entered into the prior facility in may with an initial commitment of million  which was increased to million in november the credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for an increase in the total commitment size up to million  subject to certain conditions  and also contains two one year extension options  bringing the total potential borrowing term to six years from closing 
the credit facility  which is structured to operate like a revolving credit facility  is secured primarily by our assets  excluding the assets of triangle sbic and triangle sbic ii 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  subject to our election  on a per annum basis equal to i the applicable base rate plus or ii the applicable libor rate plus 
the applicable base rate is equal to the greater of i prime rate  ii the federal funds rate plus or iii the adjusted one month libor plus 
we pay a commitment fee of per annum on undrawn amounts  which is included with interest and other financing fees on our consolidated statement of operations 
borrowings under the credit facility are also limited to a borrowing base  which includes certain cash and a portion of eligible debt investments

as with the prior facility  the credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants  including but not limited to i maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio  ii maintaining minimum consolidated tangible net worth and iii maintaining its status as a regulated investment company and as a bdc

table of contents in october  we issued million of senior notes and in november  we issued million of senior notes 
the senior notes mature on december   and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after december  the senior notes bear interest at a rate of per year payable quarterly on march  june  september and december of each year  beginning december  the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes  after underwriting discounts and offering expenses  were approximately million 
the indentures relating to the senior notes and the senior notes contain certain covenants  including but not limited to i a requirement that we comply with the asset coverage requirements of the act or any successor provisions  and ii a requirement that we provide financial information to the holders of the notes and the trustee under the indenture if we should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of distributions to stockholders we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  and intend to make the required distributions to our stockholders as specified therein 
in order to qualify as a ric and to obtain ric tax benefits  we must meet certain minimum distribution  source of income and asset diversification requirements 
if such requirements are met  then we are generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute actually or constructively and certain built in gains 
we met our minimum distribution requirements for  and and continually monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the code 
the minimum distribution requirements applicable to rics require us to distribute to our stockholders each year at least of our investment company taxable income  or icti  as defined by the code 
depending on the level of icti earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward icti in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such excess 
any such carryover icti must be distributed before the end of the next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such icti 
icti generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses 
we may be required to recognize icti in certain circumstances in which we do not receive cash 
for example  if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount such as debt instruments issued with warrants  we must include in icti each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation  regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year 
we may also have to include in icti other amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as i pik interest income and ii interest income from investments that have been classified as non accrual for financial reporting purposes 
interest income on non accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes  but generally is recognized in icti 
because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our icti for the year of accrual  we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements  even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount 
icti also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized 
current market conditions we were able to secure access to additional liquidity in  including public offerings of common stock and debt securities  new leverage through sba guaranteed debentures and entering into an expanded credit facility 
there can be no assurances  however  that the current market conditions will continue and that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms  if it all 
in  the debt and equity capital markets in the united states were severely impacted by significant write offs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the re pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated bank loan market  among other factors 
these events  along with the deterioration of the housing market  led to an economic recession in the us and abroad 
banks  investment companies and others in the financial services industry reported significant write downs in the fair value of their assets  which led to the failure of a number of banks and investment companies  a number of 
table of contents distressed mergers and acquisitions  the government take over of the nation two largest government sponsored mortgage companies 
these events significantly impacted the financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole  and for financial firms in particular 
notwithstanding recent gains across both the equity and debt markets  recent us budget deficit concerns and uncertainty regarding potential federal spending cuts and the federal debt ceiling  together with continued signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in europe  have increased the possibility that these unfavorable conditions in the debt and equity capital markets may reoccur in the future and could then continue for a prolonged period of time 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by such financial statements 
we have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the matters described below 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies follows 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
we have established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring quarterly basis in accordance with fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc topic under asc topic  a financial instrument is categorized within the asc topic valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input to the valuation process that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the three levels of valuation inputs established by asc topic are as follows level inputs include quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs include inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
our investment portfolio is comprised of debt and equity instruments of privately held companies for which quoted prices or other inputs falling within the categories of level and level are not available 
therefore  we determine the fair value of our investments in good faith using level inputs  pursuant to a valuation policy and process that is established by our management with the assistance of certain third party advisors and subsequently approved by our board of directors 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon the specific circumstances of each individual investment 
the recorded fair values of our investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
our valuation process is led by our executive officers and managing directors 
the valuation process begins with a quarterly review of each investment in our investment portfolio by our executive officers and our investment committee 
valuations of each portfolio security are then prepared by our investment professionals  who have direct responsibility for the origination  management and monitoring of each investment 
under our valuation policy  each investment valuation is subject to i a review by the lead investment officer responsible for the portfolio company investment and ii a peer review by a second investment officer or executive officer 
generally  any investment that is valued below cost is subjected to review by one of our executive officers 
after the peer review is complete  we engage two independent valuation firms  duff phelps  llc and lincoln partners advisors llc collectively  the 
table of contents valuation firms  to provide third party reviews of certain investments  as described further below 
finally  the board of directors has the responsibility for reviewing and approving  in good faith  the fair value of our investments in accordance with the act 
the valuation firms provide third party valuation consulting services to us which consist of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested the valuation firms to perform hereinafter referred to as the procedures 
the procedures are performed with respect to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year and for new portfolio companies  at least once in the twelve month period subsequent to the initial investment 
in addition  the procedures are generally performed with respect to a portfolio company when there has been a significant change in the fair value of the investment 
in certain instances  we may determine that it is not cost effective  and as a result is not in our stockholders best interest  to request the valuation firms to perform the procedures on one or more portfolio companies 
such instances include  but are not limited to  situations where the fair value of the investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio 
the total number of investments and the percentage of our portfolio that we asked the valuation firms to perform such procedures on are summarized below by period for the quarter ended total companies percent of total investments at fair value march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter 
upon completion of the procedures  the valuation firms concluded that  with respect to each investment reviewed by each valuation firm  the fair value of those investments subjected to the procedures appeared reasonable 
our board of directors is ultimately responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith 
investment valuation inputs under asc topic  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date 
for our portfolio securities  fair value is generally the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security 
under asc topic  the fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security  or in the absence of a principal market  in the most advantageous market for the security 
under asc topic  if no market for the security exists or if we do not have access to the principal market  the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market 
the securities in which we invest are generally only purchased and sold in merger and acquisition transactions  in which case the entire portfolio company is sold to a third party purchaser 
as a result  unless we have the ability to control such a transaction  the assumed principal market for our securities is a hypothetical secondary market 
the level inputs to our valuation process reflect management s best estimate of the assumptions that would be used by market participants in pricing the investment in a transaction in a hypothetical secondary market 

table of contents enterprise value waterfall approach in valuing equity securities including warrants  we estimate fair value using an enterprise value waterfall valuation model 
we estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company and then allocate the enterprise value to the portfolio company s securities in order of their relative liquidation preference 
in addition  the model assumes that any outstanding debt or other securities that are senior to our equity securities are required to be repaid at par 
additionally  we estimate the fair value of a limited number of its debt securities using the enterprise value waterfall approach in cases where we do not expect to receive full repayment 
to estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company  we primarily use a valuation model based on a transaction multiple  which generally is the original transaction multiple  and measures of the portfolio company s financial performance 
in addition  we consider other factors  including but not limited to i offers from third parties to purchase the portfolio company  ii the implied value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company  iii publicly available information regarding recent sales of private companies in comparable transactions and  iv when management believes there are comparable companies that are publicly traded  we perform a review of these publicly traded companies and the market multiple of their equity securities 
the significant level inputs to the enterprise value waterfall model are i an appropriate transaction multiple and ii a measure of the portfolio company s financial performance  which generally is either earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted  or adjusted ebitda  or revenues 
such inputs can be based on historical operating results  projections of future operating results  or a combination thereof 
the operating results of a portfolio company may be unaudited  projected or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for certain non recurring items 
in determining the operating results input  we utilize the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts available as of the valuation date 
management also consults with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development  loss of customers and other operational issues 
additionally  we consider some or all of the following factors financial standing of the issuer of the security  comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results  the size of the security held  pending public offering of common stock by the issuer of the security  pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer  such as merger or debt restructuring  ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing  changes in the economy affecting the issuer  financial statements and reports from portfolio company senior management and ownership  the type of security  the security s cost at the date of purchase and any contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security  special reports prepared by analysts  information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security and or sales to third parties of similar securities  the issuer s ability to make payments and the type of collateral  the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer  statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similar securities  and other pertinent factors 

table of contents fair value measurements using the enterprise value waterfall model can be sensitive to significant changes in one or more of the inputs 
a significant increase in either the transaction multiple  adjusted ebitda or revenues for a particular equity security would result in a higher fair value for that security 
income approach in valuing debt securities  we utilize an income approach model that considers factors including  but not limited to  i the stated yield on the debt security  ii the portfolio company s current trailing twelve months  or ttm adjusted ebitda as compared to the portfolio company s historical or projected adjusted ebitda as of the date the investment was made and the portfolio company s anticipated adjusted ebitda for the next twelve months of operations  iii the portfolio company s current leverage ratio defined as the portfolio company s total indebtedness divided by adjusted ebitda as compared to its leverage ratio as of the date the investment was made  iv publicly available information regarding current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of private companies and v when management believes a relevant comparison exists  current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of publicly traded debt 
in addition  we use a risk rating system to estimate the probability of default on the debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
this risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities held 
we consider the factors above  particularly any significant changes in the portfolio company s results of operations and leverage  and develop an expectation of the yield that a hypothetical market participant would require when purchasing the debt investment the required rate of return 
the required rate of return  along with the leverage ratio and adjusted ebitda are the significant level inputs to the income approach model 
for investments where the leverage ratio and adjusted ebitda have not fluctuated significantly from the date the investment was made or have not fluctuated significantly from management s expectations as of the date the investment was made  and where there have been no significant fluctuations in the market pricing for such investments  we may conclude that the required rate of return is equal to the stated rate on the investment and therefore  the debt security is appropriately priced 
in instances where we determine that the required rate of return is different from the stated rate on the investment  we discount the contractual cash flows on the debt instrument using the required rate of return in order to estimate the fair value of the debt security 
fair value measurements using the income approach model can be sensitive to significant changes in one or more of the inputs 
a significant increase decrease in the required rate of return or leverage ratio inputs for a particular debt security may result in a lower higher fair value for that security 
a significant increase decrease in the adjusted ebitda input for a particular debt security may result in a higher lower fair value for that security 
the fair value of our royalty rights are calculated based on specific provisions contained in the pertinent operating or royalty agreements 
the determination of the fair value of such royalty rights is not a significant component of our valuation process 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of original issue discount  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
generally  when interest and or principal payments on a loan become past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
the cessation of recognition of such interest will negatively impact the reported fair value of the investment 
we write off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible 
dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
we may have to include in our icti  interest income  including oid income  from investments that have been classified as non accrual for financial reporting purposes 
interest income on non accrual investments is not 
table of contents recognized for financial reporting purposes  but generally is recognized in icti 
as a result  we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements to maintain our ric status  even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount 
additionally  any loss recognized by us for federal income tax purposes on previously accrued interest income will be treated as a capital loss 
fee income origination  facility  commitment  consent and other advance fees received in connection with the origination of a loan  or loan origination fees  are recorded as deferred income and recognized as investment income over the term of the loan 
upon prepayment of a loan  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as investment income 
in the general course of our business  we receive certain fees from portfolio companies  which are non recurring in nature 
such fees include loan prepayment penalties  certain investment banking and structuring fees and loan waiver and amendment fees  and are recorded as investment income when received 
payment in kind pik interest income we currently hold  and we expect to hold in the future  some loans in our portfolio that contain a pik interest provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is periodically added to the principal balance of the loan  rather than being paid to us in cash  and is recorded as interest income 
thus  the actual collection of pik interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment 
to maintain our status as a ric  pik interest  which is a non cash source of income  is included in our taxable income and therefore affects the amount we are required to pay to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
generally  when current cash interest and or principal payments on a loan become past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and will generally cease recognizing pik interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
we write off any previously accrued and uncollected pik interest when it is determined that the pik interest is no longer collectible 
we may have to include in our icti  pik interest income from investments that have been classified as non accrual for financial reporting purposes 
interest income on non accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes  but generally is recognized in icti 
as a result  we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements  even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements topic  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  or asu asu clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements  changes the application of some requirements for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosure for fair value measurements categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy 
asu was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this standard on january  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our process for measuring fair values or on our financial statements  other than the inclusion of additional required disclosures 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events  including those directly involving the companies we invest in  conditions affecting the general 
table of contents economy  overall market changes  legislative reform  local  regional  national or global political  social or economic instability  and interest rate fluctuations 
the u 
s economy recently experienced a severe recession 
to the extent that recessionary conditions recur  the economy remains stagnate  any further downgrades to us government s sovereign credit rating occur  the european credit crisis continues  or the economy fails to return to pre recession levels  the financial position and results of operations of certain of the lower middle market companies in our portfolio could be further affected adversely  which ultimately could lead to difficulty in our portfolio companies meeting debt service requirements and lead to an increase in defaults 
there can be no assurance that the performance of our portfolio companies will not be further impacted by economic conditions  which could have a negative impact on our future results 
during  we experienced a million increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio related to unrealized appreciation of investments 
during  we experienced a million increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio related to unrealized appreciation of investments and in  we experienced a million increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio related to unrealized appreciation of investments  exclusive of million of unrealized depreciation reclassification adjustments related to certain realized gains and losses discussed above in item of part ii of this annual report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of our non accrual assets was approximately million  which comprised approximately of the total fair value of our portfolio  and the cost of our non accrual assets was approximately million  or of the total cost of our portfolio 
in addition to our non accrual assets  as of december   we had debt investments in one portfolio company our subordinated notes to home physicians that are on non accrual only with respect to the pik interest component of the loans 
as of december   the fair value of these debt investments was approximately million  or of the total fair value of our portfolio and the cost of these assets was approximately million  or of the total cost of our portfolio 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities 
changes in interest rates can also affect  among other things  our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio 
our investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates 
our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks 
we regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk and determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we were not a party to any hedging arrangements 
as of december   approximately  or million at cost of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at fixed rates and approximately  or million at cost of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates  which are either prime based or libor based 
a basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates on our variable rate debt investments would increase or decrease  as applicable  our investment income by approximately million on an annual basis 
all of our pooled sba guaranteed debentures  our senior notes and our senior notes bear interest at fixed rates 
our credit facility bears interest  subject to our election  on a per annum basis equal to i the applicable base rate plus or ii the applicable libor rate plus 
the applicable base rate is equal to the greater of i prime rate  ii the federal funds rate plus or iii the adjusted one month libor plus 
because we currently borrow  and plan to borrow in the future  money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  
table of contents our cost of funds would increase  which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio 
related party transactions during the three years ending december  there were no related party transactions between triangle capital corporation and any of its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations as of december   our future fixed commitments for cash payments are as follows total to to and thereafter sba guaranteed debentures payable interest due on sba guaranteed debentures payable pooled interest due on sba guaranteed debentures payable unpooled credit facility borrowings interest and fees on credit facility unused commitments to extend credit senior notes interest on senior notes operating lease payments total the million of sba debentures that were unpooled bear interest at an interim rate of through march   after which a permanent year fixed rate will apply 
were the million of unpooled sba debentures to be assigned the same rate as the most recent previously pooled sba debentures  an additional million of interest will be due in  million would be due in and  million would be due in and and million would be due in and thereafter 
amounts represent unused credit facility fees calculated at a rate of of the unused amount  which was million as of december we lease our corporate office facility under an operating lease that terminates on december  we believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our needs through  and that we will be able to obtain additional space when  where and as needed on acceptable terms 
recent developments in february  our board of directors granted  restricted shares of our common stock to certain employees 
these restricted shares had a total grant date fair value of approximately million  which will be expensed on a straight line basis over each respective award s vesting period 
in march  we voluntarily prepaid million in sba guaranteed debentures that had a weighted average interest rate of
